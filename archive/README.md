- Understand the landscape of information sources across different topics
- Analyze patterns in source types, organizational structures, and funding models
- Support media literacy and source credibility assessment
- Enable data-driven research on information ecosystems

## Todo

- Develop automated method of annotating non-profit/for-profit status.

## Use Cases
