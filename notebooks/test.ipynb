       "'---\\ntitle: \"Fix Our Forests Act: A Bipartisan Breakthrough for America’s Forests\"\\ndate: \"Oct 22, 2025\"\\nurl: \"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/fix-our-forests-act-a-bipartisan-breakthrough-for-americas-forests/\"\\ntype: \"Blog Post\"\\ntags: [\"Energy Policy\"]\\npolicy_areas: [\"Energy\"]\\nrelated_people: [\"Sean Babington\", \"Mariam Al-Shamma\"]\\n---\\n\\nOn October 21, 2025, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry voted 18-5 to advance the [Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1462/text). This strong bipartisan vote on comprehensive forestry legislation—shepherded by Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AK) and the committee’s ranking member, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)—marks yet another milestone in policymakers’ renewed focus on consensus-driven reforms to govern America’s forested lands. FOFA _,_ a version of which has already passed the House with support from both parties, provides a host of new authorities and tools for the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and its partners to manage, restore, and enhance our nation’s forested lands.\\n\\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center’s [Farm and Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/carbon-solutions-task-force/) provided Congress a variety of forest policy recommendations in its 2021 [report](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BPC_Farm_and_Forest_ExecutiveSummary_FINAL-1.pdf). The sponsors of the Senate’s FOFA legislation—Sens. John Curtis (R-UT), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Alex Padilla (D-CA)—incorporated many of the task force’s recommendations in the committee-passed version of FOFA, including:\\n\\n  * A coordinated approach to reforestation research, nursery capacity, and collection of tree seeds, allowing the USFS and partners to accelerate reforestation efforts in the wake of wildfires and other disturbances.\\n  * An all-of-government approach to mitigate the threat of uncharacteristic wildfires by equipping USFS’s land managers with new tools, including streamlined permitting for science-based forest health projects and reforms to dispute resolution over forest management projects.\\n  * An increased focus on wildfire mitigation and forest health projects across federal, state, or private ownership boundaries on forested lands.\\n  * A renewed emphasis on USFS research and the promise of innovative forest products, which can help drive new markets for low diameter (and previously low-value) forest materials—the exact types of trees that need to be removed from overstocked forests across the country to reduce wildfire risk.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommittee passage of FOFA comes on the heels of several other recent farm and forestry legislation milestones. Since the start of the 115th Congress in 2017, lawmakers have passed—and presidents have signed into law—no fewer than five major pieces of forestry reform legislation, arguably the most consequential period in forestry-related legislating since the USFS was established 120 years ago. Although not all these bills were passed on a bipartisan basis, it is notable that Congresses controlled by both parties have passed important forestry legislation including:\\n\\n  1. [Title 8 (Forestry Title) of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 ](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Conference%20Report%20Summaries.pdf)(2018 Farm Bill)[1], which enshrined a host of notable reforms to the management of National Forest System Land (NFS) lands including nationwide expansion of the revenue sharing provisions governing the “Good Neighbor” program[2]; a new categorical exclusion to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to improve wildlife habitat conditions on NFS lands[3]; new leasing authority for surface development on Forest Service administrative sites[4]; and new pilot authority for tribes to perform many roles managing NFS lands that were previously only available to the USFS.[5]\\n  2. Division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018[6], which provided the Forest Service [unique new budget flexibility](https://www.stateforesters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wildfire-Funding-Fix-ONE-PAGER.pdf) to allow for certain wildfire suppression efforts to be funded with “emergency” resources rather than regular appropriations[7]. Additionally, this legislation created a new NEPA categorical exclusion to mitigate wildfire risks and made a major change to the level of consultation required under the Endangered Species Act for certain forest management projects on NFS lands.[8]\\n  3. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law[9][ contained significant new authority and resources](https://www.americanforests.org/article/celebrating-the-infrastructure-bill-a-win-for-americas-forests/) including section 40807, which gave the Agriculture Secretary the authority to declare emergencies on NFS lands and subsequently speed the NEPA analysis the Department must carry out when planning projects within the boundaries of the emergency area.\\n  4. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which provided nearly $5 billion in mandatory spending to the Forest Service to carry out a [variety of restoration efforts](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN11978) across forested lands.[10]\\n  5. The 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s section 50301, which outlines significant new policy direction relating to the management of our national forests.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe United States continues to learn about the [threats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/09/11/spotted-lantern-flies-dc-mid-atlantic-swarms/) to our forests and their adjacent rural communities. Whether it’s catastrophic wildfire driven by too many hazardous trees, insect and disease infestations accelerated by a warming climate, or the economic struggles of the forest products industry, Congress and the broader stakeholder community need to continue to invest in, conserve, and maintain America’s forests.\\n\\nAs the 119th Congress advances FOFA and moves toward reauthorizing the Farm Bill, it will be taking important steps to protect and restore America’s forested lands. In addition, the administration needs to use tools [already at its disposal](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/07/22/agriculture-climate-law-hits-a-wall-at-usda-00467025) to drive private sector markets that can help finance and accelerate needed forest restoration treatments. Finally, the forestry community should continue to foster consensus-based dialogues to shape the next generation of policies to conserve our forests. BPC stands ready to play a leadership role in these endeavors. Only through sustained, bipartisan efforts can we prepare our forest landscapes and institutions for the inevitable challenges that lie ahead.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Endnotes\\n\\n  1. Pub.
