    "# Profit Status Enrichment Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enriches information sources with profit status data by using the Google Gemini API to research each organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Automatically determine the profit status (non-profit, for-profit, government, mixed, or unknown) for sources in the Google Sheet and update the sheet with this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- **Credentials**: `credentials.json` file in the root directory (Google service account)\n",
    "- **API Key**: Gemini API key (entered at runtime)\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: google-genai, google-api-python-client\n",
    "- **Sheet Columns**: The sheet must have a `profit_status` column\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "1. Connects to Google Sheets and loads source data\n",
    "2. For each source without profit status:\n",
    "   - Uses Gemini API to research the organization\n",
    "   - Determines profit status with confidence level\n",
    "   - Updates the Google Sheet with the findings\n",
    "3. Applies rate limiting to respect API usage limits"

    "   \"Institute\", \"Foundation\", \"Council\", \"Association\", \"Inc.\", \"LLC\", \"Corp.\", \"Ltd.\"?\n",
    "3. Org type — is this a university center, a think tank, a government contractor,\n",
    "   a news organization, an international body, or an advocacy group?\n",
    "4. Country of origin — non-US organizations may use different legal structures\n",
    "   but still map to the same categories\n",

    "## Step 2: Apply decision rules for known hard cases\n",
    "- Congressional committees and US federal agencies → \"government\"\n",

    "- University centers and institutes (Baker Institute, Belfer Center) → \"non-profit\"\n",
    "  (classify by the parent institution's status, which is almost always non-profit)\n",
    "- Trade associations (AFL-CIO, NAM, Chamber of Commerce) → \"non-profit\"\n",
    "  (these are 501(c)(6) entities, legally non-profit despite representing business interests)\n",
    "- Consulting firms and media companies with no non-profit registration → \"for-profit\"\n",
    "- Organizations with both a lobbying/advocacy arm AND a research foundation → \"mixed\"\n",
