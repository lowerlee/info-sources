    "# Profit Status Enrichment Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enriches information sources with profit status data by using the Anthropic API to research each organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Automatically determine the profit status (non-profit, for-profit, government, mixed, or unknown) for sources in the Google Sheet and update the sheet with this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- **Credentials**: `credentials.json` file in the root directory (Google service account)\n",
    "- **API Key**: Anthropic API key (set as environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: anthropic, google-api-python-client\n",
    "- **Sheet Columns**: The sheet must have a `profit_status` column\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "1. Connects to Google Sheets and loads source data\n",
    "2. For each source without profit status:\n",
    "   - Uses Claude API to research the organization\n",
    "   - Determines profit status with confidence level\n",
    "   - Updates the Google Sheet with the findings\n",
    "3. Applies rate limiting to respect API usage limits"
