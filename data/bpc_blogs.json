    "content": "On October 21, 2025, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry voted 18-5 to advance the Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA). This strong bipartisan vote on comprehensive forestry legislation—shepherded by Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AK) and the committee’s ranking member, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)—marks yet another milestone in policymakers’ renewed focus on consensus-driven reforms to govern America’s forested lands. FOFA, a version of which has already passed the House with support from both parties, provides a host of new authorities and tools for the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and its partners to manage, restore, and enhance our nation’s forested lands. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Farm and Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force provided Congress a variety of forest policy recommendations in its 2021 report. The sponsors of the Senate’s FOFA legislation—Sens. John Curtis (R-UT), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Alex Padilla (D-CA)—incorporated many of the task force’s recommendations in the committee-passed version of FOFA, including: A coordinated approach to reforestation research, nursery capacity, and collection of tree seeds, allowing the USFS and partners to accelerate reforestation efforts in the wake of wildfires and other disturbances. An all-of-government approach to mitigate the threat of uncharacteristic wildfires by equipping USFS’s land managers with new tools, including streamlined permitting for science-based forest health projects and reforms to dispute resolution over forest management projects. An increased focus on wildfire mitigation and forest health projects across federal, state, or private ownership boundaries on forested lands. A renewed emphasis on USFS research and the promise of innovative forest products, which can help drive new markets for low diameter (and previously low-value) forest materials—the exact types of trees that need to be removed from overstocked forests across the country to reduce wildfire risk. Committee passage of FOFA comes on the heels of several other recent farm and forestry legislation milestones. Since the start of the 115th Congress in 2017, lawmakers have passed—and presidents have signed into law—no fewer than five major pieces of forestry reform legislation, arguably the most consequential period in forestry-related legislating since the USFS was established 120 years ago. Although not all these bills were passed on a bipartisan basis, it is notable that Congresses controlled by both parties have passed important forestry legislation including: Title 8 (Forestry Title) of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill), which enshrined a host of notable reforms to the management of National Forest System Land (NFS) lands including nationwide expansion of the revenue sharing provisions governing the “Good Neighbor” program; a new categorical exclusion to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to improve wildlife habitat conditions on NFS lands; new leasing authority for surface development on Forest Service administrative sites; and new pilot authority for tribes to perform many roles managing NFS lands that were previously only available to the USFS.

    "content": "The 2025 budget reconciliation law (H.R. 1) requires Medicaid departments to implement large policy and systems changes, such as more frequent eligibility determinations and new “community engagement” (work) requirements, while reducing federal spending on Medicaid. In light of these new requirements, federal and state policy experts have pointed to artificial intelligence (AI) and other forms of technology modernization to help states productively manage these demands, streamline operations, and make state administration more efficient. If AI can free up staff time and other resources, the increased bandwidth could help reduce new and existing administrative responsibilities on state Medicaid departments and ultimately make the program more efficient for the more than 70 million Americans it serves. This blog explores the opportunities and risks of leveraging AI in Medicaid administration, examines what states are already doing, and provides five guidelines to help policymakers harness AI’s potential while safeguarding beneficiaries. Signals from H.R. 1: Pressure to Modernize Medicaid to Ease Administrative Burden H.R. 1 isn’t a bill explicitly about artificial intelligence; its downstream effects will likely increase administrative complexity for states and prompt more discussion about using AI to manage that complexity. Currently, Medicaid programs are implementing policy and program changes to prepare for the reforms outlined in H.R. 1. These changes require new resources, such as staff time and funding to establish new system capabilities. For example, H.R. 1 requires Medicaid departments to administer work requirements for certain populations, more frequent redeterminations to ensure individuals are still eligible for Medicaid, and stricter eligibility rules. States are navigating these changes amidst an evolving and complex health care landscape marked with budget and administrative challenges and reduced federal spending on Medicaid. The law includes some targeted funding, including $200 million in FY26 to support states’ implementation of work requirements and $50 billion between FY26 and FY30 for the Rural Health Transformation Fund. BPC has heard from several state Medicaid departments that the funding is unlikely to fully cover the added administrative and programmatic requirements. As a result, states face mounting pressure to run their programs more efficiently. The new requirements could accelerate efforts already underway to modernize and digitize administrative processes, including the use of AI, to manage burdensome documentation, eligibility verification, and claims review. As the BPC AI 101 Fact Sheet on AI administrative tools notes, private health systems are already leveraging AI to reduce administrative burden by automating repetitive tasks, improving documentation accuracy, and enabling staff to focus more on direct care. At CMS, digital modernization is a significant part of their plan to improve care for beneficiaries, with a request for information on how to improve innovation and the health technology infrastructure. CMS is also piloting an income verification app in Louisiana and Arizona to connect directly to payroll and gig-economy data, enabling states to confirm eligibility without submitting paperwork. What’s the difference between Automation, Machine Learning, and Generative AI? Automation follows pre-set rules to complete tasks the same way every time.

    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering granting Texas primacy for Class VI well permitting. This would make Texas the third state to receive final authority to independently issue Class VI well permits in 2025, and the sixth overall. The number of applications for Class VI wells that inject carbon dioxide (CO2) in underground reservoirs has spiked in recent years, straining EPA’s permitting capacity and causing extensive delays. The granting of state primacy—already common for other EPA-administered well classes—reduces EPA’s permitting backlog and enables more efficient and timely approvals. This creates greater certainty for investors and unlocks domestic CO2 storage potential. Class VI Wells Are Vital Infrastructure Needed to Support Carbon Capture and Removal Projects Class VI wells are used to inject CO2 into deep rock formations where it is permanently stored. This process is known as “geologic sequestration” and is a critical component of U.S. carbon management efforts. The geologically sequestered CO2 is taken from a variety of sources, including carbon capture projects that reduce emissions from energy and industrial facilities and carbon removal technologies like direct air capture (DAC). Using a Class VI well for the geologic sequestration of CO2 is one of the qualifying methods for carbon storage under the 45Q tax credit. Under 45Q, which enjoys strong bipartisan support, companies receive a tax credit for every ton of CO2 permanently sequestered underground via a Class VI well (or stored or utilized via another specified pathway). In the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) that was signed into law in July 2025, Congress preserved and enhanced the 45Q tax credit, signaling continued support for carbon management through geologic sequestration and other pathways. That said, EPA’s proposal to significantly scale back the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program will, if implemented, complicate companies’ ability to demonstrate and report net carbon removals—a requirement to obtain the 45Q tax credit. State Primacy Is an Important Tool for Safe and Efficient Permitting Primacy is the authority granted by the EPA to a state, territory, or tribe to administer and enforce regulations, including those related to the protection of drinking water from underground injection. To receive primacy for any of the underground injection control (UIC) well classes administered by the EPA, a state must demonstrate that it has regulations equal to or stronger than federal ones. In recent years, both President Donald Trump’s and then-President Joe Biden’s administrations have sought to expedite the approval of Class VI wells by delegating primacy to individual states, reducing the number of permits in EPA’s queue and enhancing the agency’s permitting efficiency. Texas is currently poised to join Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming, and North Dakota as the only U.S. states that have Class VI primacy. The granting of state primacy can have a significant impact on EPA’s Class VI permitting backlog. When Louisiana received primacy in December 2023, 63 permits—over a quarter of the EPA’s total backlog at the time—were removed (see Figure 1 below).

    "content": "On September 12, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposed rule that would end reporting requirements for most economic sectors under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). For the parts of the oil and gas sector that are statutorily required by the Inflation Reduction Act to report their emissions, the rule would postpone reporting requirements until 2034. Approximately 8,000 U.S. facilities—representing large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection sites—currently report their emissions under the program. EPA, which plans to issue a final rule by mid-2026, has said the proposal aligns with President Trump’s broader deregulation push. EPA also states that reporting for most sectors is not currently required by law—unlike parts of the oil and gas sector, as noted above—and that the change would save $303 million per year from 2025-2033. However, ending reporting requirements under the GHGRP could have negative impacts for a number of U.S. businesses, particularly those engaged in the export of low-carbon goods, and those in the carbon capture and removal and the clean hydrogen production businesses. What Is the GHGRP? EPA established the GHGRP in 2009 in response to the 2008 Appropriations Act, which directed the agency “to require mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy of the United States.” Under the program, facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year must submit annual emissions reports to EPA, which aggregates and publishes the data yearly. Facilities in most sectors covered by the GHGRP began reporting in 2010. Notably, the GHGRP and the EPA rule establishing it do not require facilities to reduce or control their emissions. In its proposed rule, EPA asserts that it is statutorily required to collect GHG emissions data only from petroleum and natural gas segments subject to the Clean Air Act’s Waste Emissions Charge (WEC), introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act. Congress postponed implementation of the WEC to 2034 as part of the July 2025 reconciliation law, but relevant facilities are still required to report their emissions in the meantime. EPA is proposing that those oil and gas segments can suspend reporting for now—along with all the other economic sectors currently covered by the GHGRP—and will only need to restart reporting in 2034 when the WEC comes into effect. The postponement of required oil and gas sector reporting accounts for $256 million of the $303 million in annual savings estimated by EPA. What Is the Relationship Between the GHGRP and 45Q? The carbon sequestration tax credit (45Q) is closely linked with GHGRP requirements. Companies claiming 45Q receive a federal tax credit for every ton of carbon dioxide that is captured and sequestered underground, used in a qualified enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or natural gas recovery project and stored underground, or utilized for certain purposes. In January 2021, the IRS issued final guidance on 45Q that requires entities claiming the credit under the secure geologic storage pathway to meet GHGRP&hellip;",

    "content": "In September 2025, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published its draft Critical Minerals List which, when finalized, will shape federal investment, permitting decisions, and strategic planning for mineral development nationwide. In some ways, the list is like a roster for a sports team. Just like a coach or manager carefully selects players with certain skills and characteristics to give their team the best chance to win, USGS has identified a set of minerals it believes are the most critical for America’s economic and national security. The creation of this list and how minerals are selected dates back to an Executive Order President Donald Trump signed in 2017, which was later codified in the Energy Act of 2020. The law requires USGS to update its list and the methodology for mineral selection at least every three years, with the last update having occurred in 2022. The law also allows the Secretary of Interior to designate additional non-fuel minerals as critical minerals and include them on the finalized list. While the USGS list is a helpful and necessary tool for the federal government’s overall critical minerals strategy, it is important to note that there is no single, unified list of critical minerals across federal agencies. Much like you would not send a baseball team in to play a football game, federal agencies approach the issue of critical minerals with their own playbook tailored to their missions, priorities, and statutory directives. An overview of how each agency makes their critical mineral determinations can be found here. What Is the USGS List Used For? The USGS Critical Minerals List helps to inform federal policy and strategy, supply chain risks, stockpiles, scenario planning, and private investment. One of the most visible uses of the list is determining eligibility for federal programs and incentives, including streamlined permitting processes, like in Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015, known as FAST-41. For critical mineral projects, eligibility for FAST-41 is restricted to those minerals that appear on USGS’ list, and the benefits of inclusion are clear. FAST-41 provides coordinated and expedited multiagency reviews and limits the statute of limitations for litigation under the National Environmental Policy Act to two years. According to the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council’s fiscal year 2020 report to Congress, FAST-41 reduced timelines to complete an environmental impact statement by 45%. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also requires the Department of the Interior (DOI) to analyze permitting requirements that slow deployment of U.S. critical mineral projects. The law specifically requires DOI to propose regulatory and legislative changes that would accelerate the permitting process and develop performance metrics for evaluating the progress made in expediting permitting activities. This provision defines critical minerals as those included on USGS’s Critical Minerals List. However, it is important to note that some federal programs are tied to previous versions of the list. For example, the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit remains hardcoded to the 2022 list and will not be affected by the 2025&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress has allowed key health care “extenders” to expire—including Medicare’s Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH) initiative, which ended September 30, 2025. Without reauthorization, hospitals and patients face uncertainty about the future of home-based acute care. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) created AHCAH in 2020 during COVID-19 to allow CMS-approved hospitals to deliver hospital-level care at home to Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries. As of September 2025, CMS had approved 419 hospitals across 39 states, though not all operated programs. With the program’s lapse, CMS instructed hospitals to discharge or return patients to traditional brick-and-mortar inpatient facilities and stopped accepting new waiver requests. CMS guidance issued on October 1 noted that if a hospital is found out of compliance with the Physical Environment requirement (previously waived under AHCAH) it would be required to address the issue through a formal “plan of correction.” Hospitals typically have 60 days to submit an acceptable plan to CMS. BPC is speaking with stakeholders, including hospitals with existing AHCAH waivers, on the impacts to the lapsed waiver. While the guidance does not explicitly state a 60-day non-enforcement policy for patients admitted prior to the waiver lapse, some stakeholders BPC spoke with learned that this is the agency’s intention during the shutdown. This discretion would prevent hospitals from receiving a citation for patients admitted prior to the waiver lapse. It is unclear what a 60-day non-enforcement policy will mean in practice for hospitals since many of them have already discharged or returned patients to hospitals. Some hospitals are unwilling to take the risk because a citation could hurt their hospital standings. These hospitals have discharged or transitioned patients back to facilities, sometimes taking these steps earlier in September in anticipation Congress would fail to reauthorize the waiver.  Hospitals BPC spoke with have stopped admitting new fee-for-service Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to their programs, but many continue to serve other payers such as Medicare Advantage. While some hospitals said it would be helpful if CMS provided more clarification, BPC learned that the government shutdown and related furloughs make it more difficult for CMS to publish additional guidance or clarification on enforcement. Hospitals also face potential conflicts with state regulations, which adds to the regulatory uncertainty. This waiver lapse reinforces BPC’s recommendation and BPC Action’s call for Congress to extend AHCAH for five years. The Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the current Congress, would provide this extension. A policy expert BPC spoke with also highlighted the opportunity for a waiver extension to recognize new advancements in technology, such as remote patient monitoring. A longer extension would give hospitals more regulatory certainty, allow researchers to better evaluate the model, and expand access for a more diverse group of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It would also reduce the risk of disruptive lapses, like the current one, that undermine participation, slow Medicaid adoption, and limit Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries’ options to receive acute care in their homes.",

    "content": "Child care is more than an individual family support—it’s economic infrastructure that plays an essential, if often overlooked, role in the national economy. Access to affordable and quality child care encourages labor market participation for parents and builds economic stability for families. Conversely, gaps in child care access lead parents to scale back employment hours and overall productivity or leave the workforce altogether. Not only does this reduce short- and long- term financial stability for families, it also decreases business productivity. Without intervention to address these gaps, the American economy suffers. Recent estimates from the Bipartisan Policy Center and partners show gaps in child care could cost the economy as much as $329 billion over the next 10 years in lost productivity, workforce shortages, and decreased income and revenue. The Child Care Gaps Assessment doesn’t just map where supply falls short, but translates those gaps into real-dollar costs, showing the ripple effects well beyond individual households, as explored in more detail below. Understanding the Gap’s Economic Impact The Child Care Gaps Assessment presents users with clear insights into the scope and scale of child care access issues impacting working families from state and county levels down to congressional district, state senate district, and rural vs. urban communities—as we’ve discussed in previous articles on the child care gap. Connecting gaps in service delivery (the child care gap) to their direct fiscal burden (the economic impact) provides policymakers with concrete information to better address the very real challenges impacting working families and the economy. Estimates found that each gap in care costs the economy an estimated $51,688 to $78,689 over a 10-year period, a loss between $216.4 billion to $329.4 billion nationwide. Calculations were based on the initial and 10-year cumulative impacts of a lack of care on families, businesses, and government revenue streams. Households: The economic impact calculation estimates the annual earnings burden of the child care gap on individual households. Previous literature, including BPC survey research, points to a direct relationship between child care access and workforce participation. In particular, this is a concern for young mothers because women bear the brunt of care costs and challenges, disproportionately deterring mothers from entering or staying in the workforce. Businesses: Limited access to child care can impose significant costs on businesses. Reduced workforce participation among parents leads to productivity losses and lower outputs, while workforce exits drive higher turnover and greater recruitment and retention expenses. Moreover, a widespread decrease in household incomes, exacerbated by the rising cost of living, leads families to decrease non-essential spending, resulting in lower business revenues and contributing to a less robust economy. Tax Revenue: Household income losses and decreased business revenues ultimately impact the amount of tax revenue the government is able to collect. Local, state, and federal governments use tax revenues to invest in critical infrastructure such as roads, public education, health and social welfare services, and so on. Decreased revenue weakens the ability of governments to serve their citizens and directly impacts America’s economic competitiveness&hellip;",

    "content": "There has been long-standing bipartisan interest in expanding Pell Grants to short-term workforce programs. Now, Workforce Pell is about to become reality: Among its other provisions, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) expands federal Pell Grant eligibility to short-term job training programs that are fewer than 16 weeks in length. Workforce Pell extends federal financial aid to programs that were not previously eligible, allowing more students to receive assistance and likely increasing demand for short-term training programs. Although the Department of Education must still finalize key details on Workforce Pell implementation, existing state programs—like Virginia’s FastForward—provide useful perspective on how colleges can use Workforce Pell to help learners attain in-demand skills and credentials. Unlike Workforce Pell, FastForward focuses on noncredit training programs. Nevertheless, it provides insight for federal and state policymaker consideration into the learners participating in short-term programs and on the outcomes that well-designed programs can offer. Understanding Workforce Pell The past two decades have seen notable growth in nondegree credentials. In fall 2024, undergraduate enrollment in certificate programs increased by nearly 10%, compared to a 5% increase in undergraduate enrollment overall. Short-term and nondegree credentials can provide a path to upward mobility and higher earnings, especially for working adults without postsecondary credentials. To be eligible for Pell Grants, however, learners have had to enroll in programs that are 16 weeks or longer. Workforce Pell extends Pell Grant eligibility to programs that are eight to 15 weeks (between 150 and 600 clock hours) in length. States will be required to certify that programs prepare students for high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sectors or occupations. Programs must lead to a recognized postsecondary credential, demonstrate a 70% completion and job placement rate, and meet a value-added earnings test (median earnings for program completers minus 150% of the Federal Poverty Level must exceed program tuition and fees). Programs must also provide credit that articulates to one or more additional certificates or degree programs. It is still be determined whether noncredit programs that articulate to credit-bearing credentials will qualify. Short-term Training in Action: Virginia’s FastForward Program States have invested heavily in short-term credential pathways, with 32 states investing more than $5.6 billion in short-term credential initiatives as of late 2024. Louisiana’s MJ Foster Promise Program, for example, provides financial support for credential programs of two years or less aligned to high-demand jobs in growing industry sectors. In Connecticut, CareerConnectCT provides learners with career coaching and free access to short-term training programs. Virginia’s FastForward is another model that offers insights into outcomes from short-term programs. Virginia established FastForward in 2016 to fund noncredit career and technical education programs delivered through the Virginia Community College System. The initiative is specifically designed to address skills gaps and fill open jobs in high-demand industries like healthcare, IT, infrastructure, and other skilled trades. FastForward provides a pay-for-performance model with costs shared by the state, students, and the college, depending on student and institutional performance.

    "content": "Parents across the country have long relied on quality, affordable child care to help them work, pursue education, or complete on-the-job training. Access to affordable, quality care removes barriers for parents, especially mothers, to participate in the labor market and can facilitate economic stability for families, local communities, and the wider economy. Unfortunately, accessing care that meets their needs has become increasingly difficult for working families across the country. State and local policymakers, advocates, and businesses, cognizant of the critical role child care access plays in community economic development, continue to invest in new and innovative ways to tackle this challenge, but gaps in knowledge at the local level make it difficult to adequately tailor and scale programs to match need. The updated Child Care Gaps Assessment (the Assessment), an interactive tool from the Bipartisan Policy Center, Buffet Early Childhood Institute (BECI), and Child Care Aware of America (CCAoA), provides state and local stakeholders with comprehensive child care data at the state, county, congressional district, state senate district, and rural vs. urban levels. Stakeholders can leverage critical data from the Assessment to expand access to affordable care in their communities and support economic growth. As an interactive tool, users can explore comprehensive data on formal supply, potential need, and gaps in care at various community levels, allowing them to make data-driven decisions to build systems that more effectively met the needs of working families. Starting with Quality State Data The Child Care Gaps Assessment was first created to fill a critical information gap on the actual supply of formal child care in America. For the country to move towards a more comprehensive child care system that supports access for all working families, we first need to know how many formal slots exist (supply), and how many additional slots could be needed (potential need). Beginning in 2019, BPC began collecting data on the number of formal child care slots in licensed and registered programs for children under 5 years old, working with state child care and education agencies and relevant federal and tribal programs. It is important to note that supply estimates, while approved by states, are inherently reflective of their varied data governance practices, which can directly impact quality (as discussed below). When viewing the Assessment, states should consider, at minimum, the following opportunities to improve their existing child care data systems. Type of Data Collected: Most states only collect child care capacity data through their licensing system, meaning that supply counts are often calculated using only licensed or registered programs. Efforts are often designed to collect licensed capacity, related to a program’s building or room size, rather than current enrollment, and often don’t account for the exact ages of children served. Collecting real-time data on enrollment capacity provides a more accurate account of supply, as it reflects the enrollment impacts of challenges such as workforce shortages or facility issues. It can also give stakeholders a more accurate count of slots by age groups, which is critical to ensuring supply&hellip;",

    "content": "America was built on a shared belief in opportunity: the idea that every person, no matter their background, deserves a fair shot at the American dream. Today, that promise is slipping out of reach for too many. Automation, artificial intelligence, and global competition are reshaping industries and redefining the skills required to succeed. Every American community holds untapped talent – talent that we need to compete as a nation – but trust in the institutions that enable opportunity is eroding. Families face a child care crisis. Public schools and higher education institutions are failing too many students, leaving them disengaged, indebted, and unprepared for a rapidly changing world. Employers are desperate for capable, adaptable workers, yet millions of Americans remain sidelined — unemployed, underemployed, or locked out of the skills they need to get ahead. Our workforce is aging, shrinking, and evolving too slowly to meet the demands of the world economy. These are not future concerns. They are urgent, present-day challenges threatening our economic strength and global competitiveness. Across the country, people are yearning for a government that rises to meet the moment and forecasts the coming shifts — one that puts solutions ahead of politics and delivers meaningful change. We have been here before. When leaders prioritize progress over partisanship, government can be a powerful force for expanding opportunity. The GI Bill, Pell Grants, and the Elementary &amp; Secondary Education Act were all landmark legislative accomplishments forged by compromise that sparked decades of improvements for American veterans, students, workers, and families. These were national responses to urgent needs – not meant to solve every issue but rather to empower our citizens. We must act with that same resolve today. To support the upward mobility of every American everywhere, we need nimble education and workforce systems that are responsive to a competitive future and enable active citizenship. That starts with a modern federal role that reflects our shared values and adapts to today’s challenges and tomorrow’s opportunities – and extends directly to states, which now more than ever must step up to lead. Our federal and state systems must equip people with the skills and credentials the economy demands, while also nurturing the uniquely human qualities that cannot be automated. And we must uplift and support the families, educators, and professionals whose efforts are essential to our collective success. While education is a vital path to economic opportunity—it is more than that. It is the cornerstone of strong communities and an engaged, informed citizenry. The Commission on the American Workforce is outlining a new vision to advance the skills, knowledge, and experiences of our people, supported by a reimagined federal role that is grounded in the following principles: America needs a future-focused talent strategy. To meet both the current moment and a future where the government can respond quickly and effectively to evolving needs, tinkering around the edges of existing systems is not enough. Talent systems must be adaptable to the evolving needs of individuals and the economy. Rigid,&hellip;",

    "content": "Introduction Across the country, many working families face high costs of raising children. Rising child care costs, exacerbated by recent inflation, and inadequate workplace supports have forced many parents to work less or leave the workforce altogether. The consequences extend beyond families, undermining longer-term workforce participation, straining local businesses, and limiting the broader U.S. economy. While shifting attitudes around work and family have led to some progress, recent labor data shows larger losses in women’s labor force participation in 2025 due to workplace trends limiting flexibility and further straining family economic security. Moreover, recent research suggests that some women are having fewer children than they want to have primarily due to growing financial concerns and insufficient access to supports like child care or paid leave. While strengthening policy solutions for families with young children enjoys significant bipartisan support, there are differing approaches on how to best deliver those programs and prioritize them within the federal budget. Understanding what parents actually want and identifying which policies—such as tax incentives, paid leave, or child care—families value most can enable policymakers to craft solutions that meet those needs. Parents are Feeling the Squeeze The high costs of living nationwide leave many families struggling to afford basic needs like food and clothing, along with other expenses for child care and education. Over 70% of children under age five live in a household where parents work, making access to affordable, reliable child care critical for families and our economy. Yet the ongoing child care crisis, where the number of children needing care exceeds the number of formal slots available, makes access nearly impossible for millions, especially in rural communities. Despite these well-documented needs, few employers provide benefits that could directly help families with just 13% providing child care and 27% providing paid leave. One thing is clear: Families are feeling the squeeze and need more help balancing the demands of caregiving and work. Not only do children thrive when parents have the time, resources, and stability to care for them in their earliest years, but our economy would benefit as well. A new BPC poll reveals that parents with young children want more government funding for family support programs. The survey of parents with children under five years old, conducted by Cygnal, found that work-life balance and financial strain are the biggest challenges to raising children. The needs of both parents and children shift rapidly in a child’s early years. Parents not only want but need flexible solutions that help them manage the demands of work and caregiving in ways that meet their unique needs. Absent policy intervention, parents often choose to leave the workforce altogether, further straining the economy and business productivity. The good news? The poll shows that parents of children under five years old have clear preferences that can help policymakers shape solutions that center children and families at each stage of life. Notably, when welcoming a child, 65% of parents believe 12 weeks of paid parental leave at full pay with job protection would&hellip;",

    "content": "A growing lack of access to quality and reliable, affordable child care remains a major barrier to workforce participation for prime-age adults with young children. This gap in care often forces parents, especially mothers, to reduce their participation in the workforce—constraining labor supply and stifling economic growth in communities across the country. As a result, families struggle to make ends meet and employers struggle to retain talent, threatening economic stability. The Bipartisan Policy Center has partnered with the Buffet Early Childhood Institute (BECI) and Child Care Aware of America (CCAoA) to release the updated “Child Care Gaps Assessment,” available at childcaregap.org. This interactive tool presents the most comprehensive analysis of the child care gap: the number of children under the age of five who potentially need child care but do not have access to a formal spot within reasonable driving distance. The Assessment underscores the scale of America’s child care challenge: there is a 28.2% child care gap across the country, with almost 4.2 million children lacking access to a formal care slot in their community. This shortfall has consequences beyond families, extending to the broader economy. Data presented in the Assessment enables policymakers to identify durable solutions to support working families and our communities. What is the Child Care Gap Assessment? Before policymakers can improve child care access for working families, they need access to clear, comprehensive data on the child care field. That’s where the Child Care Gaps Assessment comes in, presenting users with key data: Child Care Supply: the number of slots offered by legally operating formal (licensed or registered) child care programs serving children five and under. Data was collected from state child care and education agencies, the Office of Head Start, American Indian and Alaskan Native tribes, and the Department of Defense. Potential Need: the number of children five and under who have all available parents in the workforce. Data was collected from the most recent 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). Child Care Gap: the difference between the number of children under five with the potential need for care and the number of formal child care slots (supply). Economic Impact: a calculation estimating the monetary impact of the child care gap on families, businesses, and the broader economy. The child care gap is calculated using a formula that considers the average distance a family drives from home to formal child care. Average driving distance—3.5 miles for urban areas and 10 miles for rural areas—was based off previous BPC parent surveys and household level data from Maine and Idaho on family driving distances from home to care. Gap data for each state was collected and analyzed between 2019 and 2025 (see data source years here). It is important to note that findings are inherently reflective of the quality and availability of each state’s child care data. The tool shows available data broken down by states, counties, congressional districts, state senate districts, and rural vs. urban areas. Findings show that the country only has around 10.8 million&hellip;",

    "content": "Despite all that the parties disagree on, there is a clear bipartisan consensus that congressional operations need improvement. The American public expects a modern government that is effective at serving its constituents, and for several years, the annual Congressional Hackathon has highlighted innovative ideas to help build a Congress that can better meet these expectations. On September 17th, Speaker Johnson and Leader Jeffries will host the seventh Congressional Hackathon in the Capitol Visitors Center. The bipartisan event brings together technologists from the private sector, congressional staff, and civil society to advance congressional modernization through technology, from proposals to innovate committee business, strengthen policymakers’ access to legislative data, and improve the quality and accessibility of constituent services. Origins and Purpose of the Hackathon The first Hackathon, held in 2011 in partnership with Facebook, was an experimental collaboration between the offices of then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. It was organized to explore how social media could improve the legislative process by empowering citizens to more meaningfully engage with Congress. There were additional events held in 2015, 2017, 2022, and in 2023, the House Chief Administrative Officer institutionalized the event following a recommendation from the bipartisan Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. The tangible successes generated by the Hackathon have been evident from the beginning. For example, a top recommendation from the first Hackathon was that videos of committee business be standardized and accessible to the public through a reliable platform. The recognition of this problem, combined with other internal changes to House operations, eventually led to videos of most committee hearings now being widely available on YouTube. The Hackathon has since evolved over time to tackle a broader range of issues and expanded the number and type of participants in attendance. Last year’s Hackathon even engaged students in the conversation by including presentations from participants of the Congressional App Challenge. A Successful Model for Congressional Cooperation The Hackathon is different from the typical events on Capitol Hill. Congress is often inundated with panels, roundtables, and speaker series that seek to shape the views of members and their staff on the issues of the day. Most of these events are presenter-oriented in the classic “sage-on-the-stage” style of lecturing followed by minimal question-and-answer periods at the end of the event. While these events do convey important policy information that congressional staff need, they are ultimately not designed for promoting networking and collaboration. The Hackathon is more interactive. It starts with a lightning session where participants show off a variety of technological ideas and solutions in various stages of development. These tools attempt to address a multitude of problems that congressional staff face in their daily workflow, including booking constituent tours and finding professional development opportunities. Importantly, most of these tools attempt to fill needs that have been identified by congressional staff themselves. During smaller breakout sessions, attendees discuss specific topics related to congressional operations to identify additional problems and dream up new possibilities to improve effectiveness and efficiency.

    "content": "The United States is experiencing a “trifecta” of mental health crises – affecting youth and young adults, people with serious mental illness, and those with substance use disorders. One sobering data point: a recent BPC survey found that 44% of teenagers and 62% of young adults regularly experience mental health distress, yet fewer than half seek professional help. These crises carry mounting human and financial costs for patients, families, providers, and payers. BPC has long worked to strengthen behavioral health care across the lifespan, and in 2024 we convened the Youth Mental Health and Substance Use Task Force to address the growing mental health crisis among youth and young adults. Since then, the use of digital solutions for mental health support has surged. BPC recently partnered with The Commonwealth Fund to host an event on these digital mental health solutions, focused on the role of policy in unlocking the promise of these tools and mitigating the risks. In recent years, significant public and private investment has spurred the launch of more than 400 companies focused on addressing the rise in mental health conditions through digital solutions. The mental health sector now leads all other areas of digital health investment. During the event, keynote speaker Dr. Tom Insel—former director of the National Institute of Mental Health and founder of several mental health start-ups—underscored the need for new approaches: “We need to look at how to innovate, how to transform, and how to change what we do,” he said. Yet, he noted, the industry has yet to demonstrate a measurable public health impact or deliver the expected reductions in morbidity and mortality – raising the question: why not? The panel discussion brought together Caroline Pearson, Executive Director of the Peterson Health Technology Institute (PHTI); Nick Jacobson, professor at Dartmouth College; and Sarah Hudson Scholle, principal at Leavitt Partners, in a conversation moderated by Anastassia Gliadkovskaya of Fierce Healthcare. The conversation explored the current landscape of digital mental health solutions, regulatory challenges, coverage dynamics, and the emerging role of generative AI in mental health care. What Are Digital Mental Health Solutions, and How Well Do They Work? Digital mental health solutions can refer to a wide range of products and services. PHTI recently evaluated a subset of these solutions for depression and anxiety, including: Self-guided tools, which offer validated digital content including videos, lessons, and activities for individuals to do on their own. FDA-approved prescription digital therapeutics, similar in structure to self-guided tools but used alongside traditional provider-led treatment. A provider who gives a patient psychotherapy on a regular basis, for example, may recommend that the patient complete these digitized behavioral interventions in between visits. Blended-care solutions, which combine self-guided tools with an integrated network of clinicians. These tools allow individuals to independently engage with digital content, but also step-up to more intensive care including psychotherapy, text-based therapy, and medication management. Pearson noted that all three categories have shown clinical effectiveness, and when used, “not only do they see symptom improvement, but they&hellip;",

Yet federal policy lags behind the times. Taking steps toward a comprehensive national policy on AI, the Trump Administration released its three-pillar AI Action Plan (Action Plan) on July 23. The plan proposes a national strategy for advancing U.S. leadership in AI and lays a foundation for shaping the next era of American innovation, competitiveness, and security. The Bipartisan Policy Center welcomes the plan’s release and is encouraged to see areas of strong alignment with our policy recommendations. Our four-part series delves into the Action Plan’s impact on four specific policy domains: energy, health, the workforce, and technology. In these blogs, we highlight both strong convergence and crucial areas where continued discussion and policy development are essential to fully realize the promise of AI for all Americans. AI is already impacting the energy industry, related infrastructure, and the pace of scientific innovation. But the energy sector faces complex, sector-specific challenges including limited grid connectivity, lagging clean energy development, and uncertainty around future energy demand and regulatory policies. The Action Plan underscores the urgent need to modernize the nation’s electric grid, streamline permitting, and support infrastructure capable of meeting surging electricity demand from AI and data centers. These proposals reflect BPC’s comments and work on advancing permitting reform, expanding access to supercomputing resources, and preparing the grid for rapid load growth. BPC encourages the administration to fully leverage the Department of Energy’s unique capabilities in AI, including world-class supercomputing infrastructure, deep scientific expertise, and cutting-edge AI applications for energy to ensure the U.S. remains at the forefront of both AI and energy innovation. A focus on delivering affordable, reliable, and clean energy also continues to be central to our nation’s economic competitiveness, energy security, and ability to realize the full benefits of AI innovation.

    "content": "As we highlighted in The Urgency of Bipartisanship in K-12 Education Policy, bipartisanship is an essential component of advancing education policy in Congress. But like many policy issues, when it comes to education, there isn’t a single “Democratic” or “Republican” view: the landscape is more complex, with some on the conservative end having more in common with progressives on certain issues. This makes it even more important to define terms and problems that need to be solved. For example, commonly used terms like “accountability” can mean a host of different policies, from financial audits to school report cards. Even less nuanced phrases – such such as “putting students first” or “let teachers teach” – while important, can be more about making political arguments than about education. One such issue that often sparks intense debate is local control in education: if both sides were to acknowledge the troubling historical context of local control, along with the need to be clear on differing perspectives of the federal role in education, we could be one step closer to having more meaningful policy debates. Generally speaking, members of both parties support a version of local control. But what kind of control, and what does local mean? Even those that prioritize it may not think through all its implications. Conservative lawmakers and policy advocates often call for restoring parental and local control over education, most recently through proposals regarding parental rights or to eliminate the Department of Education. They may favor rolling back federal programs and funding through the Department of Education and its many accompanying regulations that they argue have not left enough autonomy for school districts and schools to do right by kids. Basically, that federal investments and rules are impeding student success. The growth of public charter schools, however, is one example that shows local control and federal involvement aren’t mutually exclusive. Charter schools enable local educators and leaders to have significant autonomy to design an educational program for their students and to provide choices for parents. But the federal government has played a pretty big role in helping to grow the charter school sector. More than thirty years ago, because local districts and states were reluctant to provide charter schools with start-up costs, the federal government stepped in by authorizing the Charter Schools Program (CSP) to provide start-up funds. Today, the program is responsible for nearly 50 percent of the charter schools that are open and serve 3.8 million students. This growth demonstrates that “local” control is more than empowering parents and families. Progressives for their part often have concerns with allowing too much local control based on the nation’s history. In the 1960s, segregationists often invoked the concept of &#8220;local control&#8221; to resist federal mandates for desegregation. One prominent example in this era was Alabama Gov. George Wallace’s use of &#8220;local control&#8221; over schools to maintain segregation, or court cases that prevented broader desegregation efforts citing local control, such as Milliken v. Bradley. Wallace&#8217;s stance and the Court’s were part&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 24, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 14321, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets,” outlining sweeping changes in federal homelessness policy. The order marks a sharp break from two decades of federal consensus around the Housing First model, which prioritizes permanent housing and voluntary services. Instead, it centers behavioral health as the primary focus of homelessness policy, introducing mandates and enforcement mechanisms intended to reshape how assistance is delivered and who is eligible. This blog breaks down key changes to federal policy, provides context from BPC analysis of homelessness trends, identifies potential implementation challenges, and reviews recent research on the structural and economic drivers fueling the rise in homelessness. What President Trump's Executive Order Does 1 Limits federal support for Housing First — HUD and HHS are directed to revise regulations, grant requirements, and guidance to end support for Housing First policies that, in the administration’s view, deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency. 2 Conditions housing assistance on behavioral health treatment — HUD and HHS are instructed to ensure federal housing programs require, where possible, active participation in treatment for substance use disorders or severe mental illness. 3 Prioritizes support for jurisdictions enforcing public safety laws — Agencies are directed to prioritize jurisdictions that enforce bans on urban camping, loitering, squatting, and open-air drug use when awarding discretionary grants. 4 Encourages expansion of involuntary civil commitment — DOJ is directed to seek reversal of judicial precedents and consent decrees that limit civil commitment and to support states in adopting more flexible commitment and treatment laws. 5 Restricts harm reduction efforts — DOJ must assess whether federally funded organizations that operate safe consumption sites, distribute drug paraphernalia, or allow on-site illicit drug use are violating federal law, and initiate enforcement actions where applicable. 6 Mandates interagency data sharing with law enforcement — HHS, HUD, and DOJ are instructed to develop policies to collect and share behavioral health and homelessness data with law enforcement authorities, where permitted by law. Context The order comes amid intensifying national concern over homelessness. The latest federal Point-in-Time (PIT) count recorded more than 770,000 people experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2024—an 18% increase over the previous year and the largest annual jump ever recorded. Approximately one-third of those counted were living unsheltered. Recent state and national polls show that respondents view rising homelessness as a top issue and express concern about the perceived impact of unsheltered homelessness on public safety. Note: The graph does not display some data points from 2021 because of pandemic-related disruptions to counts. Source: 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, HUD The order also follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, which upheld the authority of local governments to enforce ordinances banning public camping and sleeping, even when individuals lack access to shelter. That ruling laid the legal foundation for a wave of encampment bans in more than 100 cities, across both Democratic- and Republican-led states. The order&hellip;",

AI Action Plan and Workforce At a recent BPC event, officials from the Departments of Education and Labor highlighted how the Action Plan builds on recent Executive Orders to advance AI education and strengthen the industrial workforce. On August 12 the administration released America’s Talent Strategy, a plan to update our national workforce development strategy for the 21st century. “Last week, the AI Action Plan came out and made an argument that workers need to be central to an overall national AI strategy. What you will see in the workforce report, when it’s public, is that we’re also integrating how AI will reshape the labor market and what are the types of supports and systems that need to be in place to support workers.” — Taylor Stockton, Chief Innovation Officer, U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) The Action Plan highlights both the opportunities of AI—including productivity gains and new jobs—and the need to help workers navigate the related disruption. BPC is encouraged to see inclusion of provisions similar to our past recommendations in areas such as AI literacy and building a skilled workforce. Much of the Action Plan also tackles issues being considered by our Commission on the American Workforce. However, the plan misses opportunities to attract and retain foreign-born talent and strengthen safety nets. Areas of Alignment in the Action Plan The Action Plan incorporates focus areas that BPC has consistently identified as essential to preparing the U.S. workforce for an AI-enabled world. Pillar 1 – Accelerate AI Innovation Accelerate AI Adoption in Government: Mandates federal agencies to train employees on AI tools, formalizes interagency coordination on AI adoption, and proposes an AI procurement toolbox to help agencies easily select and safely deploy AI systems.

Yet federal policy lags behind the times. Taking steps toward a comprehensive national policy on AI, the Trump administration released its three-pillar AI Action Plan on July 23. The plan focuses on accelerating U.S. innovation, building the infrastructure needed to power it, and leading globally in AI diplomacy and security. The plan proposes a foundation to shape the next era of American innovation, competitiveness, and security. The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) welcomes the plan’s release and is encouraged to see areas of alignment with our AI policy recommendations. Our four-part series delves into the Action Plan’s impact on specific policy domains: health, the workforce, energy, and technology. In these blogs, we highlight both strong convergence and areas where continued discussion and policy development are essential to fully realize the promise of AI for all Americans. AI Action Plan and Technology From spam filters to cybersecurity and productivity tools, AI is transforming how we build and use technology. The Action Plan recognizes that the U.S. must lead in not only developing powerful AI systems but also setting global standards. Highlights include building an evaluation ecosystem and world-class datasets, and supporting adoption through AI test beds and procurement toolboxes. The Action Plan builds on the current roles of key agencies that form the backbone of the AI ecosystem—the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at Department of Commerce, the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) at the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Labs at Department of Energy (DOE), and Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) programs at Department of Defense (DOD). Their coordination will be essential for turning vision and potential into real-world outcomes. Areas of Alignment in the Action Plan BPC supports policies that promote safe, secure, and responsible AI development and deployment while ensuring U.S. leadership in innovation and global competitiveness. We’re encouraged that the Action Plan takes meaningful steps toward these goals, particularly in areas that support public AI literacy, trustworthy systems, access to computing and data resources, and the development of AI evaluation ecosystems. Pillar 1 – Accelerate AI Innovation Enable AI Adoption: Establishes regulatory sandboxes and AI Centers of Excellence for rapid deployment and testing. This could support adoption in sectors like healthcare, where challenges surface around trust and risk, costs and regulation, and lack of clear and accepted governance standards. BPC supports regulatory sandboxes and testbeds to enable safe, real-world piloting of innovative AI. In 2024, BPC also provided more than 600 Congressional staff with training through our AI 101 initiative to increase the AI literacy of Congress. Expect more OMB and agency CIO guidance, and additional support for regulatory sandboxes and Centers of Excellence across federal agencies.

In these blogs, we highlight both strong convergence and areas where continued discussion and policy development are essential to fully realize the promise of AI for all Americans. AI Action Plan and Health Care AI is already impacting health care, research, and innovation, but the industry has been slower than others to adopt it because of challenges with trust, regulation, and system complexity. The Action Plan highlights how AI could accelerate medical research, improve care delivery, and strengthen biosecurity. It calls for creating regulatory sandboxes (controlled environments to safely test approved AI tools) and launching AI Centers of Excellence to evaluate their real-world impact. The plan also recommends: investing in biomedical data and automated research infrastructure to speed drug discovery and precision medicine; improving data sharing and screening processes to strengthen biosecurity; and supporting workforce development and AI standards. These actions build on federal agencies’ existing roles: the National Institutes of Health in biomedical research, Food and Drug Administration in medical product oversight, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in payment and delivery innovation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in standards development to move tools from concept to clinical use safely and efficiently. Ensuring AI adoption protects patients, fosters innovation, and improves affordability will be essential to realizing its full benefits across the health care system. Areas of Alignment in the Action Plan BPC is advancing policies that foster innovation and promote the responsible use of AI in health care. We’re encouraged to see the Action Plan taking steps in areas that align with this focus.  Pillar 1 – Accelerate AI Innovation Invest in AI-Enabled Science: Calls for building high tech automated labs, connected through the cloud, and supporting research teams that use AI to drive major scientific breakthroughs, from engineering and chemistry to biology and neuroscience.

    "content": "In June 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched Elsa, a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool intended to boost productivity and efficiency. Elsa is the FDA’s first internal use of a commercial large language model, but AI use by FDA and other federal agencies is not new. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been using AI tools since 1996, with uptake steadily increasing in recent years. According to a recent report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), HHS has seen the highest recent increase in generative AI use cases and total AI use cases, compared to other federal agencies. Since taking office, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made it clear he wants to see AI put to work, both behind the scenes and in public-facing functions. Growing Federal AI Adoption HHS began tracking and publishing its internal AI use cases in alignment with a 2020 executive order promoting the use of AI in the federal government. The order directed federal agencies to inventory and publicly report non-classified and non-sensitive uses of AI. HHS published its first HHS AI Use Case Inventory in 2022 and has since issued annual updates through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy’s Office of the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer. The inventory outlines how HHS sub-agencies use AI, providing descriptions of each tool’s purpose, safeguards, and alignment with federal guidance. AI use within the federal government surged after the release of generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Between 2022 and 2024 (the most recent data release), the number of AI use cases within HHS nearly quadrupled, reaching 270 cases in 2024 across nine HHS agencies—up from 163 the year before. In April 2025, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued two memoranda on the use of AI within federal agencies. These new directives required agencies to track AI use, designate Chief AI Officers, and revise how they evaluate and adopt new technologies, further reinforcing transparency and modernizing AI governance. Deep Dive by Agency The HHS inventory categorizes each AI use case into six topic areas and provides brief descriptions of each tool’s intended purpose and benefits. The inventory includes checklist-style details on the types of agency-owned data used to develop the model, whether the tool has federal security authorization, and whether information on performance metrics and intended use is available for review and feedback. The inventory also notes whether tools share information with the public or support High-Impact Service Providers, which are federal digital services that could significantly impact people&#8217;s lives if disrupted. For more information on reporting criteria, see the Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council’s Guidance for 2024 Agency AI Reporting. The table below describes the six topic areas and examples of use cases within CDC, CMS, and FDA. &nbsp; 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC primarily uses AI tools to support literature reviews and speed up data cleaning, coding, and analysis for its surveys. It also&hellip;",

The Senate Appropriations Committee followed suit, approving its own funding bill on July 24. The House THUD bill provides approximately $67.8 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for FY2026, $939 million less than HUD’s FY2025 budget, and $5.5 billion less than the $73.3 billion provided by the Senate bill. The House bill achieves this lower funding level by reducing spending on programs like public housing and eliminating appropriations for others, namely the HOME Investment Partnerships Program; however, these changes are not as significant as those included in President Trump&#8217;s budget request released in May. The Senate bill calls for increased funding for most HUD programs and retains the HOME program. While the House bill calls for a substantial drop in funding for HUD agency staff in line with the administration’s proposed personnel reductions, neither the House nor Senate bills include the consolidation and block granting of HUD’s largest rental assistance programs from the president’s budget request. Select program funding details from the House and Senate THUD bills are listed below, as compared to FY2025 enacted funding. A more detailed table, including FY2024 and FY2025 funding levels can be downloaded here.

    "content": "The recent reconciliation package, the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July, extended and expanded provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that otherwise would have expired at the end of 2025, and included additional relief and support for American families. Changes to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) drew interest from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle prior to the final reconciliation package emerged as one of the primary levers to increase support for working families. Now that the reconciliation package has become law, it is important to understand how the CTC changed, how it stacks up against previous expansions, and how the new law will impact families. The Child Tax Credit The new law made the TCJA’s $2,000 per child base credit permanent and increased it to $2,200 per child effective in 2025 (and adjusted for inflation in years after). It also made permanent the phase-out threshold rate of $200,000 ($400,000 for taxpayers married filing jointly) and the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child dependents. The bill also continues to adjust the refundable part of the credit for inflation each year (in 2025, the maximum refundable credit is $1,700 per child). The bill adjusted the eligibility requirements to now require valid Social Security numbers (SSNs) for both the qualifying child and the taxpayer claiming the child (previously, the law only required an SSN for the child). In the case of a joint return, only one parent needs to have an SSN to be eligible to claim the CTC. Table 1 highlights the changes to the CTC in OBBB, and the proposed version in the House reconciliation bill compared to prior laws.

    "content": "On August 15, 2025, the Treasury Department issued updated guidance (Notice 202542)  on how to determine if a wind or solar project has “commenced construction” for purposes of qualifying for 45Y or 48E clean electricity tax credits before the July 4, 2026, deadline. Projects commencing construction after that date also must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for the 45Y or 48E tax credits. The new guidance eliminates the 5% safe harbor (described in detail below) for solar projects larger than 1.5 MW—the physical work test is now the sole method for determining whether a project has commenced construction for purposes of qualifying for the tax credits.  This guidance has an effective date of September 2, 2025, meaning there is a short window during which projects can still qualify for the tax credits using the previously effective guidance. How the federal government defines “commence construction” could make or break the viability of clean energy projects seeking to qualify for the updated 45Y or 48E clean electricity tax credits in H.R. 1. The law’s eligibility windows for credit values are based on when a project commences construction, which, while seemingly obvious at first blush, is not so straightforward. Does one shovelful of dirt trigger the commencement of construction? What if the second shovelful doesn’t happen until a month later? One year later? Three years? What about fencing off the area? Or bringing in temporary administrative buildings? Recent changes to the tax code, as well as an executive order from President Donald Trump that seeks to “ensure that policies concerning ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented,” underscore the necessity for clarity around the term. It is crucial to the buildout of clean energy that developers accurately understand how to comply with the law to utilize these credits. Commence construction in H.R. 1 H.R. 1 (commonly called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act), signed into law on July 4, 2025, made significant changes to the eligibility requirements for the 48E (clean electricity investment) and 45Y (clean electricity production) tax credits for solar and wind projects. These changes base credit eligibility on when a project commences construction and when it is placed into service. The law provides full credit value for wind and solar projects if construction commences within 12 months from enactment (i.e., before July 5, 2026). If a wind or solar facility begins construction after the 12-month window, it must be placed into service before December 31, 2027, to receive the credit. This can be a challenge given long timelines for projects to interconnect with the grid. For other clean energy technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear, projects must commence construction before 2034 to get the full credit value of 45Y or 48E before the credit begins to phase out. Current definition The question of what constitutes commence construction for purposes of the 45Y and 48E tax credits is not new. The Treasury Department addressed this question through guidance (Notice 2013-29) in 2013 by establishing two methods to demonstrate that&hellip;",

    "content": "Update: In August 2025, Social Security’s chief actuary reported that the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which was signed by the president on July 4, 2025, will advance trust fund depletion to 2032. The 2025 report of the trustees of the Social Security trust funds underscores the financial precarity of the nation’s most popular federal program. The trustees project that Social Security’s primary trust fund will be depleted in 2033. Unless Congress acts, current and future beneficiaries alike will see their benefits cut by 23%. The trustees’ projected depletion date did not change between 2024 and 2025, despite the enactment of the Social Security Fairness Act at the beginning of this year. That legislation, which eliminated Social Security’s Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset, is projected to add nearly $200 billion to the program’s shortfall over the next 10 years alone. Figure 1: Social Security Benefit Cliff Projected in 2033 Policymakers from both parties have known for decades that Social Security’s finances are unsustainable but have consistently failed to act, leaving the program an estimated $25 trillion short over the next 75 years—a gap between projected inflows and benefit payments that continues to grow. This inaction threatens the financial security of millions of Americans who rely on Social Security payments and causes massive uncertainty for millions more who are trying to plan for retirement. Strengthening Social Security’s finances is far from impossible; rather, it’s a policy choice that requires political leadership. Congress last reformed the program—addressing its then-looming insolvency in the process—more than 40 years ago. Prior to that, lawmakers regularly updated the program’s tax rates, tax base, benefit amounts, and other policy parameters. Instead of leaving on autopilot the most effective anti-poverty program in U.S. history, Congress must return to more active stewardship of Social Security and take steps to address the impact of rapidly changing national demographics. A Program Designed for the Past Social Security benefits are funded by payroll tax revenues in combination with trust fund reserves that were built up over many years of annual surpluses. (The program is now expected to run deficits permanently.) But the aging U.S. population has placed an unprecedented burden on a workforce that is growing more slowly. In 1960, there were more than five workers paying Social Security taxes per beneficiary, but that ratio has dropped to just three-to-one in 2024 and is projected to decline to less than 2.5-to-one by the middle of the century. One major reason: “Peak 65,” the period from 2024 to 2027 in which more than 4.1 million Americans are turning 65 each year, the largest surge of retirements in our nation’s history. Figure 2: The Long Decline of the Worker-to-Beneficiary Ratio This many Americans entering retirement is not the only stressor on the system. Compounding the financial shortfall is how long those retirees are living. The life expectancy of a 65-year-old has increased by 50% since 1940 (shortly after Social Security was created), and SSA projects that trend will continue unabated. With historic&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 10, 2025, MP Materials announced a “transformational public-private partnership” with the Department of Defense (DOD) to shore up U.S. supplies of rare earth elements (REEs). While DOD and other federal agencies have supported critical minerals in the past through loans and grants, the MP Materials deal marks the first time the federal government has become a major shareholder in a critical minerals company. DOD officials say this will be the first of many critical mineral investments so it is important to understand what the agreement entails. Why does the federal government need to be involved in critical minerals projects? China dominates the critical minerals supply chain. Fifty-seven percent of lithium, 77% of cobalt, 92% of rare earth elements, and 91% of natural graphite processing capacities occur within China’s borders. The United States depends on China as the primary supplier of 24 of the 50 critical minerals listed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Onshoring the supply chain for critical minerals is important for both national and energy security reasons, particularly when it comes to REEs because of their use in energy and defense applications. BPC has been supportive of federal involvement to strengthen our domestic critical mineral supply chains, including our proposal for a Resilient Resource Reserve to kickstart domestic investment in the critical minerals processing sector. Who is MP Materials? MP Materials, headquartered in Las Vegas, operates the only active rare earth mine in the United States—the second largest in the world. The name “MP” comes from the Mountain Pass Mine in California, which the company acquired when it was founded. MP Materials is a vertically integrated company with the capability to mine, process, and then use REEs to manufacture magnets. MP Materials also runs a magnet production factory in Texas. What does the DOD Agreement look like? The agreement between DOD and MP Materials is a multi-billion-dollar package consisting of four main components: $400 million equity investment: DOD has acquired preferred, convertible stock and warrants, making it MP Materials’ largest shareholder with a 15% stake in the company. The proceeds of this investment will be used by MP Materials to expand its existing separation, processing, and magnet production capabilities by building a new “10X” magnet manufacturing facility. The agreement also includes the option for an additional investment of up to $350 million by DOD in the same preferred stock. $150 million loan: The DOD loan is meant to finance an expansion of heavy rare earth separation at the Mountain Pass Mine. The loan is unsecured, meaning MP Materials does not provide any form of collateral and carries an interest rate based on the ten-year treasury bond yield plus 1%. Interest payments are due quarterly, and the loan must be repaid within 12 years. 10-year offtake agreement: DOD has committed to purchasing 100% of the magnets produced at MP Materials’ planned magnet manufacturing facility for 10 years, starting when the facility becomes operational (currently slated for 2028). With DOD’s consent, however, MP Materials may instead sell up&hellip;",

One year later on July 1, 1966, more than 19 million individuals enrolled in Medicare, providing hospital, outpatient, and home health coverage to almost all Americans over the age of 65.  Today, the program covers over 70 million Americans through the program’s original hospital (Part A) and outpatient (Part B) services. Reflecting on how Medicare came about, Robert M. Ball, the principal planner and first administrator of Medicare, observed that the guiding hand of pragmatism dictated the outline of the program: “What we could get Congress to agree to and in administration what would work.” ￼ The result was a compromise that preserved eligibility only for the elderly, consisting of two parts. Part A (hospital) benefits were based on the Blue Cross system available to the privately insured, and Part B (physician) benefits were based on an Aetna policy offered to federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Programs (FEHB). Indeed, Ball and others advocated for something more than what Congress was able to pass. For many proponents of the 1965 law, the legislation was to be the entering wedge for universal health care. Despite major changes to the original program over its 60-year history, that goal of universal coverage remains elusive but unceasing for many progressives. Those changes have included expansion of benefits to individuals under the age of 65 with long-term disabilities and to individuals with end-stage renal diseases in 1972; the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997; Medicare Part C in 1982, later rebranded as Medicare Advantage (MA) private health plans; and Medicare Part D in 2003, establishing an optional prescription drug benefit. Congress also enacted major changes and insurance reforms in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, including expanded Medicare and drug and preventive services. But the basic structure of the 1965 law remains essentially unchanged, and advocates for expanded and catastrophic benefits continue to argue for universal coverage. The end result, Medicare, while a popular program, remains confusing for many and complex to administer. It also has become a very costly program. Along with Medicaid, CHIP and premium tax credits, federal health care expenditures will reach $2 trillion this year and represent a third of all non-interest federal outlays. With an aging population, driven by elderly baby-boomers expected to live well into their 80s and 90s, along with dramatic scientific advances in diagnosis and treatment, growth in Medicare alone is forecast to exceed 7 percent annually—well in excess of projected economic growth. A major contributor to this growth has been the shift from traditional fee-for-service Medicare (TM) to managed care in the private sector, Medicare Advantage (MA).  Today, MA beneficiaries represent more than 50 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries, and this share is expected to continue to increase over the next decade. When MA was first established in the 1980s, concerns over the rising cost of Medicare accelerated the assumption that market competition would&hellip;",

    "content": "For families who receive federal housing assistance, rental payments typically increase proportional to income—meaning the more a household earns, the more it pays in rent. This dynamic contributes to a common critique of federal rental assistance: it may discourage assisted households from earning more, as additional income could trigger rent increases or the loss of assistance altogether. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program aims to address this concern through a combination of case management and targeted financial incentives that are designed to increase the earnings and savings of participating families, promote employment, and ultimately reduce reliance on federal assistance. In recent years, there has been bipartisan interest in reforming FSS to expand participation and maximize its impact. This explainer outlines how the program works and reviews proposals to broaden its reach. How the FSS Program Works Congress authorized FSS in 1990 as part of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, with overwhelming bipartisan support. The program was initially limited to public housing agencies (PHAs) but later expanded to include multifamily property owners with Section 8 Project Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) contracts. Eligible families include participants in the Housing Choice Voucher program, public housing tenants, and households in the PBRA program. Participation is voluntary for both PHAs and property owners, as well as for eligible HUD-assisted families. As of 2025, about 700 PHAs and property owners administer FSS programs, serving approximately 74,000 families, a fraction of the millions of eligible households. To enroll, an interested family enters a contract of participation with its administrator (either the PHA or property owner), generally for a five- to seven-year term. The participating household member works with an FSS coordinator to establish targeted, achievable employment and financial goals. The coordinator compiles these goals and outlines necessary steps to complete them in an Individual Training and Services Plan (ITSP), which is included in the contract. Once the ITSP is established, participating families benefit from two key program features: case management and an escrow savings account. Case Management Based on its ISTP, the family is connected to a range of services through an FSS coordinator. Services may include child care, transportation, substance use treatment, education, household budgeting, or financial literacy counseling. All services are intended to help the family overcome obstacles to achieve economic stability. Escrow Savings Account HUD-assisted families typically pay 30% of their adjusted income toward rent. If a family&#8217;s income increases, its rent payment is adjusted to reflect a greater ability to pay. Under FSS, any rent increase due to higher earnings—calculated from the start of the program participation—is deposited into an interest-bearing escrow account by the administrator. When the family reaches the end of its contract and graduates—meaning the signatory is employed, no family member receives welfare assistance, and all individual goals are met—the family receives the full balance of the escrow account.1 These funds can then be used to support other personal and financial goals, like returning to school or buying a home.

    "content": "At $29 trillion and counting, U.S. publicly held debt has reached deeply concerning levels. Interest on the debt alone is now running at nearly $1 trillion annually—eating up close to one out of every five dollars collected in taxes—and Treasury yields, the price demanded by bond investors to buy our debt, are as high as they have been at any point since before the financial crisis in 2008.   Meanwhile, although major economic indicators have been relatively steady, policy uncertainty—most notably around tariffs—leaves questions about the road ahead. If the economy were to take a turn for the worse, how much of an impact would it have on the deficit?   Economists define recessions as a significant decline in economic activity lasting at least two consecutive quarters. Recessions hammer the federal budget from both sides, reducing tax revenues due to declining economic activity while increasing spending on safety net programs, with the amounts depending on the type and magnitude of the shock. The rest of this blog dives into how prior recessions have impacted the federal deficit.  Automatic Stabilizers Dampen Recessions but Add to the Deficit  Certain government programs fluctuate based on public need rather than spending a fixed amount annually. These programs, such as unemployment insurance (UI), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Medicaid, are considered “automatic stabilizers” because they pump money into the economy when times are hard without any congressional or administrative action. Automatic stabilizers both support eligible Americans whose employment or income has been affected and prop up demand. Uncapped funding for programs that serve as automatic stabilizers means that recessions almost always lead to higher government expenditure.   Progressive taxes, such as the individual income tax, also function as automatic stabilizers during recessions, reducing the amount they extract from the economy as some taxpayers are pushed into lower tax brackets. This impact can be seen in federal tax receipts, which consistently decline during economic downturns. Together, these different forms of automatic stabilizers play a key role in alleviating the effects of a recession.   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that automatic stabilizers increased the deficit by 20% (or 1.6% of gross domestic product) in 2009 and 33% (or 2.1% of GDP) in 2010 following the Great Recession. The relative impact of automatic stabilizers on the deficit was less drastic in the COVID-19 recession—10% (or 1.2% of GDP) and 7% (or 0.8% of GDP) in 2020 and 2021, respectively—due both to the greater size of the deficit at the time and newly legislated fiscal stimulus playing a larger role. Automatic stabilizers often contribute significantly to deficits for several years after the recession itself.  Stimulus Packages Cost Even More  Automatic stabilizers are not the only source of deficit impacts around a recession. Congress often plays an important role in jumpstarting the economy by passing emergency stimulus packages—which are typically unpaid for.  Further adding to the nation’s debt pushes up yields on U.S. Treasury securities—which in turn increases interest rates across the economy and diminishes the positive impact of stimulus&hellip;",

    "content": "For most working families, child care is an essential expense. However, the rising costs have made it less accessible and affordable for many parents. In response, policymakers have taken steps to strengthen the tools available to support working families. Recently, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) was enhanced through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, expanding support to help families better manage the rising costs of care. The CDCTC remains the only tax credit designed to help families offset a portion of eligible child and dependent care-related expenses while they work or look for work. Changes to the CDCTC The CDCTC was first created in 1976 as a tax deduction and later changed to a non-refundable tax credit for families with children. Enhancements to CDCTC have enjoyed bicameral, bipartisan support in recent years with several proposals introduced. The 2025 reconciliation bill meaningfully changed the credit by increasing its value for many families. Prior to this enhancement, the underlying credit effectively remained unchanged since a 2001 expansion (which was made permanent in 2012). The credit was temporarily expanded in 2021 for one year only to help families weather the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table highlights changes to the CDCTC in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. One Big Beautiful Bill Act (effective January 1, 2026) Prior Law Maximum Qualifying Expenses $3,000 (one child) / $6,000 (two or more children) $3,000 (one child) / $6,000 (two or more children) Credit Rate 50% for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) between $0 and $15,000; 35% to 50% for taxpayers with AGI between $15,000 and $43,000a; 35% for taxpayers with AGI between $43,001 and $75,000; 20% to 35% for taxpayers with AGI between $75,001 and $105,000 ($150,001 and $210,000 for joint filers) 20% for taxpayers with AGI over $105,000 ($210,000 for joint filers) 35% for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) between $0 and $15,000; 20% to 35% for taxpayers with AGI between $15,000 and $43,000a; 20% for taxpayers with AGI over $43,000 Refundability Non-refundable Non-refundable Income Phase-out No income phase-out No income phase-out DCAP Provisions Limit of $7,500 ($3,750 for married filing individually) tax-free contributions per year Limit of $5,000 ($2,500 for married filing individually) tax-free contributions per year a. For taxpayers with AGI over $15,000, the credit rate decreases by 1% for approximately every $2,000 of increased income up to $43,000.

    "content": "This explainer was prepared with research assistance from Merica Griffin.  Federal student loans for 2025-26 began disbursal this month. New borrowers continue seeing elevated interest rates, as they are directly tied to the 10-year Treasury note yield, which has risen sharply in recent years—in part due to concerns about the U.S.’s fiscal trajectory.   This does not just increase the debt burden of new borrowers but may also delay their wealth building in the future.  Rising Treasury Yields  Although the rise in interest rates since 2020 was initially connected to the Federal Reserve’s efforts to fight post-pandemic inflation, longer-term Treasury yields continued to rise even as the Fed started cutting its benchmark federal funds rate in 2024. For example, the average yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit its highest level in 17 years in 2024. This trend in part reflects concerns about America’s worsening fiscal trajectory, as well as broader economic uncertainty.  In fact, the yield continued to increase beyond expectations in early 2025. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the average 10-year note rate is 0.1 percentage points higher than projected over the next decade, it would increase net interest outlays on the national debt by $355 billion during that time period. In addition to crowding out other budget priorities, rising Treasury yields directly impact the pocketbooks of American households, as they influence various borrowing costs in the economy.  If the federal deficit continues to increase in the coming years, Treasury yields are likely to rise as well, thus straining Americans’ household budgets.   Impact on Student Borrowing Costs  One such household cost impacted by rising Treasury yields is federal student loan rates. Nearly 43 million Americans, or about one in six adults, collectively hold federal student debt totaling $1.6 trillion. Interest rates for federal student loans are tied each year to the yield of the 10-year Treasury note from the last Treasury auction held before June 1.   Treasury auction yields are determined through a competitive bidding process in which investors submit bids for securities. Those bids are then accepted by the Treasury Department at a rate that clears the auction. Student loan rates equal this auction yield plus a fixed add-on percentage depending on the loan type. The add-on percentage is 2.05% for undergraduate loans, 3.60% for graduate loans, and 4.60% for PLUS loans (which are available to borrowers for graduate and professional programs not covered by other loans and parents of dependent undergraduates).    The soaring 10-year note yields since 2020 have sharply increased costs for new student borrowers. Although rates in 2020 were unusually low due to the pandemic and the Fed’s response, they have since increased far beyond pre-pandemic levels. The 2024 rate was the highest since student loan rates were tied to Treasury yields in 2013. In fact, it was the highest rate since 2008. The rates in 2025 decreased slightly, but remain at elevated levels, increasing the debt burden for millions of new student borrowers.  &nbsp; A look at the typical loan demonstrates&hellip;",

    "content": "With an acute national shortage of affordable homes, we must closely examine the complex regulatory landscape that too often adds cost to, and slows, the production and preservation of housing. Because there is a bipartisan consensus that we need to increase the supply of affordable rentals and starter homes, reforming regulations that unduly hinder housing construction and preservation is critical. The cost of regulatory compliance can account for nearly 25% of the price of a typical newly-built, single-family home and an average of more than 40% for a multifamily housing development. These costs stem from a wide range of policies and processes—including navigating zoning and land use requirements, securing permits, adhering to building codes, and reviewing potential environmental impacts—formulated at all levels of government. Given the severity of the nation’s housing supply shortage and continued high housing costs, federal policymakers should encourage state and local reviews of unnecessary and excessively cumbersome regulations while also assessing and redressing federal laws and policies that unduly impede housing production and preservation. The six targeted deregulatory proposals outlined below, which would require either administrative or legislative action, could help ease the housing affordability crisis by increasing the supply of homes and preserving the existing affordable housing stock. Deregulatory Proposals to Increase the Supply of Affordable Housing Categorically exclude infill housing from the National Environmental Policy Act The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the potential environmental impacts of proposed actions, a standard that can apply to housing developments receiving federal assistance. Complying with NEPA and related federal laws can be complicated and time-intensive, delaying the development of new projects and increasing their costs. Federal agencies can designate certain actions as categorical exclusions under NEPA, excluding these actions from more stringent review—such as an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement—because they do not have a significant environmental impact. Currently, there is no categorical exclusion for infill housing, generally referring to developments built on vacant or underused land in existing urban areas. Consequently, a federally-assisted housing development on a parcel in a populated, well-developed area may still trigger an environmental review. California recently exempted most urban infill housing from review under its statewide environmental quality act, reflecting a growing interest in a deregulatory approach to harnessing the full potential of infill housing. The Trump administration has prioritized modernizing and accelerating permitting, rescinding the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations and directing agencies to update their implementation rules. Several agencies have completed these updates, but HUD has not finalized its regulations. Directing HUD and other housing-focused federal agencies to make infill housing a categorical exclusion could reduce unnecessary delays and costs for infill developments receiving federal assistance, while aligning with the Trump administration’s broader deregulatory push. Amend the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act to allow better-quality manufactured housing HUD currently requires manufactured homes to be built on a permanent chassis, which allows these homes to be transported. While a permanent chassis can be a useful option, many manufactured homes are&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 4, President Trump signed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) into law, marking the end of a months-long reconciliation process. While the Bipartisan Policy Center prefers regular order over the partisan reconciliation process to pass major legislation, the law includes critical policy wins for working families. These policies have longstanding bipartisan support and are the result of years-long bipartisan efforts to advance solutions on child care, paid family leave, and economic supports for American families and children. The result is a landmark demonstration of bipartisan cooperation to strengthen the tax code and pass policy solutions for working families, particularly on child care and paid family leave. The OBBB features five major wins aligned with BPC’s long-standing recommendations in this space: Increased Child Tax Credit (CTC) Enhanced Child and Dependent Tax Credit (CDCTC) Increased Dependent Care Assistance Programs (DCAPs) Enhanced Employer-Provided Child Care Credit (45F) Enhanced and made permanent Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave (45S) For more information on what changes were made to these provisions in OBBB, see BPC’s explainer on tax provisions for working families. Building Bipartisan Champions for Working Families The pandemic underscored how the lack of caregiving support for working families can strain household stability, reduce workforce participation, and hinder economic growth, highlighting the need for pro-family policies that help parents stay employed and businesses remain competitive. The scheduled expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) at the end of 2025 offered an opportunity for Congress to address this, and to modernize and strengthen the tax code for working families. Child Tax Credit The CTC has enjoyed strong bipartisan support, with recent temporary expansions in TCJA and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) to enhance the credit and provide increased financial support to most families. Most notably, in early 2024, then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) released a bipartisan proposal in the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act aimed at ensuring the CTC remained at $2,000 or more and would not revert back to $1,000 at the end of 2025. That bill eventually failed in the Senate, but it demonstrated bipartisan support for permanently enhancing the CTC. Despite initial differences between the House and Senate on the length and amount of the CTC, the final OBBB permanently extended the current $2,000 CTC, increased it to $2,200 per child in 2025, and annually adjusts the credit for inflation moving forward. Child Care Three main tax provisions—the CDCTC, DCAPs, and 45F credit—help families offset the costs of child and dependent care or employers offset the costs of providing child care supports to their workers. Enhancements to these provisions were omitted in TCJA, and while temporarily expanded in 2021 through ARPA, they had not been meaningfully changed in over a decade. Throughout the 118th and 119th sessions of Congress, championed by a diverse group of stakeholders from across the political spectrum, members introduced multiple proposals to&hellip;",

    "content": "While drafting H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, congressional Republicans and the administration wrestled with concerns about policies that would reduce federal spending on health care, with particular attention on changes to Medicaid provider taxes and their impacts on rural hospitals. The final package incrementally lowers the allowable state provider tax rates in Medicaid expansion states, starting in FY 2027. These changes are expected to reduce federal Medicaid payments over time, with particularly significant effects in rural areas, where more than 16 million Medicaid beneficiaries live. Estimates suggest that these and other provisions could reduce federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years. In addition to the direct effects on Medicaid beneficiaries, these changes could produce ripple effects for rural hospitals that would affect other rural health care consumers. To help counter these concerns, Congress appropriated $50 billion for a Rural Health Transformation Program. The program allocates $10 billion per year across all the states starting in FY 2026 through FY 2030. 50% of those payments will be distributed equally across states with approved applications, while the remaining half will be distributed by the CMS administrator based on a state’s rural population and need. This program will fund states to cover a wide range of activities, including: Payments to health care providers Recruitment and workforce training Purchasing new technologies Supporting access to opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services Promoting evidence-based interventions to improve preventive care and chronic disease management BPC has long worked to develop policies to support the approximately 60 million people in the United States—20% of the population—who live in rural communities and rely on rural hospitals for their health care. Many of these hospitals operate on thin margins and face mounting financial pressures. Informed by conversations with hospitals, state leaders, and policymakers from both parties, this blog highlights potential priorities for using the new Rural Health Transformation Program and additional steps Congress could take to help rural hospitals serve their communities. Ensuring Access to Essential Rural Services States could use funds to help rural hospitals maintain essential services like emergency room care, labor and delivery services, and behavioral health care. For rural hospitals, fixed costs associated with maintaining essential services cause financial strain. These costs are often related to maintaining a minimum level of staffing and essential equipment to deliver time-sensitive services, regardless of patient volume. Rural hospitals must absorb this standby capacity, even if their patient volume and related revenue are not high enough to cover the expenditures. When hospitals cannot absorb these expenses, they are often forced to reduce services or close entirely. For example, high fixed costs have contributed to a decline in rural maternal care. Between 2012 and 2022, approximately one quarter of all rural hospitals stopped providing obstetric services, affecting access to maternal care in 267 communities. More information on additional payment structures for rural hospitals can be found in our report Sustaining Rural Hospital Access: Adjustments to Medicare Rural Hospital Designations.

    "content": "Today’s college students often face significant financial barriers and many struggle with meeting their basic needs. Students contending with unmet financial need are highly vulnerable to emergency expenses like a car repair, change in childcare arrangements, or medical issue, that can derail their education and cause them to stop out of college—preventing them from receiving the earnings boost associated with holding a degree and leaving them more vulnerable to eventually defaulting on their student loans. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 19% of undergraduates in 2020 reported that they would have trouble finding $500 to meet an unexpected expense. In the past decade, many institutions of higher education have responded to this challenge by creating emergency aid programs to help students overcome unexpected costs and remain on the path to graduation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) dramatically expanded the availability of emergency aid to respond to the unique impacts of the pandemic. Last year, BPC published an explainer on the effectiveness of emergency aid in student retention and completion. Recent studies provide mixed evidence on the effect of emergency aid on student outcomes. Nevertheless, they show promising indications of its potential and indicate that program design may play a major role in determining its effectiveness. In February, BPC hosted a virtual roundtable with representatives from state and institutional emergency aid programs to learn more about how colleges and universities can maximize the impact of these interventions. This blog highlights lessons from the roundtable and from additional conversations with researchers and emergency aid administrators about the role of emergency aid in supporting student success. The Emergency Aid Landscape Surveys show that many institutions have implemented emergency aid programs that provide small grants, generally less than $1,000 and often much smaller, to help students experiencing financial shocks. These programs vary in eligibility criteria, goals, and application processes, as well as in how they define what constitutes a qualified use. Emergency aid programs commonly focus on providing grants to students facing unexpected, non-tuition expenses. Other programs (like Georgia State University’s Panther Retention Grant) focus on students close to graduating but at risk of stopping out due to financial difficulties, including challenges with unpaid tuition balances. Institutions usually draw on their own resources and donations to fund emergency aid programs. Several states, including Washington, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have established dedicated funding streams for emergency aid. Philanthropic efforts have also helped expand emergency aid availability. In Texas, for example, the Greater Texas Foundation has invested $1.5 million over three years to help community colleges establish or strengthen emergency aid programs and partnered with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and Trellis Foundation to provide institutions with approximately $1.25 million in grants for emergency aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the Evidence on Emergency Aid Emergency aid programs address a widely-recognized challenge to student success; however, evidence for the effectiveness of emergency aid programs in supporting retention and completion is mixed.

    "content": "Earlier this year, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Human Capital Program launched the Commission on the American Workforce, bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders to craft a bipartisan blueprint to address the nation’s growing education and workforce challenges. The resulting recommendations will focus on ensuring every American has access to economic opportunity, building a workforce for the future, and nurturing the talent necessary to remain a global leader. In April, Sens. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Deb Fischer (R-NE) joined BPC and commission working group members for a private discussion about congressional priorities for working families and insights into the ongoing reconciliation debates. Importantly, they identified three challenges facing American nationwide: childcare, housing, and the workforce needs. The discussion reaffirmed that these human capital issues are kitchen-table topics that impact nearly every American and require strong bipartisan leadership to find solutions. 2025 Reconciliation Debate The working group’s discussion highlighted two critical bipartisan legislative efforts underway for working families: the Child Care Availability and Affordability Act, led by Sens. Kaine and Katie Britt (R-AL) and the Paid Family and Medical Leave Tax Credit Extension and Enhancement Act, led by Sens. Fischer and Angus King (I-ME). H.R.1., the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, includes enhancements to employer credits for child care (45F) and paid family and medical leave (45S). The reconciliation process has leveraged the bipartisan ideas from these two bills which BPC endorsed and continues to support in conjunction with the Commission. Check out the latest reconciliation updates from BPC here. The Postsecondary Pathways Working Group held their April meeting at the ASU+GSV Summit in San Diego, where they were able to leverage the expertise of education and workforce leaders to enrich the discussion. The conference explored how scaled innovations in education and workforce development can create a future of opportunity for American students, workers, and families. Several commissioners—Russlynn Ali, Katie Jenner, Harrison Keller, John B. King, Jamie Merisotis, and Eloy Ortiz Oakley—and working group members—Alison Griffin, Shalin Jyotishi, Rosemary Lahasky, Christian Osmeña, Tim Renick, Matt Sigelman, Steve Taylor, and Jason Tyszko—participated in panel discussions on a future ready workforce, student success, human capital development, and pathways for opportunity issues aligned with the commission’s policy interests. The spring working group meetings expanded upon themes from the winter meetings, with an emphasis on refining the role of the federal government in early childhood, paid leave, K-12 education, postsecondary education, and workforce policy. These discussions made clear that there is no “one-size-fits-all&#8221; solution to issues in education and the workforce, but there are important areas on which the federal government can lead. As the Commission develops durable solutions, three priorities emerged that can guide federal action. Prioritizing Support and Advancing Opportunity The federal government has historically played a role in providing additional supports to some classes of students, workers, and employers to help them participate to their fullest potential in the education system, labor market, and civic life.

    "content": "On July 3, Congress passed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). President Trump signed OBBB into law on July 4. Lawmakers included several tax code changes in H.R. 1 meant to encourage investment in U.S. manufacturing, including faster depreciation deductions for production facilities. Accelerated deductions for production facilities are a new approach to incentivizing domestic manufacturing investment. What is a depreciation deduction? Depreciation is a tax deduction that allows companies to recoup certain costs of doing business, particularly investments that pay off over time. Depreciation can cover a wide range of investments, from property to equipment to research and development. Often, depreciation rules follow schedules that dictate how and when a business can deduct an expense from their tax bill. Schedules range from full and immediate expensing (i.e., 100% in the first year of investment) to a 50-year depreciation schedule. Depreciation encourages companies to invest in assets and capital by lowering their tax liability and reducing the cost of those investments over time. Depreciation schedules impact how companies choose to invest in equipment or develop new structures. Depreciation is for assets that generate income. The “matching principle” says that, for accounting purposes, companies should match the costs of assets over their useful life to the revenue generated by the asset. Production facilities are costly, and they remain productive for much longer than other capital investments, so they face longer depreciation schedules of 39 years. Some policymakers argue that depreciation schedules tax businesses on income they don’t yet have by denying a full deduction in the year of investment. Economic research suggests that immediate depreciation has the largest incentive when assets have long lifespans. A review of early 2000s tax laws permitting 50% immediate depreciation found that while spending increased in the targeted investments, the aggregate economic effects were likely modest. Expensing for structures is a new approach, and a full expensing allowance may have different investment effects than previous changes to bonus depreciation. How does H.R. 1 change depreciation rules? H.R. 1 extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s (TCJA) original 100% bonus depreciation (i.e., full and immediate expensing) for investments in machinery and equipment and restores full expensing for business R&amp;D (reversing TCJA’s 2022 switch from full expensing to five-year amortization). H.R. 1 also adds temporary full and immediate expensing for certain production facilities involved in manufacturing. The law backdates the production facilities deduction to cover any construction that began on January 19, 2025 or later. A facility must meet several requirements to qualify, including: Be integral to a “qualified production activity” (see definition below) Be located in the U.S. or its territories Be placed into service (i.e., not still in construction) before January 1, 2031 (two-year grace period for construction effected by acts of god). Not have been used for any production activity from 2021 through May 12, 2025 The depreciation allowance is set at 100% until January 1, 2029, after which manufacturing facilities would revert to their original depreciation schedule of 39 years.&hellip;",

    "content": "New public opinion research from the Bipartisan Policy Center and Cygnal challenges some common assumptions about voter priorities and suggests there is a meaningful, bipartisan opportunity for federal and state lawmakers to work together on child care. This issue, despite recent polarization, still resonates strongly with voters across party lines as a growing number of American parents struggle to find access to quality, affordable child care. While child care has traditionally been viewed as a Democratic policy priority, new research reveals a significant shift in public sentiment that challenges this long-standing perception. The results of new BPC and Cygnal polling show that child care is no longer a niche or partisan concern but is increasingly seen as a mainstream economic and workforce issue. In fact, support for a government role in addressing child care challenges has grown meaningfully among Republican primary voters between 2024 and 2025. This new polling exploring the views of Republican primary voters found that access to child care is seen as a significant challenge, and these voters want elected officials to make this issue a priority. In fact, three-quarters of likely Republican primary voters view child care as a serious problem for American families. This concern is especially pronounced among parents (86%) and business owners (85%). These findings reflect a broader shift in public opinion that is reshaping how child care is viewed across the political spectrum. A national poll from First Five Years Fund shows broad alignment across the political spectrum with 89% of all voters stating they want candidates who have a clear plan to make child care affordable and high-quality. This includes 80% of Republicans, 88% of Independents, and 95% of Democrats. 5 Key Takeaways from Republican Primary Voters, Parents, &amp; Business Several important takeaways emerged from this poll: Republican Voters Take the Child Care Crisis Seriously More than 3 in 4 (76%) say finding affordable, reliable child care is a serious challenge, including almost half who believe it’s an “extremely” or “very” serious challenge. This concern is even higher among parents (86%) and business owners (85%). Nearly three-quarters (72%) want Congress to reduce the financial burden of child care — 84% of business owners and 83% of parents agree. Parents and Employers are Sounding the Alarm 72% of business owners and 75% of parents report turning down jobs, promotions, or reducing work hours due to child care gaps. Respondents under 65 (57%) are more than twice as likely as older voters (24%) to say they or someone they know faced career impacts from child care challenges. Child Care is an Economic Issue 69% say parents use child care to enable full-time work — 65% of business owners and parents agree. 63% believe affordable, reliable care is essential for businesses to attract and retain workers (76% of business owners, 78% of parents). 64% worry shortages will hamper hiring and retention (80% of business owners, 83% of parents). 38% expect job losses in their community due to care shortages in coming years.

    "content": "“We have never adopted any innovation as quickly as we have AI tools.” This sentiment echoed across a recent discussion with experts on artificial intelligence in health care. This June, BPC and the Commonwealth Fund convened leading researchers, practitioners, payers, policy experts, and congressional staff to discuss how AI can improve administrative efficiency. Below is a summary of the major themes raised in that conversation. AI Adoption in Health Care Settings As ChatGPT exploded onto the scene over the last couple of years, so has AI usage in medical settings. Many dinner participants agreed that this rapid change has left the health care system scrambling to figure out how to best use these new technologies. Half of all U.S. hospitals use AI to facilitate patient scheduling, and 36% use it for billing. While these administrative uses can increase efficiency, one attendee asked if AI was really helping improve our health system or just automating “the old way of doing things.” Participants discussed two main categories of AI use in health care: administrative tools and clinician-facing tools. One clinician spoke of using ambient listening tools to help with charting and patient notes. Another noted that AI can help summarize long patient histories so that providers can spend more time talking with their patients and less time reading their history. There was palpable excitement from providers talking about how use of these tools could help them practice at the top of their licenses. For more information on how AI is used in administrative settings, see BPC’s fact sheet. Benefits and Challenges for Patients and Medical Professionals Attendees also spoke of the benefits patients may gain from using AI tools. For example, chatbots can help patients decipher complex bloodwork panels before they talk with their doctors. It can also help patients summarize their own history before meeting with a new clinician. One speaker noted: “Doctors need to pull in AI (to their practice) otherwise they will be bypassed (by patients using it).” These solutions may empower patients to be more involved in their care and level the relationship between clinicians and patients, but attendees discussed the need for guardrails to make sure that the medical advice patients receive and act on is still guided by medical professionals. Building trust in AI remains a major challenge. While providers increasingly use AI for administrative tasks, such as documentation and translation, patients report being less comfortable with these uses. This is especially true when it comes to tools that predict billing or appointment behavior, due to concerns about data breaches and privacy. This mismatch between how health systems are deploying AI and what patients feel comfortable with highlights a growing trust gap. In a conversation last year, experts also emphasized the need for transparency and trust in AI algorithms. Several experts at the dinner this year discussed their company’s work to expand their use of AI technologies and engage patients through outreach and education. However, more work is needed, especially to reach underserved and rural communities,&hellip;",

    "content": "President Trump signed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, into law on July 4, 2025. The law does not include the House’s proposed three percentage-point increase to the pass-through deduction. It does make permanent the 20% pass-through deduction amount—previously scheduled to expire at the end of this year—and adds a new minimum deduction. See details on the Senate version of OBBB below under: “How do the House and Senate versions of OBBB change the pass-through deduction?”  Congress is currently debating major tax legislation that extends expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and includes new tax cuts. Lawmakers have an opportunity to improve the bill’s budgetary impact by reconsidering a modification made in the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB): the three percentage-point increase in the Section 199A pass-through deduction. Rejecting this increase could reduce the cost of the House bill by around $100 billion over the next decade as congressional Republicans eye ways to reduce the bill’s budget impact while preserving what proponents say is the central purpose of the deduction—to provide “parity” between C corporations and pass-through businesses. What is the pass-through deduction? The pass-through deduction—also called Sec. 199A for its section in the Internal Revenue Code—is a 20% deduction on qualified business income (QBI) for owners of “pass-through” businesses. A pass-through business is one where the business passes its profits through to the individual owners, who then pay income taxes on their individual tax returns. Pass throughs range from small independent contractors with no employees to the very largest privately held businesses, with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers. S corporations, business partnerships, sole proprietorships, and limited liability companies (LLCs) are all types of pass-throughs. Unlike pass-through businesses, C corporations pay tax at the entity level and the shareholder (or owner) level. While most of the nation’s largest companies are C corporations, the majority of all U.S. businesses are pass-throughs. Under current law, the pass-through deduction is subject to several restrictions for taxpayers making above $197,300 in 2025 (or $394,600 for married couples). Those restrictions are based on the type of business and the owner’s share of wages paid and capital assets held by the business. Read more about the pass-through deduction here. How do the House and Senate versions of OBBB change the pass-through deduction? The House version of OBBB proposes to modify the pass-through deduction in several ways by: Making Sec. 199A—currently scheduled to expire Dec. 31, 2025—permanent Raising the deduction amount from 20% of QBI to 23% Making a new type of business income—business development corporation income—eligible for the deduction Modifying the phase-out and inflation adjustment rules Read more on the tax policy changes proposed in the House version of OBBB here. The Senate version of OBBB makes Sec. 199A permanent, but at the 20% rate currently in effect. The Senate bill does not increase the deduction to 23%, but it does provide a new minimum deduction of $400 for taxpayers with business&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress is currently crafting its fiscal year 2026 budget, which will set funding levels for programs that impact the lives of roughly 44 million Americans with disabilities, including the protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) system. The congressionally created P&amp;A system is a network of nonprofit organizations that serve as resources to states working to provide services to Americans with disabilities. It helps ensure federal disability programs function efficiently and in compliance with federal law. The goal of the system is to enable Americans with disabilities to fully participate in their communities, including through productive employment and civic engagement. Here, we break down two core areas of the P&amp;A system: long-term care and voting accessibility. What is the Protection and Advocacy System? Congress established the P&amp;A system in 1975 through the renewal of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. Today, there are 57 P&amp;A organizations—one in each state, territory, and DC, and one serving the Native American population. P&amp;As engage in a variety of activities including investigating abuse and providing legal representation, helping individuals access benefits and assistive technology, and removing barriers to employment and voting. The creation of the P&amp;A system paved the way for a broader shift towards providing services for individuals with disabilities in the community. P&amp;As continue to support states transitioning people with disabilities out of institutional settings and into communities, where they can enter the workforce and gain more financial independence. As states reform (often antiquated) programs serving individuals with disabilities, this technical assistance is essential to ensure their programs and services operate effectively, reduce costs, and are aligned with the needs of people with disabilities.  “The creation of the P&amp;A system paved the way for a broader shift towards providing services for individuals with disabilities in the community. P&amp;As continue to support states transitioning people with disabilities out of institutional settings and into communities, where they can enter the workforce and gain more financial independence.” Congress created eight grant programs that direct P&amp;As to undertake different activities to protect and advocate for Americans with disabilities. The programs cover areas including developmental disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, assistive technology, and voting accessibility. P&amp;As receive federal grant funding for each program. Agencies at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Education, and the Social Security Administration are responsible for delivering congressionally appropriated grant funds to P&amp;As. As Congress sets its priorities for the next fiscal year, we highlight how some of the P&amp;As’ work impacts community living and voting accessibility. How Do P&amp;A Agencies Strengthen Community Living and Workforce Participation? P&amp;As’ goal is to ensure people with disabilities can make informed decisions, protect their rights, and live independently in their communities. Agencies help individuals navigate the complex long-term care system, which offers a broad range of services designed to assist with daily activities, such as eating or bathing. These services have typically been delivered in institutional settings such as nursing homes and, increasingly, community settings. P&amp;As equip individuals with information and connect&hellip;",

    "content": "The 2025 Medicare Trustees report concludes that Medicare remains on an unsustainable course given rising per-beneficiary spending and worsening demographics as the Baby Boomers age. The latest annual report from the Board of Medicare Trustees brings less favorable news than last year for Medicare’s Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund, one barometer for the health of the Medicare program as a whole. The Medicare Trustees now predict that the Part A (hospital) trust fund will be depleted by 2033, three years earlier than predicted in last year’s Trustees’ report. If not addressed, Medicare providers would see an 11% reduction in their payments. Federal policymakers must advance comprehensive reforms to the Medicare program to ensure its long-term solvency and improve care for the program’s nearly 68 million seniors and individuals with disabilities. The Bipartisan Policy Center has taken a leadership role in offering recommendations for bipartisan improvements to the Medicare program’s sustainability and effectiveness. Most recently, BPC Senior Vice President Bill Hoagland co-authored an article in Health Affairs Forefront with scholars at the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution discussing several pragmatic and potentially bipartisan Medicare reforms that could produce significant federal savings. These reforms include: Medicare site neutrality (lessening inequities in Medicare payment between hospital and outpatient settings) A competitive bidding system for Medicare Advantage (MA) Restraint of hospital consolidation Taken together, these changes could offer beneficiaries and taxpayers tens of billions in savings. Going deeper, BPC experts undertook a comprehensive examination of Medicare’s fiscal and operational challenges in a 2023 report, Sustaining and Improving Medicare: The Path Forward. The report provides a two-step roadmap for Congress to tackle Medicare’s solvency and affordability challenges. Phase I would secure meaningful improvements that would make Medicare more affordable for taxpayers and beneficiaries. BPC&#8217;s roadmap would enable Congress to immediately address the Part A trust fund’s impending insolvency and affordability challenges. More specifically, BPC proposes slowing spending increases and raising revenues, while at the same time enhancing benefits, reducing costs, and simplifying the program for easier access. Phase II of BPC’s plan proposes a bold shift in how Medicare is funded and operated. Specifically, BPC advocates the creation of an apples-to-apples competitive bidding system between traditional Medicare and MA — thereby allowing beneficiaries to easily compare coverage options based on a standard set of benefits. The annual Medicare Trustees’ report is an important wake up call for policymakers in the executive branch and Congress. For the ninth straight year, the Trustees have issued a Medicare funding warning that calls on the president to propose legislation to bring Medicare spending and revenues in line. This year’s Trustees report is a stark reminder that the time for action is now.",

    "content": "This blog post has been updated to use projections from the 2025 Social Security Trustees Report. Social Security’s Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) is the cornerstone of retirement security for millions of Americans, but it faces a critical financial threat. The program&#8217;s trust fund is projected to be depleted in 2033, leaving it unable to pay full benefits. The Bipartisan Policy Center has for many years called for bipartisan, comprehensive Social Security reform to strengthen the program’s finances—the only path forward for effective and durable changes that modernize and shore up the program for those who rely on it most. Failure to act before the trust fund is depleted would result in one of two outcomes: a financial shock to beneficiaries who rely on the program or a crystal-clear signal to global investors that policymakers don’t acknowledge America’s unsustainable debt burden as a priority. Across-the-Board Benefit Cuts At the time of trust fund depletion, Social Security benefit outlays would automatically fall so as not to exceed program revenue, resulting in an across-the-board benefit cut of 23% for current and future recipients absent legislative action. Given projections of scheduled benefits, this 23% cut would amount to $625 less per month for the average beneficiary in 2033, or more than $7,500 per year. Social Security benefits are the largest source of income for many older Americans: For more than 20% of those aged 65 or older, Social Security makes up at least 75% of household income, and for nearly 14% of Americans aged 65 or older, Social Security makes up at least 90% of household income. Across-the-board cuts to a program responsible for keeping 23 million Americans out of poverty would impose significant burdens on families and communities. A projected 55% increase in the elderly poverty rate by 2045 would create immense hardship. The communities and business sectors that serve beneficiaries would experience disruption and perhaps contraction. And it is likely that more caregiving needs would fall to families, which could destabilize life for many workers. The federal deficit would fall and some people either receiving or expecting lower Social Security income would choose to work longer, but the abruptness of such a change would be harmful to beneficiaries, their families, and the economy writ large. Even if only half of the 23% benefit cut actually translated into lower spending, consumption would drop by more than $320 billion per year, on average, between 2034 and 2043, or 0.6% of gross domestic product (GDP). If left unaddressed, the annual lost consumption would have a larger effect, as a percentage of GDP, each year until around 2080, when the gap would total 0.9% of GDP. If the entire benefit reduction represented lost spending, the gap would total 1.2%–1.9% of GDP annually over the coming decades. Size of benefit reductions would increase for decades Projected annual Social Security benefit reductions Projected annual Social Security shortfall as percentage of GDP Borrowing to Maintain Benefits Given the pain that steep benefit cuts would inflict, Congress could choose&hellip;",

    "content": "For many policymakers and housing stakeholders, ending the conservatorship of government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac represents the last piece of unfinished business from the 2007–2008 financial crisis. In the years since the GSEs entered conservatorship, their dominance in the market has only grown, while the federal government’s role in housing finance has become further entrenched. As the Trump administration considers options for ending the conservatorship, it is crucial that any exit strategy clarifies the GSEs’ roles in both the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets, maintains affordable mortgage credit, minimizes taxpayer risk, duly considers the impact of ending conservatorship to our interconnected housing finance system, and promotes market stability. The Bipartisan Policy Center has been working to forge a bipartisan path forward on comprehensive housing finance reform since the release of the BPC Housing Commission’s 2013 report, Housing America’s Future: New Directions for National Policy. Building on this history, though recognizing the realities of the GSEs’ nearly 17-year conservatorship, we offer the principles outlined below. Our aim is to provide a clear, bipartisan framework for a thoughtful exit from conservatorship, considering the significant economic and political challenges involved. A reformed housing finance system should promote the uninterrupted and broad availability of affordable mortgage credit, while reducing the federal government’s exposure, shrinking its footprint, and protecting American taxpayers. The federal government conferred substantial benefits on the GSEs before conservatorship, and these benefits should not continue out of conservatorship without adequate taxpayer compensation. Extending mortgage credit and absorbing a preponderance of the risk is a role that private capital can and should continue to play for the vast majority of loans originated. There must be a clear, institutionalized structure for the government to expand its catastrophic credit-risk role temporarily and flexibly during severe economic downturns. To ensure the continued safety and soundness of our housing finance system and that the GSEs are operating within their charter-granted mission, the GSEs must have a strong prudential regulator, robust capital standards, and clarified market structures that reflect a post-conservatorship evaluation of the appropriateness of the many market-changing reforms implemented during the GSEs’ conservatorship. Because of the size and importance of the GSEs to both the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets, as well as the broader financial system, an orderly exit from conservatorship requires a well-conceived plan with a clearly communicated timeline and steps that give investors, borrowers, taxpayers, and other stakeholders confidence. To optimally provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market, reform should further a coordinated housing finance policy and contemplate the appropriate roles and responsibilities of the different government entities that support the housing finance system, ensuring that the government does not crowd out the private sector from market segments where it can efficiently supply adequate capital. These principles reflect some of the key areas of bipartisan consensus that have emerged after years of debate about the GSEs&#8217; futures. BPC will continue to monitor proposed changes to the GSEs and assess their potential impact on housing policy, markets and&hellip;",

    "content": "On May 30, the Trump administration released its full discretionary budget request for fiscal year 2026. The budget proposes a nearly 23% reduction in nondefense discretionary spending compared to current spending levels. The request includes a 44% reduction in funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) compared to FY2025. The administration aims to achieve the reduction by consolidating HUD’s largest rental assistance programs and eliminating programs related to homelessness, community development, housing for Native communities, and fair housing. The budget also includes reforms and cuts to housing programs administered by other federal agencies. A summary of the specific changes are outlined below.i Department of Housing and Urban Development  Overall Funding (-$32.9B) Reduces overall funding for HUD by 44% compared to FY2025  Rental Assistance (-$26.7B) Reduces rental assistance funding by about 43% Consolidates the five largest federal rental assistance programs into a state-based formula block grant program that prioritizes funding for households with elderly individuals or persons with disabilities. Programs to be consolidated include: Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (Housing Choice Voucher Program) Project-Based Rental Assistance Public Housing Section 202 Housing for the Elderly Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities Imposes a two-year limit on assistance for nonelderly, able-bodied adults. Funds Foster Youth to Independence grants at $25 million for youth aging out of foster care. Homelessness Assistance (-$532M) Reduces overall funding for Homeless Assistance Grants by eliminating programs that administer long-term assistance to people experiencing homelessness, including: Continuum of Care (CoC) program Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) program Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) National Homeless Data Analysis Project Reforms the Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) program to provide emergency, short- and medium-term assistance (limited to two years), targeting geographic areas with greatest need. Native American Housing (-$273M) Reduces HUD’s Native American programs and Native Hawaiian Block Grant by reducing funding for Indian Housing Block Grants by more than 22% and eliminating the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program. Community Development (-$4.7B) Eliminates several community development programs, including: The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) Self-Sufficiency (-$196M) Eliminates the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS), Jobs-Plus Pilot, and the Resident Opportunity and Self-Sufficiency (ROSS) programs. Fair Housing (-$60M) Eliminates the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) and the National Fair Housing Training Academy.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development and Rural Housing Service (-$997M) Reduces overall funding for USDA rural housing programs by: Eliminating rural housing vouchers, single-family direct loans, housing preservation grants and mutual and self-help housing grants. Limiting funding for home repair grants, multifamily preservation and revitalization demonstration, and multifamily direct loans. Rural Rental Assistance (+$73Mii) Funds the renewal of USDA rental assistance grant contracts at $1.7 billion. Department of the Treasury Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund (-$191M) Eliminates Treasury’s CDFI Fund discretionary awards, which are intended to support economic and community development in low-income areas.

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, into law. Republicans used the budget reconciliation process to extend and expand expiring tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) and to implement new administration priorities. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill will increase deficits by $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Although Congress often passes tax legislation that takes effect in the following calendar year, several tax cuts in H.R. 1 take effect this year, in 2025. Making retroactive changes to the tax code can more quickly deliver tax cuts to intended beneficiaries but can also pose implementation challenges for the IRS. Below, BPC summarizes the provisions of H.R. 1 that are effective in 2025. What tax changes in the GOP tax law are effective in 2025? The following table summarizes the major tax changes effective for 2025 under H.R. 1. The taxpayers who benefit from these provisions will get a tax cut when they file their tax returns in 2026. If the changes were effective in 2026 instead of 2025, taxpayers would not see some of the benefits until filing their tax return in 2027. The changes that will benefit the highest number of taxpayers are the increases in the standard deduction and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). Around 143 million tax returns claimed the standard deduction in 2023 (90% of all returns) and 38 million returns claimed the non-refundable portion of the CTC in the same year. The charts below demonstrate some of the changes that Americans can expect from these tax cuts when they file their tax returns in 2026. How will these changes affect taxpayers, tax preparers, and the IRS? Making retroactive tax changes—in other words, changes backdated to January 1, 2025—allows lawmakers to quickly deliver tax cuts to workers, families, or businesses. Many taxpayers will see their tax liability go down when they file their tax returns in 2026. Brand new provisions in the tax code can, however, present implementation challenges for tax preparers and the IRS. For one, the IRS will have only a few months to write potentially complicated rules for claiming entirely new tax benefits like deductions for tips, overtime, and auto loan interest. Online tax preparation companies will have to write new code based on these rules so that taxpayers could claim these benefits using software. Employers responsible for reporting specific information to the IRS, such as for the no tax on tips deduction, will face new requirements to verify employee eligibility. Retroactive policies also cannot directly incentivize behavior, though they may indirectly incentivize more consumption or investment by providing taxpayers with a one-time windfall.

    "content": "Since its inception in 2007, the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) has significantly impacted various domestic policy issues, from tax to housing policy. However, it has not had a presence in the K-12 education policy community—until now. What does bipartisanship even look like in education policy? Is there one Democratic and Republican view of the federal role, investment in education and high-quality schools? Hardly. But like any issue, when we strip away rhetoric and focus on core ideas and concerns, it becomes easier to find common ground and work together on a path forward towards good policy. Bipartisanship requires significant work at all levels of government, but is not impossible, given that current authorizations of federal education funding passed on a bipartisan basis. But it has been nearly ten years since Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed, and five years overdue for reauthorization.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) passed 20 years ago and was due to be reauthorized in 2011. Getting to the Root of the Issue While there are fundamental disagreements about how to approach education policy in Congress, the best intentions are bipartisan: ensure that our children can lead flourishing lives. Unfortunately, this grounding intention is at risk. After decades of progress, recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data reveal that the achievement of students in the lowest quartile is declining at an alarming rate. The progress made during the Bush and Obama administrations started to stall before the pandemic. Instead of focusing on working together, however, our national conversation about education policy has become too fragmented, with different groups promoting silver-bullet solutions. Debates often center on narrow issues, such as funding, local control, accountability or school choice, or transferring federal programs to different agencies, without addressing the deeper challenges. At stake are student well-being, access to meaningful careers, and long-term economic mobility. The broader economic impact is also clear: as birth rates decline, the number of high school graduates is projected to fall by 13% in the next 15 years, or 500,000 students. BPC’s Engagement in K-12 Education BPC aims to bring coherence to the national conversation as a trusted source of policy insights and evidence-based research, and we will begin our work in K-12 education policy through two primary initiatives: the Commission on the American Workforce and the new education policy program within the Human Capital team. Commission on the American Workforce The Commission on the American Workforce, co-chaired by former Governors Deval Patrick and Bill Haslam, will develop a national, bipartisan strategy to strengthen the workforce, expand economic opportunity, and ensure the United States remains competitive. For elementary and secondary education, this means focusing on policy levers that will enable every child to access a high-quality education, and ultimately, flourish as adults in their chosen pathways. The Commission is also addressing how to ensure that the educational pathways lead to in-demand careers. The Commission’s elementary and secondary education working group has brought together diverse leaders to debate, discuss and develop recommendations. In&hellip;",

On July 4, President Trump signed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, into law. The law features major changes to the federal tax code, including the extension of trillions of dollars in expiring policies from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill will increase deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years. One significant change is to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a provision that has inspired major debate in Congress since TCJA imposed a $10,000 cap on SALT deductions in 2018. Below we review the adjustments to the SALT deduction for individuals and businesses, explain how these changes interact with other parts of the U.S. tax code, and show how SALT reforms affect taxpayers and the federal budget. How would the 2025 tax law change the SALT deduction? OBBB makes major changes to the SALT deduction for individuals, families, and certain businesses. These changes will cost around $140 billion over 10 years relative to continuing TCJA’s $10,000 SALT cap. Individuals and Families Effective 2025, OBBB: Increases the $10,000 SALT cap to $40,000. Phases down the $40,000 SALT cap (to $10,000) at a 30% rate for taxpayers making over $500,000. Here’s how that phasedown would look for taxpayers making between $0 and $600,000: The law increases the $40,000 SALT cap and $500,000 income threshold by 1% each year from 2026 through 2029, with the cap reset to $10,000 from 2030 onwards. Here’s how the SALT cap and phasedown threshold would be adjusted from 2026 through 2030: Table 1. SALT Cap and Threshold Amounts Under H.R. 1, 2025-2030 SALT Cap Income Threshold at Which SALT Cap Begins Phasing Down 2025 $40,000 $500,000 2026 $40,400 $505,000 2027 $40,804 $510,050 2028 $41,212 $515,151 2029 $41,624 $520,302 2030 and subsequent years $10,000 N/A Businesses OBBB does not change SALT deductibility for either pass-through businesses—such as S corporations and partnerships—or C corporations. For more on how the SALT deduction works for businesses, see here. How will the SALT changes interact with other parts of the tax code? Much like the $10,000 SALT cap for individuals and families in TCJA, the new $40,000 SALT cap interacts with several other provisions of the tax code: The standard deduction: Taxpayers can either itemize deductions (including SALT) or claim the standard deduction. In 2022, 90% of taxpayers claimed the standard deduction. OBBB increases the standard deduction by $750 for single taxpayers and $1,500 for married taxpayers in 2025, adjusting for inflation after 2025. Despite this increase, the bill’s $40,000 SALT cap will likely induce some households that currently take the standard deduction to itemize instead. The alternative minimum tax (AMT): Before TCJA, the AMT applied to more than 5 million taxpayers (around 3%) and took a bite out of SALT for many six-figure households by requiring them to&hellip;",

    "content": "When children are removed from their parents’ care and placed in foster care, child welfare agencies seek to facilitate safe and timely reunification whenever appropriate. Should efforts to reunify prove unsuccessful, these agencies must identify alternative family options for a child. Regardless of the outcome, these decisions must be conducted in a manner that prioritizes the long-term wellbeing of the child. We are honored to co-chair a new working group as part of BPC’s Child Welfare Initiative that will convene thirteen distinguished child welfare experts to examine how our nation’s child welfare system ensures permanency for children in foster care, with a focus on the policies and practices related to the appropriate use and timing of termination of birth parents’ rights. The working group has a timely opportunity to develop recommendations that can improve outcomes for children and families and strengthen agencies’ permanency planning efforts As we launch this effort, we acknowledge that few issues related to child welfare engender such an emotional reaction as termination of parental rights (TPR). Despite deep feelings and seemingly opposed perspectives on the issue, there is shared acknowledgement across the field of the importance of children having permanent, nurturing families. Likewise, there is agreement that policies and practices should prioritize maintaining and reunifying children with their birth families whenever possible. There is also widespread recognition that existing policies and practices are failing children and families. Agency efforts to support permanency suffer from inconsistent case practices, high caseloads, turnover for caseworkers and lawyers who represent child welfare agencies, and an inability to track both the provision of reunification supports and permanency timelines. Courts’ permanency planning practices are similarly inconsistent and overburdened. For each child in foster care, the courts oversee case-planning efforts to ensure the child’s safety and well-being and monitor progress in meeting permanency goals. In some cases, federal and state laws provide courts with the authority to terminate parental rights. The appropriate use and timing of TPR have faced significant scrutiny. Some child welfare experts argue that current timelines for TPR decisions are often too short, as agencies fail to prioritize or do not adequately support reunification efforts. Others argue that agencies fail to TPR in a timely manner, leaving children in foster care for unnecessarily long periods of time after reunification has been ruled out or deemed extremely unlikely. Many child welfare experts believe both of these concerns are accurate. Over the next year, the working group will examine existing policy and practice, review data and research, and hear from experts with various perspectives to develop durable recommendations on how best to simultaneously support efforts to reunify children with their birth families and achieve timely permanence. We will also coordinate with BPC’s working group on child welfare financing and accountability to address important cross-cutting issues. &nbsp;",

    "content": "On May 22, the House of Representatives passed a large piece of legislation through the reconciliation process—now under consideration in the Senate—that would change how higher education is financed in the U.S. The provisions include changes to student loan borrowing limits, loan repayment, Pell Grant eligibility, institutional accountability, and Workforce Pell. The CBO estimates that these policies would save about $350 billion over the next 10 years, partially offsetting the cost of the broader reconciliation bill, which is expected to add trillions to federal deficits. The House bill would make significant changes to the federal student loan program, particularly to loan repayment options. BPC has made several recommendations for reforming the program in recent years. Last month, BPC further outlined a range of policy options for reducing the cost of student loans while targeting relief to struggling borrowers. This brief outlines key student loan provisions in the House package, discusses their potential for addressing the challenges facing the student loan program, and highlights questions and issues for legislators to consider as the reconciliation process progresses. Reforming Income-Driven Repayment The Biden administration’s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, rolled out in 2023, aimed to replace the existing maze of IDR options and tackle other challenges in the system. However, it is very expensive (potentially costing more than $400 billion over 10 years) and not well targeted. It is also now subject to court injunctions and unlikely to reach full implementation. BPC has suggested that legislators replace the SAVE plan with a less expensive option that would better target relief to low-income borrowers struggling with repayment. The House package would replace the SAVE IDR plan with the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). The table below shows the key differences between RAP and SAVE. It also includes two older IDR plans—Income-Based Repayment (IBR) and Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)—to show how RAP compares to the IDR options that existed before SAVE: IBR/REPAYE SAVE RAP Income Exemption 150% of the federal poverty level 225% of the federal poverty level None; $10 minimum monthly payment required from all borrowers Payment 10% of discretionary income; 15% for IBR borrowers who borrowed before 2014 5% of discretionary income for undergrad; 10% for grad loans 1% of income for borrowers with adjusted gross income (AGI) between $10,000 and $20,000; 2% of income for borrowers with AGI between $20,001 and $30,000, etc., up to 10% of income for borrowers with AGI over $100,000Payment reduced by $50/month for each dependent child Forgiveness 20 years; 25 years for graduate loans under REPAYE25 years for IBR borrowers who first borrowed before 2014 20 years for undergraduate borrowers; 25 years for graduate borrowersUndergraduate borrowers entering repayment with $12,000 or less in debt eligible for forgiveness in 10 years; for each additional $1,000 borrowed, borrowers would have one additional year to forgiveness, up to a maximum of 20 years 30 years Unpaid Interest Capitalizes into balance; REPAYE waives half of unpaid interest No interest charged beyond what borrower pays; balance&hellip;",

    "content": "As the debate over how to handle the expiration of trillions of dollars in tax policies from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) now heads to the Senate, one outstanding question is what the deficit impact will be. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to extend and expand $4 trillion in expiring provisions from TCJA and to implement new administration priorities. BPC shares lawmakers’ interest in extending many of the expiring tax cuts for workers and families, but to secure their pro-growth benefits, the cost should be offset. Paying for tax cuts—and engaging in deficit reduction writ large—is critically important because: It grows the economy by diverting resources away from public (government) debt and toward more productive private investment. It ensures interest rates on public debt will be lower than if Congress extends the tax cuts without paying for them, which in turn will help lower interest rates throughout the economy (for mortgages, auto loans, small business lending, etc.). It catalyzes extra interest savings with every dollar that is shaved from worrying fiscal projections. Fiscal State of Play in the House vs. Senate The House and the Senate have presented very different visions for the final reconciliation bill’s impact on government debt and deficits: The House passed reconciliation legislation on May 22, 2025, comprised of $3.9 trillion in net tax cuts and $1.5 trillion in net spending cuts. As a result, the legislation will likely add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years on a current law baseline, and more if temporary tax cuts in the bill are eventually made permanent. The Senate’s budget framework put a higher $5.3 trillion ceiling on tax cuts (through use of a current policy baseline), a $346 billion ceiling on new spending, and a $4 billion floor on spending cuts. This nets out to up to $5.7 trillion in higher deficits over 10 years, though the Senate has yet to publicly release full bill text. Fiscal Responsibility Can Reduce Interest Rates When lawmakers reduce government debt and deficits, bond investors have greater confidence they&#8217;ll get their money back and that inflation won&#8217;t eat away at its value—so they settle for lower yields. There&#8217;s also a smaller supply of U.S. government bonds relative to demand, which means the Treasury can auction them off at lower interest rates. Former Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Doug Elmendorf found, in a 1996 paper for the Federal Reserve, that policymaker actions to reduce the debt can reduce real interest rates. Multiple other analyses have found that higher debt and deficits lead to upward pressure on interest rates. Paying for the cost of extending and expanding tax cuts will directly lead to lower interest rates than extension without offsets. Lower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs throughout the economy. That makes it easier for people to buy a home or a car and pay off credit card debt, and easier for businesses to invest in ways that create jobs and grow the economy. Lower interest rates also&hellip;",

    "content": "In March, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases implicating two judicial doctrines—the nondelegation and major questions doctrines—with rulings expected to be released in the coming weeks. How those decisions come down regarding these doctrines will have consequences beyond the courtroom, and Capitol Hill should be paying particularly close attention. Recent cases suggest these judicial doctrines will remain in the legal spotlight. Although it did not rely on either doctrine for its decision, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) mentioned them in its May 28th ruling that many tariffs recently enacted by the Trump administration are unauthorized, and that invoking the doctrines would have invalidated the tariffs: “The parties cite two doctrines—the nondelegation doctrine and the major questions doctrine—that the judiciary has developed to ensure that the branches do not impermissibly abdicate their respective constitutionally vested powers.” BPC’s Working Group on Congress, Courts, and Administrative Law recently examined these doctrines’ implications for lawmakers in Congress and their relationship with the executive branch. Its report identified actions that Congress may need to take—such as expanding its own capabilities for drafting laws—should these doctrines reshape the contours of executive power. What is a Judicial Doctrine? Courts develop rules or guidelines, referred to as “doctrines,” to help them address “common threads,” or specific, recurring questions across different cases and contexts. Doctrines have been analogized to “tools” or “building blocks” that allow judges to more efficiently and consistently resolve judicial disputes. Respect for judicial precedent, for example, is a doctrine; not every doctrine is as well defined or widely accepted as that. The nondelegation and major questions doctrines exemplify both the utility of such tools and the contentiousness that can arise over their validity. What is the Nondelegation Doctrine? The nondelegation doctrine stipulates that Congress may not yield its Article I legislative powers to the executive branch, although the Supreme Court has not struck down an action on its grounds since 1935. When faced with a nondelegation claim, the court typically applies a rough test: if Congress has set forth an “intelligible principle”—or clear, discrete direction—to guide an agency, no impermissible delegation has occurred. Justice Gorsuch has advanced the most forceful case for the doctrine’s revival, arguing that if Congress “could pass off its legislative power to the executive branch … legislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of the current President,” ultimately undermining stability and democratic accountability. What is the Major Questions Doctrine? According to the Supreme Court, Congress itself is responsible for litigating decisions of “vast economic and political significance” and considering “the basic and consequential tradeoffs involved.” It can delegate broad responsibility to the executive branch to help address significant policy issues but must draw explicit boundaries. When an agency “claims to have found a previously unheralded power” that represents a “transformative expansion” of its authority and fundamental change to the statutory scheme, its actions are invalid without “clear congressional authorization.” By implication, Congress can authorize the executive branch to take sweeping and unprecedented actions regarding issues&hellip;",

    "content": "U.S. Treasurys have long been viewed as a safe, highly liquid investment to lenders worldwide, fueling the low borrowing costs and vast financial capacity of the U.S. federal government. The share of the federal debt held by foreign investors (“foreign debt” throughout this blog), whether governments or individuals, is on the decline. Foreign bank accounts hold more than $8.5 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, which represents a substantial chunk of the publicly held federal debt—about 30%. This is down, however, from almost 50% in the early 2010s. Although reduced ownership of our debt by competitors or adversaries may appeal to policymakers worried about the potential risks and costs of such debts, a robust demand for U.S. Treasurys is important for the fiscal health of the country. Foreign lending helps fund our deficits, keeps Treasury yields low, and solidifies America’s position as the preeminent global vault. Fiscally irresponsible borrowing drives the supply of U.S. debt up, and if demand doesn’t keep pace, it threatens America’s ability to lead. When demand for U.S. Treasurys slows, as it has since 2013, the obvious question is why. This blog unpacks the forces driving the foreign shift away from U.S. Treasurys. Trends in Foreign Debt While foreign debt as a share of the overall public debt has declined from a 2008 peak of 49%, the share of U.S. debt in foreign accounts is still well above what it was in the early 90s. One major trend behind the falling foreign share of U.S. debt is simply that the supply of U.S. debt has grown faster than foreign purchases of that debt. Debt held by the public has more than quadrupled since 2008, from $6.4 trillion to $28.9 trillion by the end of 2024. Foreign debt has also grown, but only from $3.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion. Foreign demand for our debt is not limitless. When our borrowing needs grow faster than demand for Treasurys, the U.S. must offer higher interest rates to investors to balance supply and demand. This has significant ripple effects for families, as borrowing rates for mortgages, auto loans, and small business lending are all tied to the interest rates on Treasurys. The composition of countries holding U.S. debt has also changed. Since the mid-2010s, the share of foreign debt owned by China has gradually declined. It’s unclear whether this divestment is intentional Chinese state action, an effort to diversify, or merely a shift to harder-to-measure ways of holding U.S. Treasurys. An important limitation of the Treasury Department’s data on foreign holdings is that some investors hold U.S. debt through non-U.S. custodial accounts that may obscure the country of origin. Partially offsetting China’s declining share is a substantial increase in U.S. debt held by private and public investors in the United Kingdom, which recently surpassed China as the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasurys after Japan. As a major financial center, some of this growth could represent other countries investing in the U.S. through the U.K., rather than U.K. investment alone. Although&hellip;",

    "content": "On May 16, Moody’s became the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating, following downgrades from S&amp;P and Fitch in 2011 and 2023, respectively. U.S. Treasury securities have long been known as the “gold standard” of global credit, but these downgrades demonstrate that their elevated status is slowly deteriorating. The downgrade of our AAA rating serves as an urgent escalation of the need to prioritize fiscal responsibility. Each rating agency has cited unsustainable fiscal deficits, debt growth projections, and continued partisan gridlock as threats to America’s long-run creditworthiness. Lenders to the U.S. are taking notice, as evidenced by the upward trend in Treasury yields this month. Higher federal borrowing costs aren’t an abstract concern: They also put pressure on Americans’ pocketbooks through higher borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business expansion. It’s past time for policymakers from both parties to heed those warning signs and work across the aisle to address these urgent challenges. For many years, lawmakers in Congress have allowed the federal government’s fiscal position to slide, diminishing our ability to invest in shared national priorities or to course correct should a crisis occur. Publicly held debt was a reasonable 34% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000. By the time of S&amp;P’s downgrade in 2011, it had nearly doubled to 65% of GDP. The debt has now reached 100% of GDP and is projected to blow past historical records in the coming years. Interest payments on this mountain of debt have ballooned to consume 18% of annual revenue—now exceeding defense and Medicare spending—and will only grow further. Making progress on our crippling national debt will require difficult choices that must be bipartisan to be durable and sustained. The U.S. enjoys many privileges that have enabled borrowing on favorable terms, including the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency and a dynamic economy that has been the envy of the world. But even those advantages are not guaranteed to last without careful stewardship. Bond markets are showing increasing signs that global demand for the exploding supply of U.S. government debt is not endless. Recurring near misses raising the debt limit since 2011 further weaken our standing. Waiting until the eleventh hour to act while neglecting the underlying drivers of debt growth has not only prompted ratings downgrades, but has stoked doubts about lawmakers’ ability to avert a self-inflicted crisis. Prompt action to de-risk the debt limit could go a long way to restore faith in U.S. debt. This latest downgrade should give further pause to contemplating legislation that worsens deficits. No policy agenda, whether ambitious new spending or generous tax cuts, will prove durable if it does not move us toward stabilizing and eventually reducing the debt. Choosing to remain on the current fiscally unsustainable path carries uncertainty for households and businesses, slows economic growth, and pushes interest rates higher for hardworking Americans and the government. Continuing down this road will threaten priorities such as public safety, public health,&hellip;",

    "content": "Both parties realize that government has long failed to deliver on the promises that candidates make to improve federal government efficiency and effectiveness—and the electorate is taking notice. But for the first time in a long time, there is reason to believe members of Congress are recognizing the responsibility of the first branch in driving oversight and strengthening effectiveness. Congress has a duty to conduct oversight and ensure government programs are administered efficiently and effectively. But policymakers have expressed surprise at some of the more provocative findings by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), despite having copious data, information, and recommendations for improvement available to them all along. For over a century, Congress has relied on nonpartisan support entities to help it gather and process information and monitor the executive branch for waste, fraud, and abuse. Given the growth and prevalence of these sophisticated investigators and analysts, why have problems persisted? One explanation may be that Congress is simply not listening as much as they used to or could be. As illustrated below, there has been a decades-long decline in witness testimony and implementation of recommendations from Congress’s key oversight entities: the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Offices of Inspectors General (OIG). As DOGE begins to enter a new phase—and those involved recognize that its work should mostly be accomplished through Congress—it should consider recommendations for increasing congressional capacity to retake the mantle on oversight and efficiency moving forward. Information Collection Challenges The House and Senate each have dedicated oversight committees, and most other standing committees have oversight subcommittees responsible for monitoring programs within their jurisdiction. Committees and subcommittees have historically been the information-processing hubs of the legislative branch, where members can focus their attention on discrete issues and receive expert and political input from a variety of stakeholders. However, as others have noted, committee work has declined as incentives and policymaking within Congress have shifted elsewhere. One way to measure committee activity and information processing is through the number of formal hearings held. As the chart below shows, there has been a stark decline in the number of hearings held each Congress since the 101st Congress (1989-1990). The 116th Congress (2019-2020) appears to have held the lowest number of oversight hearings in decades. Even when Congress does hold oversight hearings, there is reason to believe those hearings are less informed about executive branch operations than they once were: research shows a sharp decline in the number of executive branch witnesses participating in congressional hearings. This is partially the result of executive branch staff not wanting to subject themselves to the partisan political theater that has come to characterize many oversight hearings. As with executive branch witness appearances, there has also been a steep decline in testimony by congressional support agencies, primarily the Government Accountability Office and Offices of Inspectors General. GAO and OIGs monitor agency operations, conduct financial and performance audits, and make reports to Congress. Each year, they generate hundreds of recommendations that would result in substantial cost&hellip;",

    "content": "As the United States faces &#8220;Peak 65&#8220;—the largest surge of retirements in American history as baby boomers age—the need for robust retirement income solutions has never been more pressing. The long standing “three-legged stool” of retirement security—pensions, Social Security, and personal savings—is wobbling. The pension leg is mostly gone, and the future of Social Security is deeply uncertain. The defined contribution (DC) system has been immensely successful in helping many Americans save for retirement, but retirees struggle with turning that pot of personal savings into income. Early claiming of Social Security benefits, which results in lower monthly payouts for life, further exacerbates the shortage of retirement income. As a result, a staggering 84% of Generation X worry about lacking income in retirement, and across generations only 44% of Americans have a plan for how they will take income in retirement. These stats underscore the importance of predictable, lifelong income streams that can supplement Social Security and provide both financial security and peace of mind. Focusing on income rather than assets harnesses a critical behavioral insight: individuals feel more confident spending annuitized income rather than spending down a lump sum of savings. “Safe Harbors” Are Key for Encouraging Retirement Income in DC Plans This spring, the Bipartisan Policy Center, Prudential Financial, TIAA, and the Alliance for Lifetime Income (ALI) convened leading experts, including retirement researchers, personal finance professionals, industry executives, and congressional staff, to discuss the retirement challenges Americans are facing and explore policy options for incorporating protected income into DC retirement plans. Our conversation underscored the widespread and increasing acknowledgment among stakeholders that incorporating protected-income solutions such as annuities (financial products that offer guaranteed income streams) in DC plans can increase retirement spending and reduce risk. But annuities are rarely included in target-date funds (TDFs) or other retirement plan defaults despite the benefits, largely due to legal and regulatory concerns. Several policy options could help address these issues, including safe harbors for plans that: Implement an active-choice approach for retirement-income features. Whereas an opt-out policy automatically enrolls those who take no action, and an opt-in policy requires individuals to take initiative to enroll, an active-choice framework lays out several options and requires individuals to choose their preference. An active-choice approach holds special promise for the use of protected income within workplace retirement plans, as savers express significant interest in such solutions even while opt-out approaches might not be appropriate because some protected-income choices are irrevocable. Use employer contributions to purchase protected income streams by default (or using active choice) beginning at age 50 or 55. Irrevocable or difficult-to-reverse investments in protected income could be substantially more palatable if they are made with employers’ contributions rather than employees’ payroll deductions. One point of broad agreement among consulted experts was that allocating savings to annuity purchases should typically begin around the age of 50, allowing sufficient time to build a guaranteed income &#8220;sleeve&#8221; in a DC plan portfolio. Offer participants a service that automates laddering for purchases of a protected-income product. Just&hellip;",

    "content": "The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) new tech-neutral Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC) went into effect at the start of 2025. Unlike the long-standing, technology-specific PTC and ITC, the tech-neutral replacements apply to any generation or storage project that produces zero-emission electricity, including advanced nuclear, geothermal, and other nascent technologies, in addition to traditional renewables such as wind and solar, as well as nuclear. This blog post will explore the benefits of these novel tech-neutral credits, how they support American innovation and affordability, and their importance to meeting growing U.S. electricity demand. What are Tech-Neutral Tax Credits? The legacy technology-specific PTC and ITC, enacted in 1992 and 2005, respectively, have supported clean electricity projects for decades. However, not all electricity generation technologies were eligible for the credits. Instead, new technologies needed to reach market viability before obtaining explicit access to the credits. For example, the original PTC was only available to electricity generated from wind or closed loop biomass until legislation enacted in 2004 added geothermal and solar as eligible technologies. Congress has let these credits expire on multiple occasions—a source of instability that dampened their long-term impact. The legacy PTC was extended 12 times between 1992-2020, and the credit was allowed to expire and lapse seven of those times. Congress updated those tax credits into the IRA’s 48E and 45Y tech-neutral tax credit and added additional qualifying electric generating technologies. The new tech-neutral ITC and PTC provide a different eligibility framework. To qualify for the tech-neutral credits, a facility must generate or store electricity with zero or net-negative greenhouse gas emissions. Eligible clean electricity technologies include wind, solar, hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic, geothermal, nuclear fission and fusion, and certain types of waste energy recovery. The law allows for other technologies that demonstrate the emissions requirements to qualify as well. 48E and 45Y will begin to phase out in 2032 or when U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are equal to 25% of 2022 emissions or lower. Although the legacy technology-specific ITC and PTC have been replaced, projects that began construction prior to 2025 or that incurred at least 5% of the cost of the facility before 2025 will still have access to the legacy credits through safe harbor requirements. Tech-neutral credits help keep electricity rates affordable. The new technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits improve affordability of American electricity and reduce overall electricity costs for households and businesses. A recent study from Aurora Energy, an energy consulting firm, shows that the removal of these credits could lead to a stark increase in retail rates and a decline in investments and jobs. The study estimates that the removal of these credits could result in $336 billion in lost investments, 237 gigawatts (GW) in forgone electricity generation, and 97,000 fewer American jobs. The same study shows that repealing the tech-neutral credits would increase residential electricity costs by an average of 10% nationwide, with even sharper increases in states like New York&hellip;",

    "content": "Evictions don’t just displace families—they have lasting impacts on many other areas of life, such as education, employment, and mental and physical health. Evictions, and even the threat of eviction, can be costly for tenants and landlords alike. The ripple effects of an eviction can also extend to the surrounding community, weakening neighborhood stability. Yet before the COVID-19 pandemic, eviction prevention programs were rare. Families who missed rent due to a job loss, medical emergency, or other crisis often had few resources to recover. According to the best available evidence, between 2007 and 2016, an average of 7.6 million renters faced the threat of eviction each year, over half of whom eventually received an eviction judgement. A Federal Opportunity With an increasing number of households facing high housing cost burdens and the number of evictions rising, the 119th Congress and Trump administration have an opportunity to revisit lapsed federal supports for state and local eviction prevention programs. Such an effort can draw on hard-learned lessons from policies enacted during the pandemic and help to preserve critical partnerships and program infrastructure developed at that time. While federal resources remain limited and under close scrutiny, a standing emergency rental assistance program—as previously recommended by BPC—could offer a cost-effective way to prevent the long-term detrimental impacts of housing instability and eviction on vulnerable households. Pandemic Policies and Programs The COVID-19 pandemic had an immediate, severe impact on the U.S. labor market, leading to a widespread loss of wages that left many households unable to pay their monthly housing expenses. By late 2020, nearly one-fifth of renters were behind on payments. Renters’ decreased ability to pay their housing costs also adversely impacted landlords—the share of landlords collecting 90% or more of rent owed dropped by nearly one-third between 2019 and 2020. In response, federal policymakers took numerous actions to keep American renters stably housed. Eviction Moratoriums: To prevent a wave of evictions, Congress and both the Trump and Biden administrations implemented a series of eviction moratoriums. These federal protections—alongside similar efforts at the state and local level—drove eviction filings down significantly. In 2020 alone, an estimated 1.55 million fewer evictions were filed compared to a typical year. But the moratoriums were not without controversy or consequences. Several federal actions faced legal challenges. Meanwhile, extended nonpayment of rent increased financial pressure on landlords, complicated efforts to evict tenants for reasons other than nonpayment and contributed to significant court backlogs. Emergency Rental Assistance: Although federal eviction moratoriums helped keep many renters in their homes, they did not prevent the accrual of rental arrears, provide financial assistance to struggling renters, or support landlords saddled with the resulting rent nonpayment. To address the financial challenges that renters and landlords across the country were experiencing, Congress created the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program. Administered by the Treasury Department, ERA provided direct cash assistance to renters and landlords to assist with rent, utilities, and other housing-related expenses. As the first nationwide emergency rental assistance program, ERA took substantial time and&hellip;",

    "content": "On April 30, 2025, the bipartisan House Paid Family Leave Working Group introduced two bills that would expand and improve access to paid family leave benefits: The More Paid Leave for More Americans Act incentivizes states, through a competitive grant program, to establish paid family leave programs using a public-private partnership model. The Interstate Paid Family Leave Action Network (I-PLAN) Act establishes a convening body and process to encourage state collaboration, align administrative and statutory policies, and facilitate the sharing of best practices on paid leave. These pragmatic bills address critical barriers to paid family leave access. In the absence of a national paid parental leave policy, states have taken the lead, but uneven access, complex compliance burdens for multistate employers, and financial barriers for implementation persist. A competitive grant program will incentivize increased state provision of paid family leave. By promoting public-private partnerships, the grants ensure that states leverage the best of both worlds. Public involvement can help expand access to paid leave, set minimum standards, and ensure oversight, while private sector participation can drive innovation and support efficient program administration. Meanwhile, the absence of uniform standards across states has led to a complex patchwork of laws, with programs differing across nearly 30 policy elements. For multistate employers, this creates a significant challenge—navigating varied state requirements while trying to provide consistent leave benefits to employees nationwide. The I-PLAN Act tackles this issue head-on by helping coordinate and harmonize paid leave benefits across states. Together, these bipartisan proposals would help close gaps in access, reduce compliance costs, and ensure that more families, regardless of their job, income level, or location, have the stability they need to thrive. Key provisions include: &nbsp; More Paid Leave for More Americans Act Incentivizes Public-Private Partnerships through a Competitive Grant Program: States that have enacted a law establishing a paid family leave program, based on a public-private partnership model and providing at least six weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child, can apply for a competitive grant award between $1.5 million and $7 million, administered by the U.S. secretary of labor. These grants support implementation, including start-up costs, outreach and marketing, benefit payments, and research to improve program design and accessibility. Promotes State Harmonization Through Eligibility Requirements: To be eligible, states must participate in the Interstate Paid Leave Action Network (I-PLAN), a coordination effort to align administrative and statutory policies across states. The grant program thus promotes both greater harmonization and expanded access to paid family leave. Prioritizes States with High Need and Sustainable Financing Plans: Priority is given to states with a lower share of workers who currently have access to paid family leave and to those that demonstrate how their program will serve low-income populations. States with plans to finance their programs without long-term reliance on federal funds will also receive higher priority.  Includes Strong Oversight and Accountability Measures: States must submit annual reports to the secretary of labor detailing how grant funds are used and the impact&hellip;",

    "content": "April is National Child Abuse Prevention Month, a time to raise awareness and promote actions that strengthen families and prevent abuse and neglect. To underscore this national priority, the Bipartisan Policy Center released four new publications that explore the complex issue of child neglect with a special focus on the challenges of differentiating poverty from neglect. State and federal policymakers seek to protect children without unnecessarily involving families in the child welfare system. But with limited guidance from federal law, states have wide discretion in how they define and respond to child neglect. These definitions influence critical decisions, including whether a child protection agency will investigate a report or intervene in a family’s life. Those decisions can in turn have significant impacts on family stability, a child’s educational experience, and their broader developmental path. As policymakers consider reforms, this new research aims to provide clarity, data, and analysis to guide these efforts and help shape evidence-based policy. In particular, this new research is timely and useful to state child welfare program leaders who are required by recently enacted federal law to ensure state policies are in place to prevent the separation of children from their families solely due to poverty. This provision was championed by Reps. Jason Smith (R-MO) and Gwen Moore (D-WI) who co-sponsored the Preventing Child Welfare Entry Caused by Poverty Act, H.R. 8813, which was included in the final passage of Title IV-B reauthorization. BPC’s Child Welfare Initiative (CWI) develops thoughtful, bipartisan policies that both safeguard children and support families. The CWI is part of our broader Human Capital program, which works to ensure every American has the knowledge, skills, and supports they need to access their full potential. Our landscape assessments consistently show strong bipartisan interest from policymakers in improving the &#8220;front end&#8221; of the child welfare system, especially when it comes to preventing unnecessary family separation and re-examining how neglect is defined. In the coming months, the Child Welfare Initiative will host webinars, briefings, and policy convenings to facilitate deeper dialogue about neglect, the impact of poverty, and opportunities for state and federal leadership.

    "content": "In a deeply polarized political environment, finding consensus on pressing policy challenges can feel difficult or outright impossible. But the Bipartisan Policy Center stands out in its approach by working across the full political spectrum and engaging diverse perspectives to craft durable policy solutions. Bipartisan cooperation is not only possible but essential for crafting durable policy solutions. That’s why in 2018, BPC launched our American Congressional Exchange (ACE), a first-of-its-kind program that fosters mutual understanding and strengthens cooperation by pairing members of Congress from different parties to visit each other&#8217;s districts. With over 50 trips completed since 2018, ACE creates invaluable opportunities for policymakers to step outside of Washington, engage directly with leaders across diverse communities, identify shared challenges and goals, and build meaningful relationships across the aisle. The first American Congressional Exchange visits of 2025 brought together Representatives Mike Carey (R-OH) and Brad Schneider (D-IL), both members of the powerful House Ways &amp; Means Committee, to explore how investments in workforce development, advanced manufacturing, and healthcare innovation are preparing communities for long-term success in both of their midwestern districts. A Shared Vision for Workforce Development A central theme of both trips was the urgent need to prepare America’s workforce for the next generation of jobs, which is a core focus of BPC’s recently launched Human Capital Initiative. Both central Ohio and northeast Illinois are investing heavily in education and vocational training to ensure their communities are prepared for success in expanding industries. These efforts were on display as the representatives visited career and technical education centers and heard from students, educators, and business leaders. In Ohio, public-private partnerships are helping to rapidly scale workforce training across the state, particularly in skilled and high-tech trades. Industry leaders are working with schools and colleges to create certificate programs that quickly prepare workers for jobs in high-tech sectors like semiconductor fabrication and electric vehicle manufacturing. Meanwhile in Illinois, efforts are underway to help students develop skills and passion for STEM as early as middle school; the policymakers saw how schools like Neal Math &amp; Science Academy in North Chicago emphasize STEM education, hands-on learning, and career readiness. Recognizing the critical role of workforce readiness for growth and sustainability in specialized industries, local employers are also investing directly in these education initiatives and vocational training programs. These visits revealed a shared understanding: whether in suburban Illinois or central Ohio, long-term success depends on a well-trained, adaptable workforce.

    "content": "A baby bonus—a direct cash payment to parents shortly after welcoming a new child—has garnered increased bipartisan attention.  The Trump administration is actively considering the idea, and with reconciliation negotiations underway, policymakers might seriously attempt to make it a reality.   One thing is clear: the costs of raising children are high and families are struggling to keep up. In America—as in much of the developed world—birth rates are declining, which could have major implications for the labor market and long-term economic growth. While shifting assumptions around work and family are a major factor, research suggests that some people are having fewer children primarily due to financial concerns and insufficient access to child care or paid leave.   Given these barriers, it makes sense that policymakers will want to consider a number of solutions to help families thrive. This type of potential baby bonus provides just one solution for families with new children; however, establishing one does come with trade-offs in the short and long term that policymakers shouldn’t overlook.   Bipartisan Momentum for a Baby Bonus  Perhaps the most appealing benefit of a baby bonus is that the money is fungible: It could help cover medical expenses, groceries, baby supplies, time off work, or even child care. Other countries have designed and implemented baby bonuses to help support parents, which can inform policy development in the U.S. While this intervention could improve family financial security, some experts have also suggested that it might boost fertility as a reason to implement the policy. The evidence here is tenuous at best and leads to serious questions around whether the federal government should be in the business of directly incentivizing birth.   Nonetheless, a baby bonus, if well-designed, can be an effective way to provide targeted support to families with the flexibility to use it to meet their unique needs. There is not one way to design a baby bonus. Most often, baby bonuses have targeted newborns specifically, providing a boost to families with children 0-1 years of age.   In the U.S., while policymakers could look to create a new program to deliver the benefit, they have primarily proposed distributing this benefit through the tax code via the Child Tax Credit (CTC). In 2019, Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) first proposed this by allowing families to pull forward future CTC dollars immediately after welcoming a new child. During the 2024 presidential campaign, then-Vice President Harris and then-Senator Vance proposed a much larger CTC, with Harris specifically including a bonus credit in the year of the child’s birth. Both Democrats and Republicans have also recently introduced legislation to build a baby bonus into the CTC, though differences remain on the size of the bonus, structure, and how to pay for it.   Weighing the Trade-Offs  The ultimate size and scope of a baby bonus will be extremely important, and the money to pay for it must come from somewhere. With high annual deficits and a national debt topping $36 trillion and&hellip;",

    "content": "The American people as a collective hold vast potential for success. Individuals have the capacity to amass the skills and knowledge necessary to excel and achieve economic opportunity—otherwise known as human capital. Wide-spread investments in human capital are critical to building and maintaining a successful workforce and a stable national economy. Nevertheless, many individuals struggle to acquire and fully develop these critical skills due to a lack of supports available to them. Access to high-quality child care and early learning lays the groundwork for human capital attainment on two fronts: it is the foundation on which children shape their educational and social experiences, and it is necessary for many working parents to participate in the workforce. The Human Capital Challenge The collective skills, knowledge, and experience of the American people are our country’s most valuable asset. But for many, opportunities to invest in their development are few and far between. This is because America has a human capital problem. People feel burdened by high costs of living, let down by underperforming institutions, and overlooked by partisan policy gaps. Without access to the economic opportunities that human capital growth affords them, many people—especially people with children—struggle to maintain competitiveness in the workforce. To learn more about how BPC views America’s human capital problem, check out the first blog in this series: The Human Capital Challenge. An efficient, accessible child care system has the potential to both support young children in positive development (thus advancing our future workforce) and support the working parents in our current workforce. Parents with young children require support to care for their children while they work, attend university, or participate in career and technical training—core pathways for economic mobility. Yet a BPC-Artemis survey found 50% of nonworking women cite caregiving challenges as the main reason they left the workforce. Young children benefit from quality child care programming that supports the development of skills needed for school and life. Unfortunately, infant and young toddler care costs are becoming increasingly untenable for families, and only an estimated 47% of three- and four-year olds are enrolled in pre-kindergarten. High-quality Early Learning is the Foundation for Young Children The first five years of a child’s life set the foundation for future development and learning. Therefore, it is crucial young children have access to an environment that supports early brain development and the development of positive social behavior. High-quality child care and early learning programs provide developmentally appropriate, enriching experiences for young children. There is considerable research demonstrating the short- and long-term benefits of child care and early learning. When children consistently attend an early learning program prior to entry into the K-12 system, they are more likely to demonstrate higher rates of academic acuity and positive learning behaviors than children who did not attend a program on a regular basis, or at all. This is because children who attend quality child care and early learning programs often participate in activities that aid the development of cognitive skills and boost specific pre-academic&hellip;",

    "content": "Earlier this year, BPC’s Human Capital Program launched the Commission on the American Workforce, bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders to craft a bipartisan blueprint to address the nation’s growing education and workforce challenges. The resulting recommendations will focus on ensuring every American has access to economic opportunity, building a workforce for the future, and nurturing the talent necessary to remain a global leader.   In February, the commission and four working groups individually convened to lay the foundation for their work for the year, diving deeply into education and labor market data to understand the current landscape. The data made clear that education is falling short, as too many students still cannot read or do math at grade level. Similarly, demographic transitions and technological changes are transforming the future of work, but postsecondary and workforce systems are not agile enough to meet these needs.   Policymakers need to put everyday Americans&#8211;students, workers, and families&#8211;at the center of conversations to ensure we find solutions that allow everyone to thrive. The commission’s work will continue to interrogate the purpose of our education and workforce systems to enhance the nation’s human capital. The need is urgent and the moment is now.   Time for Bold, Transformational Solutions  It’s not all doom and gloom. Conversations were optimistic, and the data showed some bright spots: over 100 districts outperformed their pre-pandemic reading and math scores. This optimism has highlighted the need for intentional investment in these systems, and BPC’s Commission on the American Workforce was created to fill this policy vacuum, to come together on issues that matter, and to identify actionable solutions that address the nation’s human capital challenges. Specifically, there was a sense that real progress was only possible when some degree of bipartisanship was achieved, and this group of experts is up to the task, focused on a shared belief that there is a federal role in our American education and workforce strategy.  Alongside bipartisanship, commissioners made clear that bold, transformational policy solutions should emerge from their work, putting the U.S. on a new path to prosperity with improved education and workforce outcomes. Piecemeal reforms to current systems are insufficient, and the commission should not be afraid to set forth innovative frameworks with a new vision for human capital development from birth to retirement.   Following initial discussions, three broad themes emerged across these issues that will continue to evolve as conversations progress.  Defining the Federal Role   In recent weeks, it has become clear that the role of the federal government is under scrutiny, especially when it comes to involvement in education and workforce development systems across the country. As conversations around the federal role continue to evolve, the balance between federal guidance and state leadership needs to be right-sized to make needed policy changes throughout the human capital pipeline.   There is a difference between specific state responsibilities and states filling policy gaps due to a void in federal action. State innovation is crucial for testing new ideas that can be more widely adopted&hellip;",

    "content": "America faces a looming tidal wave of student loan delinquencies and defaults. As of September 2024, nearly 10 million student loan borrowers were delinquent. These borrowers are now seeing a hit to their credit scores. If their loans fall into default—when they miss 270 days’ worth of payments—they will be subject to collections (potentially including wage garnishments) and could take years to restore their financial health.   Faltering payments highlight longstanding problems in the student loan system that threaten borrowers, taxpayers, and the broader economy. Policymaking around the student loan system, however, has become highly partisan, with executive action and litigation repeatedly reshaping the terms of repayment. The Biden administration’s attempts at student loan forgiveness and a more generous income-driven repayment (IDR) plan were stopped by lawsuits, while the Trump administration has initiated rulemaking to make changes to two other IDR plans.   The constantly changing political pendulum in Washington, DC has led to widespread confusion among borrowers and unpredictability surrounding repayment terms. The looming threat of widespread default highlights the need for bipartisan legislative action to restore the health of the student loan system and ensure borrowers have clear pathways to repayment.   How Did We Get Here?   From March 2020 to September 2023, the federal government paused student loan payments as part of COVID-19 relief efforts. As pandemic forbearance has ended, borrowers must again repay their student loans and if they do not, they risk delinquency and default.  According to the New York Fed, nearly 10 million borrowers with a total of $250 billion in student loans were 30 days or more behind in payment at the end of the return to repayment “on-ramp” in September in 2024. Delinquency rates at that point already exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the American Enterprise Institute reports more recent data from servicers showing delinquency rates continuing to rise.   These figures reflect longstanding problems in the student loan system, as well as challenges related to college costs and student outcomes. For two decades, rising levels of borrowing, high rates of noncompletion, and poor labor market outcomes for some students have led to a growing student loan challenge, as a sizeable minority of loan borrowers struggle to repay their debts. They also stem from inconsistent policy interventions that have created confusion and uncertainty for borrowers regarding their pending payments.   In recent years, student loan borrowers have faced a constantly changing repayment landscape. In response to the economic disruptions from the pandemic, Congress suspended student loan payments and interest accumulation in March 2020 through September 2020 as part of the CARES Act. The Department of Education repeatedly extended the suspension, until the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 mandated a return to repayment. The student loan payment suspension ended on September 1, 2023, with a 1-year on-ramp period during which borrowers were not reported as delinquent after missing payments.   The return to repayment has been rocky. Surveys in summer 2023 found that less than a third of borrowers knew payments were set to resume. After repeated&hellip;",

    "content": "American taxpayers face growing costs from the federal student loan program: Between 2000 and 2024, the size of the loan portfolio quadrupled from about $400 billion to over $1.6 trillion (in current dollars). Although enrolling in higher education continues to benefit most students, millions of borrowers struggle to repay their student loans, leaving taxpayers to bear a significant part of the cost.  Congress could reform the student loan program—which has proven significantly more expensive than once estimated—to substantially reduce costs while better protecting taxpayers and students from the consequences of excessive borrowing and better targeting relief to the borrowers who need it the most.  A range of policy options under consideration could save taxpayers more than $300 billion over the next 10 years and support better outcomes for students and borrowers. Options discussed below include: streamlining and better targeting income-driven repayment (IDR), capping graduate borrowing, reforming Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), and expanding accountability for programs participating in the federal loan program. Many of these include elements that have received bipartisan support, and some have been offered by members of the Senate and House education committees.   Reforming Income-Driven Repayment  The Biden administration’s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) IDR plan, rolled out in 2023, is extremely expensive (potentially costing over $400 billion over 10 years) and not well targeted. It is also now subject to court injunctions and may never reach full implementation. Replacing SAVE with an option based on existing legislative proposals would yield substantial savings for taxpayers and provide relief and certainty to borrowers.  Existing proposals show that several changes to IDR have received bipartisan support, including:  Simplifying the existing maze of IDR options by directing borrowers to a single plan.  Automatically enrolling borrowers into IDR when they fall into delinquency.   Eliminating interest capitalization.  Providing scaled forgiveness for low-balance undergraduates loans, which would help target relief to the low-income, low-balance student loan borrowers who are most likely to struggle with repayment and to default on their loans.   Eliminating the standard repayment cap, which is an important step for avoiding excessive IDR forgiveness.   For example, the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that an approach along these lines could cost $276 billion less than SAVE over 10 years. One drawback to the scaled forgiveness component is that it reduces the potential savings from the plan. Legislators could alternatively or additionally introduce a progressive payment formula to IDR so that high-income borrowers pay a higher percentage of their income, while lower-income borrowers get greater relief. This could be structured either in a cost-neutral way or with rates that generate additional savings.   Loan Limits for Graduate Borrowers  Although graduate borrowers account for only 21% of all borrowers, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that they will account for more than half of the projected cost of new federal student loans over the next 10 years. Uncapped graduate loans have contributed to rising tuition prices at the graduate level and excessive borrowing for programs that do not provide adequate labor market outcomes.  There&hellip;",

    "content": "In 2022, Congress made important changes to how utilities and developers of clean energy and advanced manufacturing projects can monetize the value of tax credits their projects are eligible for. As Congress discusses extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there is growing interest in reexamining energy tax credit provisions, including both direct pay and transferability. Energy tax credits support energy projects by lowering the developer’s tax burden. However, tax credits don’t provide any direct benefit to entities without a tax liability, such as startups, local governments, and electric cooperatives. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act becoming law in 2022, the only way for such entities to monetize energy tax credits was through tax equity transactions. This form of project financing allows developers to “sell” tax credits to an investor with a large tax liability in exchange for cash and an ownership stake in the project. This process, however, has proven costly and cumbersome, requiring complicated ownership structures. Direct pay (also known as elective pay) and transferability were designed as two solutions to this problem. These provisions enable efficient deployment of energy tax credits, provide support for innovative technologies, and extend the benefits of the tax credits to local governments, rural electric co-ops, non-profits and other entities that previously were unable to benefit from the credits. This blog post will explain how transferability and direct pay work and why they are beneficial for American energy. Transferability  What is it? Transferability is a mechanism that allows entities to transfer all or a portion of a tax credit to a third-party buyer in exchange for cash. Why is it good for American energy?  More money goes into innovative energy technologies instead of transaction fees.   Past tax equity markets were shallow—only a few large entities had a tax liability large enough to make such complicated transactions worthwhile. Today, transferability permits the sale of tax credits to a party that does not need to take an ownership stake in the project, meaning a larger market exists for these credits. This has led to a higher value for credits than within tax equity markets due to simpler transactions and a larger pool of investors. Tax equity transactions require costly fees for due diligence and accounting, resulting in some projects losing at least 15% of the value of the tax credits In contrast, transferability allows developers to sell credits for cash while retaining ownership over the project. Tax transfer pricing averages 92.5 cents for investment tax credit (ITC) deals and 95 cents for productions tax credit (PTC) deals, resulting in only 5-7.5% of the value of credits, on average, going to transaction costs. Transferability allows for a greater share of the tax credit to go directly to the project developer. This lowers the costs of energy production while simultaneously reducing energy costs for consumers. Advanced technologies are benefiting the most. According to Crux, a capital markets platform focused on sustainable energy, emerging technologies including advanced manufacturing; nuclear; bioenergy; geothermal; and carbon capture, utilization, and storage&hellip;",

Heidi Heitkamp and Mel Martinez, the Working Group includes former elected officials, congressional staff, regulators, and other experts. Charged with examining implications for Congress arising from a series of Supreme Court decisions, the Working Group spent six months conferring with policymakers and legal scholars, among others. The Working Group released its report and recommendations in March 2025 during a public event. This blog post includes key highlights and takeaways from that event and provides important insight into the Working Group’s process, recommendations, and mission moving forward. As ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, Rep. Morelle has worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to identify steps Congress can take to modernize its processes and operations. In his remarks, Rep. Morelle spoke about what he learned as a state legislator, his reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, and how Congress must invest in itself to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. “It’s vital for our appropriators to understand that the failure to invest in Congress will hinder our ability. … So, I’m going to continue to fight for funding in the legislative branch, and to make sure that the Office of Legislative Counsel, Congressional Research Service, Government Publishing Office, and others have the resources to do their job. … I’m going to make it my mission to ensure Congress has both the authority and capacity to hire more technical staff and legislative counsel.” — Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY) Rep. Morelle concluded his remarks by noting that Congress must have “the expertise, the time, the capacity, the patience” to fulfill its Article I responsibilities. In a conversation about the Working Group’s report, co-chairs Heitkamp and Martinez talked about its recommendations, their experience in the Senate, and how they see the relationship between the legislative and executive branches evolving. “ is a wake-up call for the United States Congress to do their job … because regular order is broken. Regular order is where you make much more complex, detailed decisions on complex, detailed issues and where you debate. What people don’t appreciate is that when you don’t have that debate, the public never sees why these decisions were made the way they were made. There is no public exploring or public airing of the dialogue. … When we talked about it in the Working Group, we said, what is the lack of capacity. We need to build the expertise back up, and the resources back up of Congress to do their job.” — Co-Chair Heidi Heitkamp “It falls back upon the Congress to be more precise and demand more of itself in the way that it legislates so it leaves less room for there to be prerogatives exercised by the executive branch in ways that it was not ever intended.” — Co-Chair Mel Martinez In a conversation moderated by Matthew Schwartz,&hellip;",

    "content": "At the end of 2025, several tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) expire. With policymakers in both parties poised to push for extensions to significant parts of those laws, a new report from the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) demonstrates just how much of a challenge this cliff poses to the nation’s already daunting budget trajectory. JCT finds that extending individual and estate tax provisions of TCJA—along with the revival of business tax provisions affected by TCJA—would increase deficits by more than $4 trillion from fiscal years 2025 through 2034, adding to the rising pile of debt.    TCJA The bulk of these costs come from extending the individual income tax cuts in TCJA: Across-the-board rate cuts (+$2.1 trillion in deficits); Limiting the reach of the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) (+$1.4 trillion); Doubling the standard deduction (+$1.2 trillion); and Doubling the Child Tax Credit (CTC) (+$693 billion). TCJA included offsets that broadened the individual tax base. Specifically, the provisions that would raise revenue (and thereby decrease deficits) if extended are: Repealing personal exemptions (-$1.9 trillion); and Limiting itemized deductions like the state and local tax (SALT) deduction and the mortgage interest deduction (-$1.1 trillion). But even extending these offsets with the tax cut extensions outlined above would blow a multi-trillion-dollar hole in the deficit. Technical Factors While the $4 trillion cost outlined by JCT is extraordinary, technical factors could push the overall cost for extension even higher. Between now and a possible resolution of the December 31, 2025, tax expirations, the first fiscal year in CBO’s 10-year window—FY2025—will come and go. A one-year shift in the 10-year window—from FY2025 through FY2034 to FY2026 through FY2035—increases the cost of tax cut extensions from $4.1 trillion to $4.5 trillion, particularly because the extension costs very little in FY2025 (which ends on September 30, 2025). Further, if higher inflation, interest rates, and Treasury borrowing costs persist, the debt service impacts of tax cut extensions will also increase. The $4 trillion estimate should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling, as policymakers grapple with the cost of extension next year. The Need for Offsets All of these factors—the baseline cost for tax cut extensions, the political pressure for further tax cut expansion, and the technical factors that could raise the cost of extension higher—point to the urgent need for policymakers in both parties to begin proposing offsets for next year’s tax cut debate. A combination of four approaches may be needed: Letting some TCJA tax cuts expire; Broadening the reach of offsets included in TCJA to raise more revenue than under a simple extension; Proposing new revenue offsets; and Proposing offsets on the spending side of the government ledger. Dynamic scoring—a method of estimating the cost of legislation that includes macroeconomic feedback from changes to tax or spending laws—can reduce the deficit impact for some tax cuts, but cannot fully offset the budget impact of those tax cuts either.

    "content": "Homeowners across the United States are increasingly aware of rising property insurance costs. In a recent white paper, the J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy discussed the drivers and impacts of property insurance rate increases and outlined several policy options to address these challenges. Amid rising property insurance rates, homeowners are also battling the risks posed by natural disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and hailstorms. Hazard mitigation measures can help homeowners protect their homes from destruction, but it is not always clear whether mitigation efforts will lead to lower property insurance costs. As property insurance rates rise, can homeowners expect premium reductions for fortifying their properties? Increasing Disaster Risk In 2024 alone, there were 27 weather and climate events that caused at least $1 billion in damage each, collectively claiming over 560 lives and forever altering countless others. These costly climate-related disasters are becoming more common and pose a significant risk to the U.S. housing stock. For example, over 30 million homes face wildfire risk, 32 million homes are vulnerable to hurricane wind damage, and nearly 15 million homes have substantial flood risk. As discussed in a previous blog post, the increasing level of extreme weather and climate-related risk translates to higher property insurance premiums. Insurers are raising rates to stay profitable and ensure they have sufficient resources to cover future customer losses. Homeowners insurance rates have effectively increased by an average of 24% over the past two years, with 33 states seeing double-digit increases in 2024 alone. Average homeowners insurance premiums vary widely by region, but can reach as high as $450 per month. When coupled with rising property taxes, maintenance costs, and other household expenses, these higher insurance premiums make homeownership less affordable for millions of households already struggling to meet mortgage payments. Costs and Benefits of Hazard Mitigation Measures Hail resistant roofing Hurricane shutters Seismic retrofitting Hazard mitigation measures, such as storm-resistant roofing and seismic retrofitting, can reduce the likelihood of significant home damage and save money in prevented future losses. For example, home retrofits to increase earthquake resilience can save up to $13 for every $1 invested, while retrofits to withstand high wind speeds save up to $6 per $1 invested. Despite the potential savings, some hazard mitigation measures can be too costly upfront for homeowners to undertake on their own. According to 2018 estimates, roofing and vents with wildfire-resistant features typically cost more than $5,800, while the cost of retrofitting an existing roof to be wildfire-resistant can exceed $22,000. The cost of hazard mitigation projects varies widely depending on factors such as property size and location, materials, and contractors. For instance, installing hurricane shutters (including labor) can cost anywhere from $13,000 to over $19,000. The Relationship Between Hazard Mitigation and Property Insurance Premiums In theory, the logic behind investing in hazard mitigation is straightforward: homes less likely to suffer damage from natural disasters should cost less to insure. If insurers can reduce the risk of expensive claims, premiums should drop accordingly. However, the&hellip;",

    "content": "Increasing skepticism of the value of 4-year college degrees and interest in faster, more affordable educational pathways have fueled growth in nondegree credentials, including short-term certificates, industry certifications, and microcredentials like badges. States have responded with investments in alternative credential pathways and varying strategies to direct learners and dollars toward quality nondegree programs. To better understand the state policy landscape around short-term credentials, BPC brought together state policymakers, system leaders, and experts last October for a virtual roundtable conversation on how states are working to define quality nondegree credentials and identify which short-term credentials provide value. This blog summarizes key lessons learned from that conversation. There is already bipartisan interest in Workforce Pell Grants, which would expand Pell Grants to programs under 15 weeks in length. State efforts to define and identify quality nondegree credentials hold insight into other ways that federal policymakers can help ensure that learners seeking alternative educational pathways have access to credentials of value. Nondegree Credentials The past two decades have witnessed significant growth in short-term and nondegree credentials. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of certificates below associate degrees awarded by community colleges increased by 30%. In Fall 2024, undergraduate enrollment in certificate programs increased by nearly 10%, compared to a 5% increase in undergraduate enrollment overall. Outcomes for nondegree credentials are, however, mixed and the value of short-term credentials can vary significantly by field, geography, and learner population. Short-term credentials appear, on average, to produce modest increases in earnings—smaller than those of longer-term certificates and degree programs—that may disappear over time. Short-term certificates in some occupational fields produce negative returns. In other fields, certificates show positive returns and can lead to significant increases in earnings. Learners generally receive larger earnings gains when they stack credentials as part of a career pathway, but rates of stacking vary by state, field, and learner demographics. State Actions to Define and Identify Short Term Credentials of Value In recent years, states have made major strategic investments in short-term credential pathways. As of late 2024, 32 states had invested more than $5.6 billion across 70 short-term credential initiatives. Most of these initiatives provide financial aid to students pursuing short-term certificates or certifications, while others focus on boosting institutional capacity to meet demand for shorter term programs. States have adopted varying approaches to quality assurance for nondegree credentials, including looking at labor-market relevance, industry recognition, earnings, return on investment, stackability, and accessibility. Most states investing in short-term credentials require that they be in high-demand areas or achieve specified wage standards. Some states have adopted more advanced value frameworks that include clearer definitions and more comprehensive consideration of value. The North Carolina Workforce Credentials Initiative, for example, is a cross-sector collaboration that reviews and categorizes credentials submitted by community colleges and employers based on whether they lead to family-sustaining wages and employment in high-demand, high-growth fields. Only programs that the North Carolina Workforce Credentials Advisory Council certifies as leading to employment in high-growth fields that pay family-sustaining wages are eligible for&hellip;",

However, the debate so far has largely overlooked a critical component to fiscally responsible tax reform, and one that’s consistent with the spirit, letter, and vision of TCJA: revenue raisers.  Lawmakers often call TCJA a $1.5 trillion tax cut, which is true overall. But really, it was a $5.5 trillion cut paired with a $4 trillion increase.  TCJA was a $5.5 Trillion Tax Cut…  TCJA was a $5.5 trillion gross tax cut, comprised of changes to over two dozen different provisions.

    "content": "“Quite simply, our investments in human capital have failed to keep up with our capital investments elsewhere.” The United States is home to the most innovative technology companies, the largest economy, and the leading universities. Our advancements in artificial intelligence, space exploration, and biotechnology are shaping the future. Yet, when it comes to supporting workers and families, we lag behind. If you have a baby, job protection is a coin flip. Access to paid leave to care for a sick loved one is even rarer. The U.S. is the only OECD country—and one of just six in the world—without a national paid parental leave policy. Quite simply, our investments in human capital have failed to keep up with our capital investments elsewhere. Addressing this failure is the purpose of BPC’s new Commission on the American Workforce &#8211; a bold initiative to develop a national, bipartisan strategy to strengthen the workforce, expand economic opportunity, and ensure the United States remains competitive. Here we will focus on one aspect of our Human Capital challenge: caregiving. &nbsp; The Cost of Underinvestment The costs of our underinvestment in caregiving are numerous and well-known. America is experiencing declining fertility rates, worsening maternal health outcomes, and businesses are struggling to attract and retain workers in part due to inadequate access to paid leave and other critical benefits for family members. BPC’s 2023 polling, conducted in partnership with Artemis Strategy Group, found that caregiving responsibilities were the leading reason prime-age adults were out of the labor force (neither working nor looking for work). 37% of respondents cited caregiving as their main reason for not working—33% for children and 3% for other family members. Notably, respondents ranked paid family and medical leave about as important as compensation when deciding whether to start or return to work. According to Pew Research data, mothers without access to paid leave from their employers are likely to cut their leave short, go on public assistance, take on debt, or fall behind on bills, creating a spiral of economic challenges. The Center for American Progress estimates that workers and their families miss out on $22.5 billion in wages each year as a lack of paid leave forces workers to take unpaid time off, reduce hours, or leave their job. Infants whose parents have access to paid parental leave exhibit higher brain activity and better health outcomes, including higher vaccination rates, breastfeeding rates, and reduced neonatal fatality rates. At the same time, BPC Action polling, in partnership with Pivotal Ventures and Morning Consult, finds that many caregivers suffer income or job loss to care for ill or aging family members—a challenge that will only intensify as the population ages. &nbsp; Mind the Gap Fortunately, there have been many improvements in paid leave coverage in recent years, both public and private. The percentage of private industry workers with access to paid family leave through their employer has more than doubled, from 13% in 2017 to 27% in 2023. In the same period, the increase among&hellip;",

    "content": "In recent years, states and colleges have launched a range of initiatives to re-engage individuals who enrolled in college but never completed a degree. As of 2022, there were nearly 37 million Americans under 65 who have earned some college credit but not a degree. These adult learners are increasingly central to states’ strategies for meeting postsecondary attainment goals and addressing growing workforce gaps. To better understand the state policy landscape around returning and adult learners, BPC brought together state policymakers, system leaders, and experts for a virtual roundtable conversation in October 2024 on how states and institutions are working to engage and re-enroll these learners. This blog summarizes key lessons learned from the conversation. As the United States faces a growing human capital challenge, state efforts around adult reengagement show how state and federal policymakers can build more pathways for adults to develop skills over the course of their careers and attain the credentials they need for upward mobility. Why Re-Engaging Adult Learners Matters Last year, BPC partnered with ReUp Education, an organization that specializes in re-engaging adult learners, on blogs discussing why re-enrollment of adult learners matters and how states and institutions can empower adult students to complete college. For states facing a shrinking population of young adults and mismatch between existing skills and labor market demand, upskilling adult learners can help address skills gaps and keep industries competitive. For adult learners, returning to college is a pathway to better-paying jobs and a chance of realizing higher education’s promise of economic mobility. Several states have implemented policies designed to support returning learners or encourage institutions to better serve the adult learner population. The Tennessee Reconnect program, for example, provides returning adult learners with financial aid so they can attend community college tuition-free. Michigan Reconnect and the Missouri Fast Track Workforce Incentive Grant provide financial aid for state residents over age 25 to enroll in high-demand fields, while Massachusetts offers free community college for learners over age 25. Other states, like Texas and Indiana, include metrics for enrolling and successfully serving adult learners within performance-based funding formulas. Key Lessons from State Initiatives Fewer than 3% of some credit, no credential learners re-enrolled in 2022-23. Adult learners face a range of challenges that can prevent them from returning to higher education. State initiatives around these learners have tended to focus on making a return to school more affordable. Supporting adult learners at greater scale, however, requires also addressing institutional barriers. Roundtable participants observed that institutions’ approach to serving adult learners has tended to be, “If they come, we will build it.” As a result, adult learners looking to return to college often face a postsecondary system that is not designed to meet their needs. Participants identified key steps that institutions and states can take to better reengage adult learners and support their return: Institutions have typically focused re-engagement efforts on their own former students and on the small subset of some credit, no credential learners who are close to completion.&hellip;",

    "content": "What do election officials do in between presidential elections? A lot more than many realize. Our new data shows that local election officials oversee multiple elections each year—far more than just federal and statewide contests. This analysis explores how many elections local officials administer annually and examines South Carolina as a case study for election consolidation, a policy that could reduce their workload by merging election dates. We show that: The average election official administers 2.1 elections each year. Frequent elections contribute to voter fatigue and increase administrative burdens for election officials. Merging local and special elections with existing state and federal contests could reduce the number of elections South Carolina’s election works administer each year by 41%. How Many Elections Does a Typical Local Election Official Administer Each Year? The United States is an outlier in both the frequency and complexity of its elections. Unlike most countries where federal elections occur every few years, U.S. voters cast ballots at multiple levels of government—federal, state, county, municipal, and special jurisdictions—often in separate contests. Primary and runoff elections further add to the cycle, as do special elections to fill vacancies. The average state sees its typical chief local election official administer 2.1 elections each year. This includes 1.8 federal, state, primary, special, and runoff elections, and an additional 0.3 municipal elections. Figure 1 shows the significant discrepancy across states, with Oklahoma officials administering over four elections per year and Wyoming just one.  Figure 1: Average Number of Elections Run per Year by Local Election Officials, 2014-2020  How do Election Schedules Impact Voters and Election Officials? Academic research has long focused on the potential fatiguing effects of too many elections. If people are asked to come to the polls too often, they are less likely to show up each time, potentially leading to unrepresentative outcomes. This is especially the case when voters are tasked with voting on obscure offices and technical questions.  What has garnered less attention is the effect frequent elections have on the election officials in charge of administering them. A recent Bipartisan Policy Center report found that turnover among election officials has been growing over the past two decades, increasing from 28% in 2004 to 39% in 2022, a 38% increase. One of the major reasons for this increase identified by the report was the increasing demands of the job over the past two decades, especially the growing complexity of administering each individual election. Each election, officials are typically expected to update lists of eligible registered voters, select polling locations, recruit and train poll workers, program and test voting equipment, verify candidates’ eligibility, write and print ballots, distribute resources to polling locations, communicate dates and voting rules to voters, ensure candidate compliance with electioneering and campaign finance laws, oversee Election Day voting, and tabulate and certify election results. Election officials also must administer absentee and early in-person voting, if applicable, distribute overseas and military ballots, communicate with media, and ensure all tasks are completed within budget.

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center, The Commonwealth Fund, and the Primary Care Collaborative hosted a discussion on primary care payment challenges and potential solutions on June 18, 2024, in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. High-quality, comprehensive primary care is the cornerstone of an equitable and effective health care system. However, too many Americans lack access to the care they need because payment systems with misaligned incentives continue to underemphasize primary care and prevention. Evidence shows that enhancing primary care services improves health outcomes and lowers costs. To strengthen primary care and address the growing provider shortages, federal policymakers are considering physician payment reforms that will advance value-based primary care in Medicare. These efforts build on ongoing federal initiatives to test innovative, alternative payment models centered on accountability and care quality. Our event featured introductory remarks from BPC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anand Parekh, Primary Care Collaborative President and CEO Ann Greiner, and The Commonwealth Fund Program Officer Corinne Lewis. Following keynote remarks by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) on the bipartisan efforts in Congress to improve primary care payment in Medicare, we had a panel discussion on the issue with National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions’ Shawn Gremminger, Partnership for a Healthy Nebraska President Dr. Bob Rauner, and University of Pennsylvania Associate Professor of Medicine Dr. Matthew Press. Takeaways: The current state of primary care in the U.S. shows that primary care services are undervalued and underutilized, despite their potential to improve patient outcomes and control long-term health care costs. Panelists highlighted that primary care payment challenges contribute to the nation’s shortage of primary care providers, particularly in rural and underserved communities, limiting patients’ access to advanced, comprehensive primary care. Alternative payment models (APMs), such as accountable care organizations (ACOs), can support the delivery of advanced, comprehensive primary care by addressing some of the challenges associated with the traditional fee-for-service payment model. For example, APMs can provide greater flexibility to capture the full range of primary care services while supporting the integration of behavioral health and primary care services, as well as other clinical and operational improvements. However, startup costs, administrative burdens, and other barriers have limited providers’ participation in these promising models. Given continuing bipartisan efforts in Congress to reform Medicare physician payments, including primary care payments, panelists identified opportunities for federal action. They discussed increasing investment in primary care services to control long-term health care costs while improving measurement and reporting on primary care spending. They also underscored the need to more appropriately value primary care services within the physician fee schedule, such as by implementing hybrid payments that combine capitated and fee-for-service payments for primary care services. Other suggested reforms included reducing administrative burden on providers and addressing additional barriers to providers’ participation in population-based payment models.",

    "content": "Access to child care and other pro-family supports have long been understood to impact female workforce participation. Close to half of America’s workforce is female and one-third of those women are working mothers with children under 18. Working mothers play a critical role in the economic and social development of our country and help to support the continued success of our labor market participation and robust national economy. This International Women’s Day, BPC is celebrating women in the workforce by highlighting the important role that child care plays in enabling mothers to gain and maintain meaningful employment. To support working mothers and boost our national workforce, a combination of bipartisan policies and innovative private solutions to child care is needed. Women in the Workplace Women have always worked, both inside and outside the home. While female labor force participation had been steadily increasing since the end of World War II, it wasn’t until the 1970s that the U.S. began to see a large uptick in female employment, due in part to the significant increase in the number of married women entering the workforce. Several factors contributed to the rise of female employment, including increased access to education and a growing need to fill clerical and office jobs. As the number of married women employed continued to grow throughout the 20th century so did the number of working mothers. Approximately 15 million children in America live in households where all available parents work. For many mothers, participation in the workforce is contingent on child care access. A BPC-Artemis survey of non-working prime-age adults found that 48% of women cite caring for children as the primary reason for not being in the workforce. While this is an intentional choice for some women, challenges in accessing and affording child care can keep many mothers out of the workforce who may otherwise wish to be employed. Today, 74% of all mothers with children under 18 years old participate in the workforce. These women work in every imaginable career field, from education to health care to various office occupations and so on. Not only is their career a passion for many women, but it is often also an economic necessity. In the wake of a global pandemic and rapidly changing geopolitical economy, rising costs associated with everyday necessities such as housing, transportation, and food have led to many families relying on dual incomes when available. A BPC and Morning Consult poll found that many working mothers felt they could not go more than one month without pay and still meet their family’s financial needs. However, for many families with young children that require a dual income to meet basic cost of living expenses, the ability for both parents to work is constrained by a lack of access to caregiving supports. In most places across the country, public education does not start until kindergarten, when children are 5-or-6 years of age. Therefore, many families with all available parents in the workforce must rely on some form&hellip;",

    "content": "As policymakers in Washington aim to pass a tax bill before trillions of dollars in 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) policies expire on December 31, 2025, one of the fiercest debates has been over how to address the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Although many lawmakers from both parties want to raise or repeal the cap, doing so would add hundreds of billions of dollars to federal deficits. Below, we review how TCJA changed SALT and who is most affected by the present cap. We also suggest some principles for fiscally responsible SALT reform. How did the 2017 tax law affect SALT deductions? Before 2018, there was no direct limit on SALT deductions. Any federal taxpayer who itemized their deductions could fully deduct state and local income, property, and/or sales taxes. (Sales taxes were not deductible from 1987 through 2003.) The deduction reduced taxable income and, consequently, tax liability for those claiming SALT. Some high-income taxpayers who were subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) or the Pease limitation on overall itemized deductions saw their SALT deduction effectively limited by these other provisions, but there was no official SALT cap in effect. TCJA imposed an annual $10,000 limit on SALT deductions from 2018 through 2025, applied equally to individuals and married couples. SALT restrictions were part of a complex trade-off made by Republican lawmakers in 2017, which included limiting itemized deductions while simultaneously doubling the standard deduction claimed by most taxpayers. Limits on SALT, combined with other limits on itemized deductions, raised $668 billion in revenue over 10 years to offset other tax cuts in TCJA. Supporters generally argue these changes simplified tax filing for many households, broadened the tax base, and enabled policymakers to reduce tax rates. Opponents—especially members of Congress from states with a high cost of living and high tax rates like New York and California, sometimes organized as the SALT caucus—advocate for increasing or even repealing the $10,000 SALT cap. They claim that it unfairly burdens taxpayers in their states. They point to a segment of mostly upper-middle class to high-income taxpayers who experienced a net tax increase from TCJA as a result of the SALT cap. Who is affected by the SALT cap today? IRS data allows for the comparison of limited SALT deductions (i.e., those subject to the $10,000 cap) and overall SALT paid by itemizers (i.e., what SALT deductions would be if not restricted by the SALT cap or the AMT) for the approximately 10% of taxpayers itemizing post-TCJA. Without TCJA’s larger standard deduction, more taxpayers would likely itemize. The map above shows that taxpayers in New York and California are most affected by the SALT cap, accounting for 20 of the 25 congressional districts where the disparity is highest between SALT paid and limited SALT deductions. Forty of the top 50 districts are in New York, California, New Jersey, or Illinois. But in these districts and across the country, the SALT cap primarily affects taxpayers making&hellip;",

    "content": "Hard-working Americans understand that a good household budget starts with an accurate accounting of income and expenses. If a person’s income drops from $80,000 one year to $70,000 the next, they adjust their expenses accordingly to avoid or minimize debt. Although the federal budget is considerably more complex than that of a household, both should have accurate and transparent accounting at the core. As lawmakers consider tax and spending legislation in 2025 and beyond, Congress should follow longstanding precedent and use current law as the baseline for measuring the cost of legislation. Policymakers no doubt have a monumental task ahead of them. Major provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. BPC shares lawmakers’ interest in extending many of these tax cuts for workers and families. The best way to address expiring TCJA provisions and secure their pro-growth benefits is to offset extensions, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cost $4 trillion from 2025 through 2034. Whether Congress uses a current law or current policy baseline, extending the tax cuts without paying for them will require trillions of dollars in additional borrowing over the next decade and beyond. Higher deficits and debt will continue to slow private investment in the U.S., dragging down growth and making it more difficult for America to compete in the global economy. Continued historic levels of borrowing will further elevate interest rates in a time of rising costs and economic uncertainty, making it more difficult for American workers and families to afford basic expenses or pay down their debt. Furthermore, a current policy baseline may allow Congress to bypass and degrade one of its own budget rules, the Byrd Rule, which says any fast-track tax or spending legislation cannot increase the nation’s debt in years beyond the coming decade. If current policy is used, trillions of dollars in tax cuts for 2035 and beyond could be obligated without any way to pay for them, putting our nation’s finances further at risk. To date, lawmakers have uniformly used a current law baseline to measure the budgetary impacts of reconciliation legislation. Breaking this precedent and adopting a current policy baseline would open the floodgates for future congresses—regardless of party control—to increase borrowing by trillions of dollars without accurately accounting for those costs. A future Congress could increase spending by $100 billion in one year and subsequently extend that funding at $100 billion per year for nine more years but claim it costs $0 on a current policy baseline. The same approach could apply to a $100 billion per year tax cut. The additional debt required is the same under either baseline, but breaking the precedent now makes it easier for both parties to add significantly to the debt for decades to come. Lawmakers in both parties should keep the current law baseline as their North Star. BPC and others have achievable offset options that total trillions of dollars and would reform government spending, reduce&hellip;",

    "content": "With the looming demographic cliff, a shrinking workforce, declines in college enrollment, and a mismatch between existing skills and labor market demand, addressing gaps in the education system are critical to meeting our human capital needs. The postsecondary landscape is changing. We need new strategies for engaging an increasingly diverse population of students through traditional and non-traditional pathways to complete degrees or other credentials. Parent students—those students who are going to school while also caring for children—constitute nearly a quarter (22%) of postsecondary learners. Supporting these learners and helping them succeed in postsecondary education is critical both to meeting the country’s current and future workforce needs and to enhancing educational and economic opportunities for American families. Why Parent Students? Parent students are resilient and demonstrate a commitment to learning and improvement, especially when proper supports are in place to help them succeed. Most parent students are women (71%), and many are single parents. These students tend to be lower-income, first generation, and from communities of color. They are more likely to attend community colleges and public institutions to earn their credentials. Notably, parent students tend to have higher GPAs than non-parenting students, in addition to better time management and prioritization skills. Despite great promise, these students face unique challenges that can impact retention and completion rates. On average, it takes them longer to complete their degree and they are more likely to leave college before completing their degree or credential: Only 18% received a bachelor’s or associate degree within six years which is notably lower than their non-parenting peers. Parent students who must balance education with other responsibilities, including work and caregiving, are especially vulnerable to the factors that lead students to leave college before completing their degree or credential. With a tight labor market and declining unemployment, increased costs of college, and rising costs of child care, transportation, and housing, the share of parent students has declined in recent years. Reversing this trend and improving retention and completion for parent students requires policymakers to create pathways to high value credential and degree programs alongside robust support systems to unlock the potential of parent students. How Can Institutions Better Support Parent Students? Whether individuals are seeking a two- or four-year degree or alternative credential/certificate, increased educational pursuits are critical to preparing productive workers and engaged citizens.  Research shows that the return on investment in parent student programming is high, with positive benefits for taxpayers and the economy more broadly. As parent students become an increasingly integral part of the postsecondary landscape, policymakers and institutional leaders should explore innovative solutions. Recognizing the need to better prioritize parent students, several states across the political spectrum have implemented initiatives to enhance their postsecondary experience, demonstrating that these improvements can gain bipartisan interest. The solution is not one-size-fits-all; states and institutions need to be responsive to the unique needs of their parent student population. This can include bolstering the on-campus supports that institutions offer, including child care centers, family-friendly study lounges, priority registration access,&hellip;",

    "content": "With the 2025 tax filing season officially underway—and a busy legislative year ahead, from tax reform to the debt limit—it’s as good a time as any to revisit why fiscal policy matters and the role we each play as taxpayers. The federal government collects revenue from a variety of sources—individual income taxes, payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare, excise taxes, corporate income taxes, and fees—to fund programs and services that millions of Americans rely on. Taxpayers have an opportunity now to familiarize themselves with the tax system and how it aligns with their community’s priorities. Paying Taxes: Complex But Crucial Americans have a complicated relationship with the tax system, but improving public awareness is key to building a more civically engaged and informed society. According to a 2024 Pew Research poll, over half of taxpayers (56%) felt that the amount they paid in taxes was more than their fair share. Eighty-five percent of respondents reported frustration with the complexity of the federal tax system. Not only do Americans think taxes are unfair and confusing, they also have strong opinions on the return on their tax dollars. A University of Chicago and Associated Press study indicated that 67% of adults consider their federal income tax liability to be too high. About 1 in 4 say they are indifferent to the value they get in return for paying taxes, with nearly a quarter believing they receive valuable services and one-third saying they receive poor services. Part of this could be explained by the fact that many Americans do not know where their federal tax dollars go. In the same University of Chicago and Associated Press poll, 66% of respondents reported a lack of confidence in the way taxes are spent by the federal government. More information and awareness, however, can improve understanding of where taxes go. Check the Receipt: Where Did Your Money Go? The Bipartisan Policy Center, Intuit, and Polco launched the Federal Taxpayer Receipt in 2024 to help Americans better understand where their federal taxes go. The interactive tool provides the public with an itemized estimate of how their federal tax dollars are allocated across government programs and services based on their annual federal tax bill. Seeing how the federal government distributes funds—from national defense and infrastructure to housing assistance and healthcare—allows users to make informed judgements about whether their taxes are being used effectively. The taxpayer receipt separates tax revenue contributions across 11 primary government spending categories, with more detailed breakdowns for key agencies and programs. Data in the tool is routinely updated to reflect the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and other government agencies. Power of the Purse: Can You Break Washington’s Budget Gridlock? &nbsp; How do you think lawmakers are doing when it comes to efficiently and effectively allocating taxpayer dollars?

    "content": "This blog post is part of a joint series by the Bipartisan Policy Center and Terra Praxis. Terra Praxis is a nonprofit organization focused on innovating and accelerating scalable solutions to decarbonize the largest sources of global emissions. Check out the first blog post in the series, Momentum Grows to Repower Retiring Coal Plants with Nuclear. Repowering closing coal plants with advanced nuclear represents both an opportunity and a challenge. In the previous blog post of this series, Momentum Grows to Repower Retiring Coal Plants with Nuclear, we detailed the tangible economic and energy reliability benefits of coal-to-nuclear projects. Delivered effectively, they can ensure the preservation of jobs, revitalize communities, and provide clean power available 24/7 to the grid. However, despite these potential advantages, the shift to nuclear energy is not a guaranteed success. To the contrary, numerous hurdles need to be overcome if coal-to-nuclear projects are to become a reality. Significant changes to the current nuclear deployment model are required to make this transformation both technically feasible and effective in terms of cost and schedule. Current Challenges in Nuclear Deployment While a nuclear reactor could theoretically replace coal to create steam for many power plants, today’s nuclear energy deployment model cannot meet the speed or scale required to repower hundreds of coal plants or maintain American nuclear leadership, a goal set forth in the bipartisan Advance Act of 2024. Coal-to-nuclear projects must be constructed quickly enough to prevent the loss of transmission rights and retain the existing power plant workforce, all while maintaining commercial viability. To repower the coal plants currently operating in the United States by 2040, more than one coal-to-nuclear project would need to be completed every month, starting now. Given current U.S. nuclear deployment timelines of 6-10 years per project, achieving this goal requires a total paradigm shift in nuclear construction. Unfortunately, both traditional nuclear reactors and many advanced designs face challenges with complexity, high costs, and slow construction, making it difficult to fully capitalize on this opportunity. Studies such as the Energy Technologies Institute Nuclear Cost Driver project have identified challenges at the heart of this issue. They include site-specific engineering requirements that make each nuclear plant a bespoke project, increasing complexity and regulatory burdens. Additionally, large-scale traditional designs rely on inefficient construction techniques requiring large, on-site crews, which delay timelines and tie up resources. Limited standardization across projects reduces supply chain efficiency, further driving up costs. Regulatory hurdles also impose time-consuming and expensive approval processes, adding delays and uncertainty. To successfully transition retiring coal plants to nuclear, the nuclear industry must reimagine how reactors are designed, licensed, constructed, and delivered. Learning from Past Nuclear Projects and Other Industries Research of past nuclear projects reveals, among other lessons, two critical delivery principles for reducing the cost and schedule of nuclear projects: Fleet deployment and integrated project delivery. Fleet deployment involves systematically building multiple power plants across sites and multiple units at each plant to leverage economies of scale and transfer project learnings.

    "content": "We’ve all heard the phrase, “a change of scenery would do you good.” Can the same be said for increasing bipartisanship in Congress? Interpersonal relationships are crucial to the legislative process, and travel with colleagues is an impactful tool for members of Congress and their staff to build relationships that facilitate better lawmaking. After all, it’s harder to disparage—and much easier to trust—a colleague when you’ve shared experiences and broken bread together. This is a core tenet of BPC’s American Congressional Exchange (ACE), through which members of Congress visit a colleague from the opposite party in their home district. Recent empirical evidence shows the positive, measurable impacts of lawmakers traveling together. Drawing on a unique dataset of member congressional delegation (CODEL) travel abroad from 1994 through 2020, political scientists James Curry and Jason Roberts examine how interpersonal relationships impact legislative collaboration. Enhanced by interviews with senior congressional staff, the authors find that relationship-building through travel can bolster bipartisan collaboration among members of Congress. Curry and Roberts find that members from across the ideological spectrum participate in CODELs, which parallels the ideological diversity of policymakers who have participated in ACE. Note: This figure displays ACE participant ideology as measured by DW-NOMINATE scores. For more information on score methodology, visit https://voteview.com/about. The researchers also found a statistically significant relationship between CODEL travel and the rate at which a member would introduce bipartisan legislation, even when controlling for other factors. Similarly, political scientists Zachary McGee and Philip Moniz find that travel is associated with greater effectiveness in advancing legislation and provides members with valuable information about the impacts of specific policies. Their study also reveals that the size of the trip is an important aspect in generating the benefits of trip-taking—the smaller the better, they argue. Here, too, ACE mirrors these best practices, with trips typically including just two lawmakers to provide more face-to-face time for members to create lasting bonds with their colleague from across the aisle. There is also evidence that willingness to travel is an indicator of a member’s desire to build relationships with their colleagues, and that travel is a useful tool for building interpersonal relationships. But making these connections across the aisle is often the most difficult step, as the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress noted during numerous hearings on strengthening Congress. Programs like the American Congressional Exchange fill the gap, creating opportunities for members of Congress to build relationships outside the crucible of Washington and identify trusted collaborators for bipartisan lawmaking. Over the past seven years, ACE has conducted 54 trips with 64 individual members of Congress and senior staff. Participants have invariably remarked that spending time with colleagues in their districts has deepened their policy understanding and built bonds of trust. Upon returning to Washington, ACE participants have leveraged the relationships built during these exchanges to team up on dozens of pieces of bipartisan legislation, including three bills signed into law as of 2024. Even when legislative collaboration isn’t immediate, members tout the&hellip;",

    "content": "In the aftermath of a global pandemic, an evolving labor market, and unprecedented fiscal constraints, it is clear that the United States faces an urgent challenge with human capital—the collective skills, knowledge, and experience of the American people. We have too many  families who struggle to find and afford quality child care, young students who are unable to read and do math at grade level, and graduates who are unprepared to enter the workforce. At the same time, there is a mismatch between the skills attained and jobs available. Industries are searching for qualified workers, while technological advances and automation present both opportunities and threats to the future workforce. Although boundless in its potential, our nation’s human capital faces worrying trends. The challenges are complex and sprawling, requiring policymakers to act intentionally to harness the potential of the American people, businesses, and economy. The actions we take today will have far reaching impacts that will be critical to developing a resilient and skilled workforce. BPC’s Human Capital Program recently launched a Commission on the American Workforce, tasked with developing a bipartisan blueprint to address these challenges. The Commission brings together academics, business leaders, government officials, and policy experts from across the political spectrum to deliberate on critical issues from early childhood education to workforce development. BPC’s recommendations will focus on ensuring every American has access to economic opportunity, building a workforce for the future, and nurturing the talent necessary to remain a global leader. Growing Pains The United States is at a crossroads. Our population is growing slowly and aging quickly. Too many employers cannot find qualified workers to fill open positions, and our workforce isn’t equipped to meet the demands of the modern economy. Without action these challenges will only persist, threatening the stability of communities and the broader economy. So how did we get here? And where do we go now? Building the Future of the American Workforce Reversing these trends starts with needed improvements to the K-12 education system to better build the foundation for lifelong learning. Recent data from the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) shows that math and reading scores for 4th and 8th graders continue to decline, partially due to disruptions from the pandemic followed by slow and uneven academic recovery. However, students are performing below even pre-pandemic levels, largely erasing the gains the country had seen in the early 2000s. Moreover, gaps between the lowest- and highest-performing students have widened. Addressing these challenges is critical to creating a skilled workforce for the future and will also put young people on the path to future success. Changes to the K-12 system must go hand-in-hand with changes to the postsecondary system. By the end of the decade nearly 80% of jobs in the United States will require some postsecondary education. While a persistent push to increase postsecondary attainment has led to overall gains for many Americans, the misalignment in skills earned and jobs available calls into question the viability of the current system.

    "content": "Debt held by the public is nearing 100% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and is expected to blow past historic records—reaching 118% of GDP by fiscal year 2035 under current law. Projections from the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) latest Budget and Economic Outlook underscore the urgent challenge for the 119th Congress to begin to address the unsustainable level of deficit financing. Rising debt will increasingly create a drag on economic growth, fuel inflation, and elevate interest rates for families and businesses. Over the next ten years, federal spending will average approximately 24% of GDP, while federal revenues to pay for that spending are projected to average only about 18% of GDP. These figures assume many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) expire at the end of 2025 as scheduled in current law. If those tax cuts are extended without offsetting provisions, the annual deficit will further widen. In 2025, total mandatory and net interest spending is projected to approximately equal total revenues collected, implying every dollar of discretionary spending appropriated by Congress is borrowed. Policymakers and experts use CBO’s annual baseline projections to inform ideas to improve the nation’s fiscal outlook. They also serve as an important yardstick against which potential budgetary changes are measured. This blog highlights key federal budget and economy takeaways and data from CBO’s report at the start of an especially consequential year for fiscal policy. The Budget Outlook The deficit is projected to hit $1.9 trillion in FY2025 (6.2% of GDP), not far from FY2024’s deficit of $1.8 trillion (6.4% of GDP). Over the next decade (FY2026-2035), the annual deficit will rise to $2.5 trillion but remain relatively flat compared to the size of the economy (approximately 6% of GDP). In comparison to June 2024’s CBO outlook, deficits are now projected to be a cumulative $1 trillion less over FY2025-2034. The main contributor to this is a $2.5 trillion decrease in cumulative deficits from economic changes, namely stronger projected tax collections due to higher economic growth. Partially offsetting the economic boost to the baseline is a $1.3 trillion increase in cumulative deficits from technical adjustments to CBO’s baseline and a $271 billion increase in cumulative deficits due to legislative changes, including additional outlays stemming from enactment of the Social Security Fairness Act in early 2025. Growth in the National Debt and Interest Costs Debt held by the public (the portion of the country&#8217;s total debt that is owed to individuals, businesses, and foreign governments) will be $30.1 trillion (100% of GDP) by the end of the current fiscal year. Debt is expected to increase by $22 trillion to $52.1 trillion (118% of GDP) by FY2035—higher than any point in our nation’s history. Before the end of this decade, debt as a share of the economy is projected to surpass levels last seen during World War II. Net Interest, Social Security, and Health Programs Dominate Spending Growth As the national debt grows, so will interest payments to bondholders. Net interest spending will&hellip;",

    "content": "Last month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released its most recent Point-in-Time (PIT) count, confirming what many housing advocates feared: homelessness in the United States reached an all-time high last year. The count, taken during the last 10 days of January 2024, found that 771,480 people were experiencing homelessness—an 18% increase over the previous year and the largest one-year jump in the history of the count. These record-breaking numbers reflect several factors, including rising housing costs, the expiration of pandemic-era rental assistance, and increased migration placing pressure on shelter systems. As policymakers digest the data, several key trends stand out. Homelessness is a national problem Continuing the trend from 2023, homelessness increased in 43 states and Washington, DC, across urban, suburban, and rural areas. The count found increases in homelessness across nearly all demographics, including individuals and families, those in shelters, and those in unsheltered settings. Chronic homelessness has also reached record levels: 152,585 people—one in three homeless individuals—now meet HUD’s definition of chronic homelessness. Note: The graph does not display some data points from 2021 because of pandemic-related disruptions to counts. Source: 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, HUD Representatives from Continuums of Care (CoCs) cited several contributing factors: Increased shelter capacity (which can inflate sheltered counts) The expiration of eviction moratoria and pandemic rental assistance A shortage of affordable housing Natural disasters, such as the Maui wildfires Increased migration straining shelter systems For example, CoCs in New York attributed the rise in homelessness to increased evictions as cities worked through backlogs that built up during the eviction moratorium, as well as higher rents and the loss of pandemic-era assistance. Meanwhile, Hawaii saw an 87% spike in homelessness, largely due to the Maui wildfires. While the PIT count provides the best available national estimate, it has well-known methodological limitations and—as a one-night snapshot—understates the true scale of homelessness over a year. Many more people experience homelessness annually than this count captures. The homelessness response system has scaled up, but inflow has also increased HUD’s report highlights a significant increase in the nation’s homelessness response capacity. Between 2023 and 2024, the total number of beds available for people experiencing homelessness grew by 13%, with an overall increase of 29% since 2020. Permanent housing programs like Rapid Rehousing (RRH) and Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) have also expanded; PSH capacity has more than doubled since 2007. However, this growth has not kept pace with rising homelessness. One CoC leader summed up the challenge to HUD, stating that there are more people experiencing homelessness than beds available. The supportive services workforce is also struggling, with chronic staffing shortages making it harder to meet growing needs. Migration is placing new strains on shelters While the PIT count doesn’t track immigration status, several CoCs cited migration as a driver of increases in sheltered homelessness. Among 13 CoCs that cited migration pressures, homelessness spiked by 64%, with sharp increases in family homelessness.

    "content": "President John F. Kennedy once remarked, “Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.” Congress—prone to gridlock, operating with arcane procedures, and relying heavily on outdated analog and paper-based systems—is not typically thought of as a dynamic or forward-looking institution. Thus, it may be easy to overlook that for the past six years, Congress has been engaged in an effort to update its internal operations to build a more effective, efficient, and transparent institution. Operating behind the scenes on a bipartisan basis, congressional modernizers have helped ensure Congress does not “miss the future” and inhibit its ability to remain a responsive and representative institution. The Bipartisan Policy Center closely follows the work of the House Subcommittee on Modernization &amp; Innovation and its progress made in the implementation of modernization recommendations; the expansion of the modernization approach to other arenas of congressional business; and areas where the subcommittee has taken the helm on raising new issues for consideration. BPC analysis of the subcommittee’s latest comprehensive report on the status of modernization recommendations found that at the close of the 118th Congress, 102 recommendations are closed/implemented, 48 are in progress, and 52 remain unaddressed. Notable achievements from the past two years include: Technology: The creation of Deconflict and HouseCal tools to reduce committee scheduling conflicts (Rec # 59); improvements to the Capitol Switchboard to enable better data sharing between chambers (Rec #190); and institutionalization of the Congressional Hackathon (Rec #181). Professional Development: The institutionalization of a member leadership academy in the Congressional Excellence Program within the Chief Administrative Officer (Rec #15); the expansion of the staff Student Loan Repayment Program to include tuition assistance and professional development certification reimbursement (Rec #106); and the creation of a House Intern Resource Office (Rec #110). Constituent Services: The construction of ADA-compliant drop-off and pick-up zones within the Capitol complex (Rec #114); updated congressional websites to be more accessible and Section 508 compliant (Rec #27 and #117); and updated policies to allow member offices to partner with non-governmental organizations to co-sponsor constituent service events (Rec #154). The subcommittee has also charted a new course beyond the 200 original recommendations by the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. For example, the Modernization Subcommittee led the charge in investigating how artificial intelligence technologies could impact chamber operations. Throughout the 118th Congress, the subcommittee issued eight reports on general strategy and implementation guidelines for the House’s approach to AI. This forward-looking approach led some observers to name Congress one of the world’s leading legislatures in confronting this emerging technology. The dawn of the 119th Congress will bring change to the congressional modernization landscape. Former Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-WA), a longtime champion of modernization, has retired from Congress, creating an opportunity for new Democratic leadership to bring fresh ideas. This already happened on the Republican side of the aisle during the 118th Congress, when Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-OK) became chair of the modernization subcommittee.&hellip;",

While the long-term impacts of these policies remain to be seen, it is valuable to assess the current landscape. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) recently released a report highlighting updated timelines for completing Environmental Impact Statements (EISs), a key step in project permitting required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). While the data indicate progress in reducing EIS review timelines, they also underscore a persistent challenge: The majority of EISs still exceed the statutory two-year deadline. New CEQ Data Shows Improvements and Challenges CEQ’s findings reveal that just 39% of EISs completed since the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023 meet the law’s required two-year deadline. While this marks an improvement from pre-FRA figures—when just 29% of EISs were completed within two years—61% still exceed the legally required timeframe. Additionally, CEQ data reveals that nearly a quarter of projects that completed an EIS since the FRA&#8217;s enactment took more than five years, with some extending beyond a decade. Amendments made to NEPA in the FRA aim to streamline permitting by requiring agencies to complete EISs within two years unless a specific extension is provided. However, as the FRA was enacted less than two years ago, its full impact on new projects remains unclear. CEQ notes that current data mostly reflects EISs initiated before the FRA. Moreover, the data that would be more useful is not a backwards look at what was completed last year, but a look at how many EISs that began in a given year have been completed or are still ongoing. Monitoring EIS timelines in the coming years will be essential to assess the legislation&#8217;s effectiveness. The Importance of Streamlining EIS Processes An EIS is used to evaluate the environmental consequences of major federal actions, ensuring that infrastructure and energy projects comply with regulatory requirements and minimize environmental harm. The document analyzes the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project, reviewing both the positive and negative effects and proposing alternative actions that could be taken to minimize the negative effects. However, delays in the EIS process have long been a bottleneck, hindering the timely development of critical infrastructure needed to modernize the nation’s energy systems, reduce emissions, and strengthen supply chain resilience. As the United States strives to meet its ambitious economic, national security, and energy and climate goals, making the EIS process more efficient is vital. Protracted reviews can stall investments, increase costs, and slow the deployment of transformative projects that bring new energy resources to the grid. Delays risk undermining bipartisan priorities, including energy affordability, reliability, and reduced emissions. Understanding the Drivers of Delays The CEQ’s report identifies several factors contributing to prolonged EIS timelines, many of which reflect inefficiencies in the permitting process: Lack of Coordination: Large-scale projects often involve multiple jurisdictions, agencies, and stakeholders, requiring extensive coordination that&hellip;",

    "content": "On January 2, the debt limit was reinstated at $36.1 trillion to accommodate borrowing since its suspension through the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. After a brief decrease in debt mainly due to the redemption of special securities in the Medicare trust funds, the U.S. will reach its debt limit on January 21. Until Congress acts to modify the limit, the Treasury Department must rely on approximately $700 billion of cash on hand and about $350 billion of available extraordinary measures to continue paying our bills in full and on time. Monitoring the X Date BPC is closely monitoring daily cash flows to project when Treasury will find itself at high risk of exhausting existing cash on hand and extraordinary measures and defaulting on its obligations—what BPC has coined the X Date. How quickly we reach the X Date depends heavily on several factors, including: Total 2024 tax refunds during the first quarter of the calendar year, when most taxpayers file their taxes. The strength of individual and corporate tax collections during tax season. The volume and speed of disaster recovery outlays in regions impacted by recent hurricanes, wildfires, and other emergencies. Cash on hand and extraordinary measures will enable the federal government to continue fulfilling its obligations through tax season, at which point an influx of revenue will help Treasury buoy its finances for an additional, uncertain period. As always, there is significant economic and policy uncertainty this far out. During the prior debt limit episode in 2023, for example, tax collections were $250 billion short of Congressional Budget Office expectations, and tax filing relief granted by the IRS to people impacted by disasters in California (among other localities) resulted in $42 billion in delayed tax collections. These combined factors accelerated the initial time frame—potentially by several months—and heightened uncertainty over the X Date. The Costs to Taxpayers Prior debt limit episodes have demonstrated the costs and risks to taxpayers from delayed action on the debt limit, underscoring the benefit of lawmakers acting far in advance of the X Date. Interest rates on short-term U.S. securities increased during debt limit episodes in 2011 and 2013, adding to total net interest costs funded by taxpayer dollars. Credit rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch downgraded U.S. government debt following episodes in 2011 and 2023, respectively. Moody’s also downgraded its outlook on the United States’ credit rating in 2023. Sovereign credit downgrades are especially concerning because they can cause some investment funds to stop investing in U.S. securities, leading to higher borrowing costs. This eventually makes it more expensive for Americans to borrow funds to purchase homes, cars, and more. Failing to address the debt limit in a timely manner can undermine investor confidence that the federal government will make good on all its obligations, and lenders may demand higher interest rates—which results in higher costs for taxpayers. During the culmination of the 2023 debt limit episode, Treasury sold $50 billion of four-week securities scheduled to mature on June 6 at&hellip;",

    "content": "Recent unorthodox behavior from some congressional staff has caricatured them as activist, self-involved, and unindustrious. Yet in reality, the vast majority of congressional staff are hardworking, ambitious, patriotic individuals willing to make sacrifices in service of improving our country and helping their fellow citizens. This is how congressional staff have carried out their duties for over a century. The Congressional Progressive Staff Association recently sent a letter to House and Senate leadership recommending that—in response to the long work hours many staff on Capitol Hill keep—they ought to be allowed to work shorter, 32-hour weeks when official business is less demanding. The letter follows a recent trend of unconventional behavior from congressional staff. For example, from late 2023 to mid-2024, a minority of staff broke from the traditional confines of their official positions to make demands of members of Congress concerning the Israel-Palestine conflict—often in contention with their own employer’s positions. An aphorism has long governed staff behavior on Capitol Hill: they should be rarely seen and never heard. They work diligently, but behind the scenes. This is for good reason. Congressional staff are not elected, and their positions are political appointments. Staff should not confuse their own role for the responsibility bestowed upon their bosses; they work for the people elected to represent Americans. Staff should use the unique channels available to them to influence their bosses, giving discreet advice and analysis—not public coercion. Congressional staff often do work long hours—sometimes 60 hours per week or more—and with enthusiasm. The more senior the role, the more likely the expectation that staff are “always on the clock.” In some congressional offices, even junior staff are expected to keep long hours despite pay that registers below a living wage and leaves many living paycheck to paycheck in the expensive Washington, DC, metro area. Congressional staff are not afforded the steady work hours of federal civil servants, and their offices have precious few resources compared with the healthy budgets allocated to the executive branch for political appointees. They have the worst of both worlds: long hours, low pay. These conditions are just one cause of Congress’s overall decline in capacity to carry out its constitutional role and solve problems for the American people. Congress recognized this when it quietly began a process of modernization and performance improvement in 2019 with the bipartisan Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. With regard to staff, the committee found what many scholars had previously observed: the volume and tenure of congressional staff levels has declined despite the vast growth of Congress’s workload in recent decades. Worse, staff recruitment, retention, and training tools were insufficient, with a loss in expertise and institutional knowledge as a result. Thanks to the select committee and the successive Subcommittee on Modernization, the House has begun to turn things around with new training opportunities, including the implementation of a pay floor and raising of outdated pay caps, among other improvements. In all, the select committee generated more than 200 recommendations to&hellip;",

Kennedy Jr.&#8217;s focus on &#8216;Making America Healthy Again&#8217; brings attention to at least one issue we should all agree on: addressing the decline in Americans&#8217; life expectancy. A new study in Lancet indicates that the United States ranks 49th in the world in life expectancy and is forecasted to fall to 66th by 2050. The next administration and Congress should resolve to set a bipartisan and national goal to reverse this increasing gap and raise life expectancy for all Americans. The reasons for the U.S. lag in life expectancy are well-documented and predate the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2014 and 2016, the country experienced its first three-year decline in life expectancy since the 1918 Spanish flu. Key factors included a plateauing in the decline of cardiovascular deaths, a rise in diseases of despair such as drug overdoses, suicide, and alcohol abuse, and the obesity crisis. Preventable deaths from COVID-19 plunged us further back compared to peer countries and our rebound has been slower than that of these countries. In setting a national goal to raise U.S. life expectancy, one might argue for greater attention to issues such as accelerating adult smoking cessation, decreasing gun violence, reducing the uninsured, or increasing investments in housing or education. All of these are critical, but a key question is whether there are issues that we can’t afford not to focus on given their impact on life expectancy. Here are three issues to consider: Obesity Obesity and poor diet shorten lives both directly and indirectly, particularly by stalling progress in reducing chronic disease deaths. Solutions require a mix of policies which include reshaping our obesogenic environment (healthy food financing initiatives, modifications to agricultural subsidies, and reduction of hyperpalatable ingredients in the food supply such as added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats), consumer education (dietary guidelines and front-of-package labeling), and health care interventions (behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy). Given that better nutrition, as opposed to hunger, is now the nation’s most urgent food policy concern, we need a new bipartisan coalition which can make addressing this a priority. While past administrations have addressed obesity, it has been more of a secondary issue; it’s now urgent to tackle it as the top issue. Primary Care Over the last 50 years, the percentage of primary care physicians has steadily dropped from roughly 50% of all physicians to now less than 25%. This decline matters because a robust primary care system is linked to better health outcomes, lower costs, and higher life expectancy. Unfortunately, studies show that neither is the primary care workforce growing fast enough to meet our population’s needs nor is the U.S. investment in primary care commensurate with its value. If policymakers addressed these issues, greater team-based care led by primary care physicians could lead to higher uptake of clinical preventive services such as cancer screenings, better blood pressure control, increased treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder, and integrated care for individuals with co-occurring physical and mental health diagnoses. All these actions would&hellip;",

    "content": "The federal government allocates about $2 billion annually to colleges and universities through two financial aid programs—Federal Work-Study (FWS) and the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG). These programs are an important source of financial aid for many low-income students. But the allocation formulas, which are heavily influenced by historical funding levels and cost of attendance, are outdated and regressive. As a result, campus-based aid allocations provide a disproportionate share of resources to wealthier and higher-cost institutions and do not effectively direct dollars to institutions serving the largest share of low-income students. This issue brief highlights the allocation disparities in campus-based aid and the potential effects of alternative allocation strategies. It explains how the funding formulas work, shows how much aid they allocate to public fouryear and two-year institutions, as well as to private nonprofit and for-profit institutions. The brief also estimates the impact of alternative strategies on campus-based aid funding to the different postsecondary sectors. Notably, the most selective 58 private nonprofits received almost 9% of FWS funds while accounting for only about 1% of “Pell completions”—the number of Pell recipients who complete a degree or certificate. Conversely, community colleges received about 18% of FWS dollars and 25% of SEOG and were responsible for 39% of Pell completions. Basing allocations on Pell enrollment or completion would approximately double the share of FWS dollars going to community colleges.",

    "content": "According to a recent report from the Federal Reserve, 37% of adults said they would not have covered a hypothetical $400 expense in the last year using cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next payment, likely pointing to difficulties covering such an expense. Separately, 10% of non-retired adults reported tapping their retirement savings to cover an emergency expense in the prior 12 months. Notwithstanding significant fluctuations in financial insecurity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, data on the inability of adults to cover emergency expenses remains consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Individuals with no or inadequate emergency savings are 13 times more likely to take a hardship withdrawal from long-term savings accounts than those with adequate emergency savings. To that end, having at least $1,000 in emergency savings cuts in half the likelihood of workers withdrawing from their retirement account during economic crisis, but data suggests that low- to moderate-income (LMI) households struggle to accumulate such savings. Low- and Moderate-Income Households Are Least Likely to Have Emergency Savings It is not surprising that LMI households save less than higher-income households. Data from BlackRock reveals that a disproportionate number of LMI households have no emergency savings at all, putting them at a higher risk of adverse effects from economic shocks. Specifically, 43% of households with annual income less than $60,000 did not have any emergency savings, whereas only 12% of households with income greater than $200,000 had no emergency savings. Table 1: Presence of Emergency Savings Increases as Household Income Rises Household Income Under $60k $60k to $100k $100k to $200k Above $200k Percentage of households without any emergency savings 2024 43% 28% 17% 12% Source: BlackRock The difference in income is an obvious factor, but LMI households are also more likely to be engaged in part-time, freelance, or temporary jobs, which often lack job security and benefits and are associated with financial insecurity. Part-time workers, in particular, frequently find themselves among the “working poor.” Additionally, LMI households experience higher rates of unemployment compared to higher-income groups, undercutting their financial wellbeing. Emergency Savings Can Improve Long-Term Financial Stability for LMI Households Building on existing research, recent evidence reinforces the thesis that emergency savings can help LMI households bolster financial stability. One in five Americans say they have taken a loan against their retirement savings, and these loans are largely for unexpected or emergency household expenses that could be covered with adequate emergency savings. LMI households are the most likely to tap into their retirement savings during financial emergencies, while also significantly less likely to save for retirement in the first place, holding other factors constant. Accumulating short-term emergency funds allows LMI households to handle unexpected expenses without touching their retirement savings, preserving long-term investments and preventing the associated penalties and tax implications that can arise from early withdrawals. Having a well-funded emergency savings account can reduce the likelihood of taking hardship withdrawals or loans from retirement accounts, helping individuals maintain the principal in their retirement accounts and continue benefitting from&hellip;",

    "content": "As a company seeks to meet its climate goals, carbon credits that are bought and sold in a voluntary carbon market (VCM) are one tool it can reach for (more on the VCM here). But what could be a simple financial transaction raises a host of questions for the purchaser: How do corporate leaders know what they are buying if they cannot directly track the emissions that have been reduced, avoided, or removed by a particular project? How do they know that any specific carbon credit is effective at addressing climate change? How are companies allowed to use carbon credits? What happens if the credit turns out to be fraudulent? While companies puzzle over these questions, many are holding off on buying carbon credits, which reduces funding for vital climate projects. Recently, the U.S. government, as well as various other non-governmental, state-level, and global entities, has taken steps to address ongoing concerns in the VCM. This blog summarizes those recent actions to clarify the rules of engagement for buyers, sellers, and brokers of carbon credits. The actions taken could increase confidence in the VCM and facilitate greater capital flows to high-quality carbon reduction, avoidance, and removal projects. The State of Play with Carbon Credits in the VCM Carbon credits are tradable instruments that represent a defined quantity (usually one metric ton or its equivalent) of carbon dioxide that is either prevented from reaching, or is directly removed from, the atmosphere as the result of a specified, verifiable action or project. The purchase of these credits in the VCM has the potential to drive billions of dollars toward vital climate projects, such as direct air capture, natural carbon sinks, or renewable energy projects. However, this impact depends on companies actively purchasing high-quality credits. When companies purchase high-quality credits on the VCM, they are providing the necessary funding for projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere or avoid its release. Concerns about credit quality have long plagued the VCM. In 2023, analysts valued the VCM at $723 million. While that is higher than its value in 2020 and the preceding 12 years, 2023 marked the second consecutive year that the global volume and value of the VCM contracted. According to Ecosystem Marketplace’s State of the Voluntary Carbon Market report for 2024, one explanation for this contraction is that buyers were waiting to purchase credits pending the release of guidance from various integrity initiatives. Greater transparency of and confidence in the VCM is needed to further develop this market and allow it to meet its full potential as a vehicle for climate finance. Actions Being Taken to Address Concerns Encouragingly, government agencies at federal, state, and global levels are taking steps to alleviate concerns from VCM participants and to improve the integrity and overall functionality of carbon credits and the market.

The AHCAH initiative, established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, allows CMS-approved hospitals to provide acute inpatient care to eligible Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service patients at home. However, the program will end in 2024 unless Congress acts. The event opened with remarks from BPC Senior Vice President Bill Hoagland, Advocate Health Executive Vice President and Chief Physician Executive Dr. Scott Rissmiller, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Senior Policy Advisor Kathy Hempstead. BPC Senior Advisor and former CMS Chief Medical Officer Dr. Lee Fleisher, alongside Advocate Health Innovation Strategic Advisor Colleen Hole, shared additional insights on the program. Attendees learned about the history, key features, early outcomes, and recommended federal policy reforms for the AHCAH initiative, as detailed in BPC’s brief, The Future of Acute Hospital Care at Home. Advocate Health also provided a live hospital at home demonstration, giving attendees a firsthand experience of the model as patients. Dr. Lee Fleisher shares insights on implementing CMS&#8217; AHCAH initiative. Attendees discuss evidence for acute hospital care at home following the speaker series. Audience learns about launching an acute hospital care at home program from Dr. Scott Rissmiller. Key Takeaways from the Event 1) A five-year reauthorization of the AHCAH initiative would encourage broader hospital participation, including in rural areas, and allow for the collection of critical data to inform future policy and programmatic decisions. BPC recommends policymakers reauthorize the program for five years and continue to evaluate it, ensuring the initiative maintains program integrity, safeguards patient and caregiver safety, and supports future, evidence-based policy and implementation. “Hospital at home programs can improve patient satisfaction, achieve health outcomes comparable to traditional care, and potentially offer cost savings. This underscores the importance of further studying the program.” —Bill Hoagland, Senior Vice President, BPC 2) CMS’ AHCAH hospital at home initiative shows promise, but more research is needed on costs, services, outcomes, and patient and caregiver experiences. Participation in the program remains limited due to challenges such as statutory uncertainty, which prevents some state Medicaid departments and hospitals from fully investing in the initiative. “We need to design a good evaluation that properly asks, how much does this cost…We need research on staffing metrics, how patients and caregivers interact with the program, barriers for individuals from diverse populations, and opportunities and risks for modifying the program.” —Dr. Lee Fleisher, Senior Advisor, BPC 3) Hospitals implementing the hospital at home initiative are developing promising practices that strengthen the program and should guide federal technical assistance. Advocate Health emphasized that providing care at home allows a greater understanding of patients’ needs beyond medical treatment and helps providers to connect patients to community partners to address those challenges. BPC recommends that Congress direct CMS to provide enhanced technical assistance to help hospitals and states overcome implementation barriers and improve program access, particularly for Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries.&hellip;",

Terra Praxis is a nonprofit organization focused on innovating and accelerating scalable solutions to decarbonize the largest sources of global emissions. Check out the second blog post in the series, How to Streamline Nuclear Power Plant Construction. Growing energy demand, advances in reactor technology, and recent legislative and regulatory progress are fueling rising interest in nuclear energy. This momentum could open the door to repowering retiring coal plants with nuclear—an approach that could boost local economies while providing the grid with clean reliable energy, as outlined in BPC’s 2023 report, Can Advanced Nuclear Repower Coal Country? This summer, Congress overwhelmingly passed and President Joe Biden signed into law the bipartisan ADVANCE Act, which aims to speed up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#8217;s (NRC) licensing process, reclaim U.S. leadership in nuclear energy, and clarify the regulatory framework for coal-to-nuclear conversions. In response to concerns over lengthy timelines, NRC proposed changes earlier this year to modernize the nuclear licensing process, including for small modular reactors (SMRs) with the potential for streamlined manufacturing and broader deployment. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) is also stepping up to back nuclear energy projects. In March, LPO announced a conditional $1.52 billion loan guarantee to repower Michigan’s Palisades nuclear plant, marking the first use of the Inflation Reduction Act’s $250 billion 1706 Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program. This program targets projects that upgrade and repower retired energy infrastructure with clean energy heat sources, including coal-to-nuclear conversions. Energy Needs for AI Have Also Sparked Private Sector Interest in Nuclear In September, Microsoft and Constellation announced a new 20-year power purchase agreement to revitalize and restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. The agreement will add approximately 835 megawatts (MW) of clean energy to the grid, in part to meet Microsoft’s growing energy demands. Most recently, to meet the company’s energy needs and climate goals, Google signed a 20-year agreement to purchase up to 500 MW of energy from SMRs to be constructed by Kairos Power over the coming decade. As improved regulatory and financial frameworks take shape, the focus now shifts to identifying retiring coal plant sites ripe for nuclear repowering and the potential economic benefits for those regions. Nearly a quarter of the U.S. coal-fired fleet is slated to retire by 2029, leaving behind valuable energy infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and communities dependent on the well-paying jobs and tax base these plants provide. It is crucial that policymakers, government agencies, and local stakeholders recognize and understand the potential of repowering specific plants set to retire, both to capitalize on this opportunity and to ensure a smooth transition for displaced workers. Clear communication and demonstration of this potential are key to fostering support and collaboration.

    "content": "American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities face distinct housing challenges, such as overcrowding, substandard housing on tribal lands, and more limited access to mortgage credit. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an estimated 68,000 new homes are needed to eliminate overcrowding and replace physically deficient housing. These issues are compounded by complex federal-tribal governance, insufficient funding, and varying needs across different tribal areas. Despite these hurdles, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act&#8217;s (NAHASDA) programs have made significant progress in addressing housing gaps, though challenges such as outdated funding levels and bureaucratic obstacles remain. Background The federal government’s role in providing housing assistance to AI/AN communities has evolved significantly over the past 60 years. With the passage of NAHASDA in 1996, HUD reorganized its tribal housing assistance programs and reoriented them to better support tribal sovereignty and self-determination. It eliminated nine of the 14 housing assistance programs serving AI/AN communities and replaced them with two new programs: the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program (also called the Native American Housing Block Grant Program) and the Title VI Loan Guarantee Program. The IHBG program provides grants to eligible Indian tribes (including Alaska Native villages) and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs), which are chosen by tribes to receive funds from HUD and use them to administer their housing programs. IHBG funds can be used for six types of activities, as well as for planning and administrative expenses. Additionally, funding can be allocated for training and technical assistance provided to national or regional organizations representing Native American housing interests. IHBG allocations follow a set formula, which considers factors such as the extent of poverty, the number of housing units developed under previous housing programs that continue to be operated by the tribe, and the population of federally recognized tribal members. In 2018, Congress introduced additional IHBG funding through the IHBG Competitive Grant Program, which awards grants based on “need and administrative capacity” and prioritizes projects that would generate new construction or rehabilitation. NAHASDA also created the Title VI Loan Guarantee Program to help AI/AN communities finance additional grant-eligible housing projects and related activities. The program enables Indian tribes and TDHEs to obtain private loans with a HUD guarantee, covering 95% of the outstanding principal and interest. These loans can fund affordable housing creation or rehabilitation, infrastructure or community facility construction, land acquisition for housing, architectural and engineering plans, and financing costs. Title VI loans are capped at roughly five times the need-based portion of the recipient’s IHBG allocation with no minimum loan size. Allocation of Funds and Impact Although Congress has continued to fund NAHASDA programs annually, it has not reauthorized NAHASDA since 2008. The annual appropriation for IHBG formula grants has decreased by 29% when adjusted for inflation, now making up less than 2% of HUD’s annual budget, even as HUD’s budget has grown by 58% in real terms. One estimate suggests that IHBG formula funding would need to exceed $1.6 billion&hellip;",

    "content": "The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be a nailbiter, with polling suggesting tight races across swing states. A handful of close House and Senate races will likely determine control of Congress for the next two years. Many election outcomes won’t be known on Election Day. It may take several days before the media can project winners in the presidential election, and it may be weeks before outlets can project winners in every congressional race. Here we address the following questions: Why don’t we know official results on election night? How do state laws and procedures impact how quickly ballots are counted? Why do close races take longer to call? Do longer waits impact the integrity of the outcome? Why don’t we know official results on election night? The result totals you see on election night are never final. Election officials start posting unofficial results once polls close on Election Day. In the days and weeks after the election, officials then “canvass,” or double check, results and make any needed corrections. Those results are then certified at the local and state level as the final official totals for that election. However, media outlets can usually project election outcomes with confidence well before certification. Media outlets and data aggregators call races based on unofficial results and other information like state-by-state survey data, turnout by voting type, and state rules and procedures. How do state laws and procedures impact how quickly ballots are counted? In close races, more ballots need to be counted for media outlets to project outcomes – and counting is almost never complete on election night. Some ballots take longer to process due to state laws and procedures that help ensure a secure and accurate election. Other harder-to-measure factors also impact tabulation speed, including staffing, how many pages the ballot is, and whether high-speed tabulators are in use. Some ballots that arrive on or after Election Day still need to be processed and counted. Mail ballots dropped off on Election Day. Some states, including Arizona, allow mail ballots to be dropped off at voting sites or election offices on Election Day. Those ballots still need to be verified, opened, flattened, and tabulated, all of which takes time. Ballots from military and overseas voters. Most states count ballots from military and overseas voters that arrive after Election Day. Mail ballots postmarked by Election Day. Many states will also count mail ballots received after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before Election Day. Those states include New York and California, home to 12 of the 43 closest U.S. House races this year. That means that outcomes of these races—and control of the House overall—may depend on legal and eligible ballots received after Election Day. Not every state permits ballot pre-processing. Many states permit election officials to begin processing mail ballots before Election Day, which enables election officials to report results more quickly. However, not every state permits ballot pre-processing, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania—both presidential swing states with close&hellip;",

    "content": "Voting is well underway in the 2024 general election, the first presidential election after the COVID-19 pandemic and since generative AI tools have become widely available. Observers have speculated about how today’s crowded information environment might shape public confidence in election outcomes. To better understand voter attitudes and information habits, BPC worked with Morning Consult to administer a national survey exploring: Confidence about the accuracy of the 2024 presidential election Where voters look for election information Voters’ concerns about AI What voters think about protecting online users from false election-related content We found that while voter confidence has increased over the last two years, voters are worried about AI, false information, post-election violence, and efforts to overturn election results. Voters also tend to think that social media companies could be doing a better job to protect users from harmful content. The survey was fielded from October 11–17 and builds on two similar surveys administered in October 2022 and December 2023. Responses and questions may be paraphrased here for readability. For the full survey instrument, see here. More methodological details in the appendix. Confidence about the accuracy of the 2024 presidential election 80% of voters are confident that votes in their county or city will be counted as intended this November, an increase since last year. Voters have higher confidence in electoral processes at the local and state level than at the national level, echoing findings from surveys BPC administered in 2022 and 2023. Voters’ confidence is higher today than in our prior surveys, an encouraging trend as we approach Election Day. Confidence has increased by approximately 7 percentage points from 2023 to 2024. How confident are you that ___ will be counted accurately in the 2024 presidential election? We asked voters the same questions in both December 2023 and October 2024. Partisan splits in confidence remain. Democratic and Independent voters remain more likely than Republicans to report that they are “somewhat” or “very” confident that votes will be counted accurately in the general election. This partisan divide was also present in 2022 and 2023 and in a recent Pew survey. How confident are you that ___ will be counted accurately in the 2024 general election? Where voters look for election information Voters look to election administrators for information on how to register and vote. Voters are most likely to look to local or county election administrators (27%) for information on how to register and vote, a finding consistent with our past surveys. This steady reliance on local administrators is reassuring, as they are the most accurate source of information about how to vote. Local administrators were followed closely by friends and family (24%) and federal election websites (23%). 47% of respondents said they would look to news media professionals for information on election results, a higher share than any other source across the three information types. This underscores the importance of the media as a bridge between election officials and voters, particularly when it comes to disseminating and contextualizing unofficial&hellip;",

    "content": "In recent months, an old idea has resurfaced in the immigration debate, driven in part by an increase in concerns over the United States maintaining its leadership in science and technology: foreign students graduating from U.S. institutions should have an easier time getting green cards.  A recent report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that Congress create new “pathways to permanent residency and citizenship for qualified foreign-born STEM talent,” and that “explicit eligibility for international STEM graduates of U.S. institutions should be included.” Why? Hundreds of thousands of talented foreign students study in U.S. universities every year, but because of post-graduation immigration obstacles, many leave, causing the country to lose out on their talents, and potentially demotivating others to enroll in the future. This idea has a history of bipartisan support. A 2020 BPC primer explains the challenges for international students transitioning to the American workforce: The Optional Practical Training (OPT) and Curricular Practical Training (CPT) programs for F-1 students, and academic training for J-1 students are time-limited. (STEM graduates can obtain longer durations.) To remain after F-1 or J-1 authorization ends, students normally ask an employer to sponsor them for an H-1B visa. These are allocated each year, generally by lottery since demand vastly exceeds supply. Foreign nationals sponsored by a higher educational organization, nonprofit research organization, or governmental research organization may be exempt from the lottery cap. To stay beyond the six years allowed on an H-1B visa, an employer must sponsor applicants for a green card. There are country-based employment green card backlogs, so it may be decades before they can get a green card. For example, a hypothetical Indian national might be forced to leave the United States after four years of undergraduate studies, two years of getting a master’s degree, three years of extended OPT for a STEM degree, and six years of employer-sponsored work visa – 15 years total: most of their adulthood spent in the United States. STEM Green Cards The idea of “STEM Green Cards” is not new and had past bipartisan support. The Progressive Policy Institute supported the idea as far back as 2010. And in 2012, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) proposed the STEM Jobs Act that would have replaced the diversity visa lottery program with a program to award green cards to master’s or Ph.D. graduates of U.S. universities in a STEM field. The Stopping Trained in America PhDs from Leaving the Economy (STAPLE) Act was another bipartisan attempt. First introduced in 2009 by then Rep. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), it gave permanent residency to students who obtained a Ph.D. in a STEM field from American universities and excluded them from the H-1B visa cap. It was reintroduced three more times, gaining bipartisan support but never made it out of committee. The Sustaining our Most Advanced Researchers and Technologies (SMART) Jobs Act, introduced by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Chris Coons (D-DE) in 2012, also had bipartisan support. The bill would establish an F-4 nonimmigrant visa for&hellip;",

    "content": "Affordable housing and high-quality child care help working parents maintain employment, support family economic mobility, and strengthen the economy. However, for many low-income families, soaring housing prices and child care costs are putting a strain on their budgets, forcing them to make difficult trade-offs, including whether to leave the workforce entirely to care for their children. The solution could be to combine these services under one roof. Co-locating affordable housing and child care is a particularly promising solution. In fact, several cities and counties have approved new mixed-use developments that bring together housing, child care, and other community services. Examining the experiences of local initiatives can help us better understand what role, if any, the federal government can play to support the co-location of affordable housing and child care. This blog post will lay the foundation for future research that digs deeper into co-location as one way to address these critical needs for families. Affordable Housing Remains Out of Reach for Low-Income Households with Children A persistent lack of available and affordable homes nationwide has driven up rent and homeownership costs, disproportionately impacting low-income households. Americans are increasingly cost-burdened, with nearly half of all renters paying more than 30% of household income on housing as a result. This has significant implications for households with children. Roughly 30% of children across the country lived in households with a high housing cost burden in 2022—a rate unchanged since 2019. Low-income households—those making under 80% of the area median—are even more susceptible to high housing cost burdens: 61% of low-income parents had housing costs more than 30% of their household incomes. Despite these cost burdens, only one in five low-income families with children eligible for federal housing assistance actually receive it, largely due to funding limitations. The limitations in financial assistance received, coupled with high costs, place additional strain on low-income families and contribute to housing instability. The lack of affordable housing near places of employment forces many low-wage working families to move farther from their jobs and endure lengthier commutes. Others remain in under-resourced communities, missing out on neighborhoods with better jobs and schools and creating additional barriers to long-term economic wellbeing. While affordable housing is crucial for working families, it is only one part of the equation. Lack of Available, Affordable Child Care Has Financial Repercussions for Low-Income Families There is not enough child care supply to meet demand, particularly for lower-income families. In most states, BPC found a larger child care gap—where potential demand for formal child care exceeds the number of child care slots available— in low-income census blocks, where more than 50% of the population earns less than 85% of the area median income. Fifty-four percent of low-income parents (household income of less than $50,000) delayed major life purchases, such as a house or car, to afford child care. Lack of access to affordable child care also impacts parents’ ability to remain in the workforce. In one survey of parents, more than two-thirds said child care affected their&hellip;",

    "content": "Artificial intelligence is only for tech experts. Artificial intelligence will replace my job. Artificial intelligence will lead to a dystopian future. The adoption of artificial intelligence can drive innovation and economic growth. Despite this potential, public opinion around AI is often fraught with misconceptions, debates, and concerns. Public misunderstanding and mistrust of AI—which often stems from valid concerns over risks of misuse, bias, or errors—are critical barriers to AI adoption. When communities are not well-informed on AI fundamentals, AI-enabled products and services may have less public support. This blog outlines actionable pathways to increase AI education and training across communities, including several bipartisan proposals currently under consideration in Congress. The U.S. Department of Education’s recent guide on responsible AI use identified a core message for developers, educators, and other groups leveraging AI: building trust is a shared responsibility. BPC recently highlighted the growing need for AI literacy as a critical element to building trust. AI literacy helps consumers understand when they are interacting with AI, how the technology works (both its benefits and risks), and the ethical implications of widespread AI adoption across society. Building an AI-literate population is crucial for public confidence, national competitiveness, workforce preparedness, and online safety in an increasingly digital world. Congress recognizes the importance of AI skills and knowledge but has struggled to implement effective educational initiatives; however, there is increasing momentum to implement AI training programs for people of all ages, education levels, and occupations. To this end, lawmakers in the 118th Congress have introduced several bipartisan bills, including: H.R. 6791 &#8211; Artificial Intelligence Literacy Act of 2023 S. 4394 &#8211; NSF AI Education Act S. 4838 &#8211; Consumers LEARN AI Act S. 4596 &#8211; Artificial Intelligence Public Awareness and Education Campaign Act Building AI Skills: A Community Action Plan As AI-powered tools and services proliferate across society, communities must ensure that the public is equipped to understand and properly use the technology. Communities must adopt a proactive approach to fostering AI skills that can reach consumers in local, community-specific ways through existing educational pathways and institutions. Here’s how different sectors can contribute: Schools (K-12, Higher Education, Community Colleges) Could AI soon become as important a subject to teach in schools as reading, writing, and math? As AI tools and concepts become more integrated into academic settings, both teachers and students must gain knowledge, training, and experience using AI. Educators are grappling with methods to integrate AI into schools in safe, equitable, and ethical ways. According to polling by Common Sense Media, teens are optimistic about the future of AI in schools, but also concerned about the potential it creates for academic dishonesty, skill loss, inaccurate information, and bullying. To address these challenges, educators need ongoing professional training on AI fundamentals. Programs like Code.org’s online learning series offer valuable guidance for educators to teach AI best practices and promote students’ critical thinking skills related to AI. Enhancing students’ knowledge of AI will vary across grade levels. As children increasingly engage with AI through various&hellip;",

    "content": "For decades, the standard rhythm for members of the House of Representatives has been to fly into Washington on Monday evening and depart on Thursday afternoon, causing legislative and oversight work to be jammed into just three days. Sometimes the work week gets even shorter when political dynamics cause floor votes to be canceled. The result is members of Congress end up overbooked when they are in Washington and spend more time traveling than in session. Many members of Congress recognize this problem, and over the past few years have proposed alterations to make the congressional calendar more effective and efficient. Proposals come in numerous varieties. Some propose a two weeks on, two weeks off rotation. Others call for a five-day work week at varying intervals. As we have previously, BPC proposes an alternative calendar for the coming year that: 1) reduces member travel time while also increasing the time available for legislative work in Washington; 2) maintains the traditional August recess; and 3) provides ample time in district for constituent work and campaign activities. Our proposed 2025 House calendar provides for 20 additional full session days and 18 fewer travel days as compared to the official 2023 House calendar which is the most recent non-election year comparison. Fixing the overall calendar to provide more legislative and district work days with fewer travel days would be an important step in the right direction. However, it is equally important to consider Congress’s internal schedule when it is in Washington. As the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress identified, a chief concern is the number of committee meeting conflicts that members face. Often double- or triple-booked, members are forced to “ping pong” from hearing to hearing which limits their ability to participate fully in committee business. The House has taken numerous steps to address committee conflicts. At the start of the 118th Congress, at the direction of chamber leaders, the House Digital Service (HDS) developed its Deconflict tool for committee schedulers to see when their members had meeting conflicts to make scheduling around them easier. More recently, HDS has begun rolling out a new platform, HouseCal, to expand on that deconfliction tool by incorporating additional demands on member time and other expanded functionality. While improving technology is essential for Congress to progress on this issue, alone it is not enough.  As the figure below shows, the number of committee scheduling conflicts increased from the 117th to the 118th Congress. Efforts to boost congressional capacity often focus on strengthening congressional committees. Encouraging more robust and expansive committee operations likely means members will need to spend more time in committee, making the need to solve this problem even more pressing. We recommend the following, in addition to the calendar above, to reduce the number of committee meeting conflicts and provide the institution with the most effective and efficient schedule possible. 1) The House should adopt block scheduling for committees. As previously shown, an optimized block schedule can be achieved using members’ existing committee&hellip;",

Our 50-state analysis found that election officials are well prepared to administer safe and secure elections in 2024, despite the prevailing narrative that turnover is spurring a crisis in election administration. It is true that election official turnover increased following 2020, but that increase was a slight uptick in a continuation of a long-running trends; election official turnover has been slowly increasing for two decades. Over this period, election officials’ duties have grown more complex, officials have faced increased hostility, and the workforce has gotten older. However, the data also suggests that election officials are prepared to administer the upcoming election safely, securely, and accurately. 65% of chief election officials who will oversee elections in 2024 have experience running a presidential election. In jurisdictions where there has been recent turnover, new chief election officials enter with an average of eight years prior experience in election administration (for example, as a deputy in the same department). In large jurisdictions, new officials enter with an average of 11 years of prior experience. 43 states also offer statewide training to election officials, which provides officials and their staffs with information on state-specific laws, policies, procedures, and best practices for election administration. Despite increasing turnover, American voters can have confidence that local election officials are well-equipped with the experience and training they need to administer safe and secure elections this November.",

    "content": "Long lines at polling places have garnered national attention, especially in the 2012 and 2020 presidential elections. Long lines are not the norm for most voters, and election administrators have worked hard to shorten wait times. Most voters wait fewer than 30 minutes to vote: in 2022, the average Election Day voter waited just six minutes before casting their ballot. Generally, wait times to vote have decreased since 2008. The 2020 election saw wait times increase due to the challenges of administering an election during the pandemic and a record turnout of 66.6% of eligible voters. If we see turnout that high again in 2024, more than 162 million ballots will be cast by Election Day. This blog outlines strategies to avoid potentially long wait times to cast your ballot. Voters at some polling places still face long lines and wait times. In Tennessee, Florida, and the District of Columbia, more than 10% of voters waited more than 30 minutes to cast their ballots in the 2022 election. Average wait times are consistently longer in precincts with a high percentage of minority voters, more renters, and lower incomes. News coverage of long lines may also unintentionally diminish voter participation—research shows voters who see media reports of long lines at polling places may get discouraged and stay home in future elections. Below are several strategies to avoid lines on Election Day for voters who are concerned about long wait times at the polls. Avoid the morning rush: On Election Day, lines at polling places tend to be longer right when polls open. The lines then dissipate throughout the day. Voters hoping for shorter wait times should consider going to the polls after the morning rush. Vote early in person: 47 states and the District of Columbia offer in-person early or in-person absentee voting, beginning anywhere from three days to 46 days before Election Day. Voters who wish to avoid long wait times during early voting should aim to vote in the middle of their state’s early voting period, as lines tend to be longer on the first and last day of early voting. Vote by mail: 28 states offer “no-excuse” absentee voting, meaning that any voter can request a mail ballot. Eight states and the District of Columbia conduct elections entirely by mail, meaning every voter receives a mail ballot. The remaining 14 states require voters to provide a valid excuse to qualify for an absentee ballot. Track wait times: A few local election offices have begun offering tools to track wait times at voting sites. BPC recommends that more jurisdictions collect and publish wait times, as this data can both help voters choose when to go to the polls and help election officials allocate resources more effectively in future elections. and help election officials allocate resources more effectively in future elections. Stay in line: If voters are in line when polls close, they have the right to stay in line and cast their ballots.",

    "content": "BPC’s Child Welfare Initiative created an important new work group to examine a highly complex topic and top priority in the child welfare field: differentiating poverty from neglect. When poverty is mistaken for neglect, it can lead to families’ unnecessary involvement in child welfare systems, and numerous studies have shown that this involvement is more likely to occur for poor and low-income families. When neglect is mistaken as poverty, children&#8217;s safety may be put at risk. A confluence of system reform initiatives, attention to data and broad-based parent advocacy have focused policymakers’ attention on this issue in recent years. In early interviews and focus groups assessing the child welfare landscape before the initiative launched, we discovered a bipartisan appetite for more work on differentiating between poverty and neglect. Republican and Democratic legislators in 24 states introduced 41 bills in 2022-2023 addressing state definitions of neglect and related issues that govern decisions related to child protective services (CPS) investigations. Federal policymakers are also focusing their attention on how allegations and definitions of neglect impact child welfare systems. BPC’s Differentiating Poverty from Neglect work group will meet frequently over the next 18-24 months to assess how to best define and operationalize policies and practices relating to neglect. They will examine data and research, review and analyze existing programs and guidelines, and ultimately identify and recommend steps to improve reporting, investigating, and responding to allegations of neglect. Members of the work group reflect the broad range of perspectives related to understanding the relationship between poverty and neglect. A sample of those perspectives are: Expert A: Too many families, particularly families of color, are involved in the child welfare system due to poverty-related circumstances rather than child neglect. Those suggesting that families are unnecessarily being subjected to child welfare intervention point to data showing 70%-80% of reports to child welfare authorities include an allegation of neglect; almost half of those reports are screened out by authorities and under 20% of children who are subjects of an investigation have substantiated allegations. In addition, data show significant racial disparities at every child welfare decision point. Expert B: Neglect has serious consequences for child development and warrants attention from child welfare agencies. Families reported for neglect face challenges beyond poverty that often include issues related to the parents such as substance abuse, mental health or family violence. Data on reports and substantiation of child maltreatment do not provide an accurate assessment of children’s experiences, and financial resources are not a guarantee of completely addressing neglect in the home. Expert C: Our child welfare system has dual responsibilities: to keep children safe and help strengthen families. This can be challenging, particularly when serving families who are fearful of or who distrust child protective service agencies.

    "content": "Housing policy has become a central issue in the upcoming presidential election, with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump offering proposals to address our nation’s housing supply and affordability challenges. While both have put forward policies that would support homebuyers and expand the supply of affordable homes, their plans diverge significantly in key areas like housing finance, renter protections, and immigration. Here’s a look at the housing proposals from each side. Helping Homebuyers Both Trump and Harris have proposed tax policies to support first-time homebuyers. Harris&#8217; plan includes $25,000 in down payment assistance, with more generous subsidies for first-generation homeowners. This proposal goes beyond the $10,000 tax break proposed by the Biden administration. The Trump campaign remains less specific, though the Republican platform emphasizes that the party would “promote homeownership through tax incentives that support first-time homebuyers.” This could involve tax deductions for mortgage interest and mortgage insurance or tax credits. Housing Supply Harris has emphasized the need to increase the supply of homes for both sale and rent, establishing a goal of building three million new affordable homes over the next four years. She has supported proposals to expand the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and create a new tax credit to build or rehabilitate owner-occupied housing in lower-income communities—known as the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit. Her plan also includes a new tax incentive for developers building starter homes for first-time homebuyers. Additionally, Harris has proposed a $40 billion fund to help local governments innovate in housing construction. With the proposals for expanding LIHTC and creating a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit enjoying bipartisan support in Congress, it is possible that a second Trump administration would pursue these policies as well. Trump has also pledged to reduce regulatory hurdles to building new homes, and both campaigns have put forth plans to make federally owned land available for housing development. Zoning Regulations Harris and Trump have both recognized the impact of zoning regulations on restricting the supply of housing. Harris has pledged to &#8220;take down barriers and cut red tape&#8221; to accelerate housing construction, including streamlining the permitting process for transit-oriented development and office-to-residential conversions. Trump has indicated an interest in easing environmental and permitting rules, recognizing that regulatory compliance makes up a significant percentage of the cost of building new housing. In his previous administration, he signed an executive order to create the White House Council on Eliminating Barriers to Affordable Housing Development, whose report could guide his policy in a second term. Among a variety of suggestions, the report emphasizes the importance of streamlining the federal environmental review process for affordable housing and the need to improve the regulation of manufactured housing. During his first term, Trump suspended and eventually repealed the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, vowing to prevent low-income housing development in suburban areas. He has reiterated this stance during the current campaign, promising to keep such developments away from suburban neighborhoods. While HUD released&hellip;",

    "content": "The U.S. has a housing shortage from years of underbuilding, leading to increasingly unaffordable housing costs. While overall housing construction has not kept up with demand, entry-level or “starter” homes for first-time homebuyers are in especially short supply. Factory-built housing, which includes various construction techniques and products, could help fill the supply gap. However, increasing the supply of factory-built housing would require a concerted effort to reform land use and zoning policies that restrict their broader adoption. What is factory-built housing? Unlike traditional site-built housing, where construction materials are brought to a site and assembled, factory-built housing is assembled in a factory, then shipped to a site and installed. A variety of terms are used to describe different types of factory-built housing and related construction techniques. Below is a table of key terms and definitions. Manufactured housing is a specific type of factory-built housing that meets national standards set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), known as the HUD Code. This code generally preempts local building codes, allowing manufactured housing to be produced at scale and marketed nationwide. Although federal preemption of state and local codes benefits HUD-code-compliant manufactured housing, local governments, in particular, significantly influence where these homes can be placed within their jurisdictions. The HUD Code does not apply to modular or other types of factory-built housing. These homes must adhere to the specific local codes of the final location, regardless of where they are produced. Key Terms and Definitions Factory-built housing or prefabricated housing refers to homes constructed either fully or partially in a factory and then assembled onsite. This category includes manufactured and modular homes. Off-site construction is the process of building a home, either fully or partially, in a factory, rather than constructing it entirely on a lot. Manufactured housing refers to a complete house constructed off-site in a factory to meet HUD Code requirements, allowing it to be transported anywhere in the country. Manufactured homes are built on a permanent chassis which is used to transport them but can be placed on a traditional foundation at their final location. Mobile homes are manufactured homes built before June 15, 1976, when the HUD Code went into effect. These homes cannot be retroactively brought into compliance with the HUD Code and are therefore considered separate from modern manufactured homes, which meet current HUD requirements. Modular housing consists of large pieces (or modules) of a home including not only walls, floors, and ceilings, but plumbing, wiring, and interior finishes as well. These modules are built in a factory and then transported to their final location, where they are assembled on a traditional foundation. Modular homes are built to meet local code requirements. Panelized construction involves fully building the walls of a home, or panels, in a factory and then transporting them to the building site. At the site, the panels are put together and finished similarly to a site-built home, and the structure is placed on a traditional foundation. Pre-cut construction involves cutting all&hellip;",

What can policymakers do to help Americans better afford safe housing and health insurance? What policies would help small business owners remain competitive in emerging industries and create jobs? Elections always come with big promises, but the reality is that the next president and Congress will struggle to keep those while managing our country’s finances. Already, one-fifth of the taxes the government collects goes directly to must-pay interest on past debts. Add to that the more than $4.1 trillion in mandatory spending expected next year, and there is little left for housing assistance, research and development, keeping our air and water clean, and other priorities. Debt held by the public now stands at over $28 trillion—equal to the entire value of our country’s economic output this year—and economists see no end to its rapid growth.  In the coming months, BPC will examine the impact of inaction on many policies and programs if the country remains on a fiscally unsustainable path. What might it mean to Americans if government debt starts crowding out investments in the economy? What can be learned from recent economic data about how growing debt affects housing supply and access to homeownership? What workforce investments, including wraparound supports like childcare, might get squeezed if the federal government delays the necessary fiscal adjustments? How could America’s national security and global standing be diminished if its creditors lose faith in Treasuries as a risk-free investment? Our aim is not to inject panic: there is time to act while the U.S. economy remains strong. We want to help policymakers and Americans understand the risks and the urgency, while providing solutions and a path forward. Despite these challenges, the coming years represent a unique and tremendous opportunity for the country to forge new, bipartisan consensus about how to best meet the needs of today and prevent future generations from being burdened by unsustainable debt. What’s at stake in this election is not just short-term spending priorities, but the nation’s long-term fiscal sustainability. Decisions on tax policy will not only impact individuals and businesses, but also America’s ability to invest in a wide range of priorities including national security, economic opportunity, and more.",

    "content": "The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program helps more than 2.4 million low-income households affordably rent homes in the private market. Unfortunately, many landlords have dropped out of the program in recent years, citing burdensome paperwork and lengthy inspections. As a result, about 40% of voucher recipients eventually return them unused, often after waiting years to receive assistance. Direct rental assistance (DRA) is an alternative way to deliver rental subsidies to low-income families, which could reduce some of the administrative complexities of the HCV program. Under the HCV program, the public housing authority (PHA) pays a portion of a participating family’s rent directly to the landlord. Typically, the family pays 30% of its monthly income to the landlord for rent, while the PHA covers the remaining portion through a housing assistance payment. In contrast, the direct rental assistance subsidy is paid directly to the participating family. That family is then responsible for making the full rent payment to the landlord, with little or no interaction between the landlord and the PHA. By providing a rental subsidy directly to an eligible family, direct rental assistance streamlines the delivery of housing benefits. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently issued a Request for Information to gather input on the possibility of conducting a direct rental assistance pilot project. On August 27, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a virtual gathering of experts to delve into the direct rental assistance model. The panelists—Georgetown University Professor Brian McCabe; the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ Peggy Bailey; Gate House Strategies’ Hunter Kurtz; and the Philadelphia Housing Development Corporation’s Rachel Mulbry—discussed the model’s potential benefits and tradeoffs for families, landlords, and public housing authorities. They also examined some of the emerging lessons from PHLHousing+, one of the first DRA pilot programs in the country. This blog post provides an overview of the DRA model and highlights key takeaways from each panelist. The full recording of the event is available on BPC’s website. Experience with the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Fueled Greater Interest in Direct Rental Assistance The concept of direct benefits payment is not new. In the early 1970s, HUD experimented with direct subsidy payments through the Experimental Housing Allowance Program, the nation’s first federal tenant-based rental subsidy. More recently, HUD has engaged with experts and practitioners from guaranteed income pilot programs to consider reform options for the HCV program. The COVID-19 pandemic required HUD to be more flexible with the voucher program’s rules. To administer vouchers effectively during the public health emergency, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing, which oversees the HCV program, offered waivers releasing public housing authorities from certain HCV statutory and regulatory requirements. Similarly, emergency rental assistance programs during the pandemic required local governments to be creative and flexible to ensure tenants received assistance. Philadelphia, for example, drew on its experience with direct-to-tenant payments during the pandemic when structuring PHLHousing+, its direct rental assistance pilot. Direct Rental Assistance Pilot Programs May Vary Based on Community Needs With the DRA model, funding&hellip;",

We examine the initial evidence on AI adoption across the U.S. economy to inform important questions facing policymakers to help them design policies that boost U.S. competitiveness, promote inclusion, and foster innovation. We are now at a critical point at which people and firms are more systematically collecting survey data and statistics in response to the growing interest in AI technology. Several government and private sector surveys have attempted to quantify adoption rates and other data about the use of AI, which provide insights to: how widely has AI been adopted throughout the rest of the economy? What kinds of firms adopt AI, and are there major disparities in adoption across places and industry types? Further, what are the factors that drive adoption? AI Adoption is Not New AI has been a focus for many policymakers, businesses, and media outlets in recent years, but the use and adoption of AI tools is not new. Even some “modern” techniques such as neural networks— which enable calculations that find more complex relationships in data and are inspired by the human brain —have existed and been adopted by businesses for decades. For instance, Visa adopted a neural networks-based AI system as early as 1993 to detect and counter credit card fraud. While AI technology did not see widespread adoption at the time, increases in data and computing power since have made it increasingly attractive and useful. Adoption Rates Differ by Firm Size, Sector, and Geography We highlight the Census Bureau’s Business Trends Outlook Survey (BTOS) because of its relative recency, granular data, and large and representative sample size of 1.2 million U.S. businesses. However, it is important to note that the Census survey looks at the share of firms—rather than the number of individual employees—impacted by AI, which may result in lower adoption rates than expected if the largest firms are adopting AI at higher rates. For instance, if we assume every Fortune 500 firm was sampled in BTOS—which together would only account for less than 0.05% of the total firms surveyed—they may not have a significant impact on overall firm adoption rates despite together employing a significant share of the US population. AI adoption rates are not uniform across differently sized firms; the largest and smallest firms tend to adopt AI at higher rates than do medium-sized firms. The highest adoption rate was 7.2% for firms with 250 or more employees, while the second-highest adoption rate was 5.5% for firms with one to four employees. Medium-sized firms ranging from 5 to 249 employees had lower adoption rates (Figure 1). The share of firms that have adopted AI tools varies by industry, as well (Figure 2). The three sectors with the highest percent of firms adopting AI are in information (18.1%);  professional, scientific, and technical services (12%); and educational services (9.1%), while those with the lowest uptake are construction (1.4%);&hellip;",

This regular election schedule has persisted through periods of great uncertainty and upheaval, including the Great Depression, and two World Wars. Historically, unprecedented times have not stopped Americans from voting. The United States does not have a national election body responsible for conducting elections. Instead, state and local officials are responsible for voting and must conduct elections in accordance with all federal and state laws. Primary elections are set by states and localities, which is the reason they are more easily postponed when problems arise. While Election Day is November 5 this year, this date really represents the last day you can cast a vote. You may have options in your state to vote by mail or to vote during a period of early voting before Election Day. There are currently 47 states and the District of Columbia that offer an option for early voting. Time periods vary from state to state, with an average time length of 27 days before Election Day and ending a few days prior to the election. Some states even offer early voting options the weekend before Election Day. Early voting has its benefits—it helps reduce the chance of long lines on Election Day, and also provides in-person polling options for voters with accessibility needs without having to vote on Election Day. Disinformation campaigns about voting are not new, and these efforts have ramped up in recent years.

    "content": "The calls you usually hear on election night are just projections, not final results. Media organizations, unlike election officials, call races when they believe enough unofficial vote-counting information is released to determine the eventual winner. On election night and in the days that follow, election officials will release updated vote counts as more votes are counted. However, state laws and practices vary on when mail ballot results, early voting results, and Election Day results are released. In states where the election night tallies reflect a very close contest, you should expect media organizations to wait to make a public projection (or “call”) of victory for one candidate until a higher percentage of ballots is counted and reported. Local and state election officials will finalize the vote count after all types of ballots are included in the tallies. State laws guide the certification timeline, but in some states, it can be several weeks after Election Day. Once the results are certified, the election is complete, barring any recount or challenge. Additionally, increases in mail voting might mean we have to wait longer to know the final results; counting mail ballots takes additional time and resources. While the eligibility of in-person voters can be verified at the polls and their ballots can be counted in real time, mail ballots require additional layers of processing, verification, and tabulation that are both time and resource intensive. The handful of states that have been voting partially or entirely by mail for years—like Oregon, Colorado, and Washington—have automated and streamlined the ballot verification and counting process. However, many states and localities have rapidly expanded their vote by mail operations since 2020. While automation can help speed up the process, it requires expensive machinery that most states do not have the money to purchase. States that don’t allow the preprocessing of absentee ballots or lack the necessary tools for automation will see delays in the reporting of unofficial results as absentee ballots are verified and counted in the days following Election Day. In addition, we are expecting to see an increase in provisional ballots cast this year, which are typically counted last, after mail-in ballots. Provisional ballots provide a backup option for voters whose eligibility is uncertain when they arrive at the polls. Provisional ballots help ensure all eligible voters can vote by allowing election officials to verify eligibility after the fact. Because of these additional steps, processing provisional ballots takes time. The additional time required to process absentee and provisional ballots may result in a gap between Election Day and the determination of a winner. Election officials will get the vote count right, and slower results reporting does not mean wrong or fraudulent results. Rather, it reflects a vote-counting process that is thorough, secure, and responsive to shifting voter needs. All Americans need to give election officials the time to do their jobs right.",

All official drop boxes should have a lock or tamper-evident seal and be subject to staff monitoring or video surveillance. Official ballot drop boxes provided by government representatives are secure and reliable. When in doubt, you can confirm official drop box locations with your local elections office. If a voter submits more than one mail ballot or tries to vote in person after already voting by mail, only one ballot will be counted.",

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center is partnering with ReUp Education, an organization that specializes in re-engaging adult learners and supporting their return to college, for a short series of blog posts that examine why re-enrollment of stopout learners matters and how states and institutions can empower adult students to complete college. Previously, we discussed how postsecondary institutions can re-engage stopout students—the nearly 42 million American adults who have amassed college credits but have not earned a degree. But empowering stopouts to return to college is much easier said than done: Fewer than 3% of stopout learners re-enrolled in 2022-23. In recent years, states and institutions have launched a range of initiatives to address this issue. Here, the Bipartisan Policy Center and ReUp Education identify key barriers that prevent stopouts from re-enrolling and discuss how institutions, states, and others can collaborate to help these learners complete their degree or credential. Institutional Barriers Re-engaging stopout learners at scale requires states and institutions to connect proactively with former students and build a clear pathway to facilitate their return to college. Research suggests that personalized outreach can recruit students back, but most institutions devote little effort to re-engaging stopout learners. Or they focus their efforts only on recent stopouts. Or they lack current data on their former students. Or they reach out only to their own students—which hardly helps a former student who now lives in a different part of the state or country. Effective outreach to stopout students from other institutions requires collaboration and data-sharing. Although working adults constitute an ever-growing share of the college population—40% of today’s undergraduates also work full time—institutional policies still revolve around the demands of traditional students, not the needs of adult or returning learners. For example, programs may offer inflexible class times scheduled during normal working hours or fail to provide consistent alternative scheduling options. For returning learners, restrictive transfer credit policies can make it difficult for them to re-enroll at an institution other than the one at which they started. Some returning students have stranded credits—academic credits they earned but cannot access because of unpaid balances. Others might encounter new degree requirements that require them to take additional courses that extend the time to complete their credential. Individual Challenges Stopped-out learners have multiple motivations for returning to college. Many are focused on advancing their careers and increasing their earnings. Others have the more personal goal of finishing what they started and earning their degree or credential. A recent Strada-Gallup Education Survey found that 44% of adults with some college experience but no degree say they need more education to advance their careers, while other surveys indicate that a similar percentage say they have plans to pursue education within the next five years. But when stopouts re-enroll, they run up against many of the same barriers that might have caused them to leave college in the first place. Affordability is a perennial challenge, yet most college promise programs that provide qualifying students with tuition-free enrollment opportunities are only&hellip;",

    "content": "As the end of the 118th Congress approaches with only eight legislative weeks left this year, it is worth taking stock of what has transpired. Much of the coverage of Congress, as usual, has been focused on the dysfunction of the past two years. There were multiple battles for Speaker of the House, relatively few legislative achievements, and numerous impeachment, censure, and expulsion attempts. Dysfunction and drama, while headline-grabbing, do not account for the many positive developments of the last two years—ones that suggest Congress can and does “do better” than what we see in the news. Discussions of the progress made towards increasing congressional capacity and institutional functionality are often divorced from the bigger picture of a Congress that is otherwise polarized and gridlocked. The current Modernization Subcommittee and the former Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress can, at times, appear to be unicorns in a chamber traditionally described as being populated with work horses and show horses. But a closer look at recent improvements suggests that the way congressional modernizers have approached their work can be successfully modeled across the legislative branch. The Modernization Committee argued in its final report that a key factor to the committee’s success was how it conducted its business. Hearings were formatted to encourage policy learning and deliberation and minimize opportunities for grandstanding by ditching the dais and sitting in the round with alternating seating between members of each party, as well as dispensing of the five-minute rule to allow more free-flowing discussion between members and witnesses. This mode of operating was so instrumental that the Select Committee made several recommendations encouraging all House committees to experiment with alternative hearing operations. Some on Capitol Hill are following their lead. In the 117th Congress, the most tangible example of committees embracing this ethos was when the Select Committee on Economic Disparity and Fairness in Growth held a bipartisan agenda-setting retreat. This Congress, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has formed multiple bipartisan “policy working groups,” one on critical minerals and one on fentanyl, that have experimented in several important ways. First, each group has held multiple bipartisan agenda-setting meetings to scope their work in a way that ensures productivity and consensus building. Importantly, the working groups have focused on weighing alternative policy solutions rather than attempting to define policy problems. As Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA), head of the Fentanyl Working Group, stated, the objective is to “ensure the Select Committee policy recommendations are enacted into law, as well as ensure tangible and attainable solutions are achieved.” Similarly, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), ranking member of the Critical Minerals Working Group, has said bipartisan collaboration has helped the group focus on “durable policy proposals.” Research has shown that focusing on policy proposals and solutions—rather than trying to define policy problems and assign blame—can reduce partisan grandstanding in meetings. Second, the roundtables held by each group have not been conducted using a formal dais. Instead, much like the Modernization Committee, members sit in the&hellip;",

    "content": "The passage of two emergency savings provisions as part of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 underscores Congress&#8217;s clear recognition of emergency savings&#8217; critical role in enhancing retirement security and overall financial well-being. As of January 1, 2024, these provisions—optional for plan sponsors—are now in full effect and are beginning to impact savers and the financial services industry. One change that some plan sponsors have incorporated allows certain defined contribution (DC) retirement plan participants to withdraw up to $1,000 for an emergency, penalty-free. Participants must replenish the withdrawn amount before a subsequent emergency distribution is allowed during the following three years. The second provision allows DC plan sponsors to automatically enroll workers into “pension-linked emergency savings accounts” (PLESAs) at up to 3% of post-tax pay alongside retirement account contributions. Employees can opt out or change their contribution, and the account balance is limited to $2,500 (not counting any employer contributions). Savers can withdraw funds from the PLESA tax-free and penalty-free at any time. Beginning in 2023, the Bipartisan Policy Center and Commonwealth initiated a series of discussions, as part of BlackRock’s Emergency Savings Initiative, with congressional staff, federal agency officials, private-sector practitioners, employers, and policy experts to evaluate the current emergency savings policy landscape and the impact of SECURE 2.0 while charting a vision for continued progress. These roundtable conversations—the most recent of which happened in June 2024—have yielded three major takeaways for policymakers: According to recordkeepers, the $1,000 withdrawal provision has seen interest among plan sponsors due to its administrative simplicity, but only a small cohort of early adopters have acted on that interest and added the provision to their plan. Among those that have added the $1,000 withdrawal provision, it remains unclear      how many are marketing the feature to participants. Plan participants would benefit from improvements to the user experience, and the policy community has yet to fully estimate the provision’s impact on retirement security and financial well-being. Some plan sponsors have expressed interest in the potential benefits to employees of offering PLESAs, but most recordkeepers and plan sponsors are hesitant to move forward. Stakeholders are coalescing around key reform options that could simplify PLESAs and make them much more attractive for plan sponsors, recordkeepers, and employees. Lawmakers’ recent emphasis on emergency savings has magnified its role as a potential employee benefit, leading to growth in the market for programs administered by third parties separate from retirement plan recordkeepers (also known as “out-of-plan” emergency savings accounts). Congress now has the opportunity to create parity in the emergency savings policy landscape by allowing out-of-plan accounts to leverage key automatic enrollment features like their PLESA counterparts. Doing so would especially support those workers who currently lack access to workplace retirement plans. Employers have various options to help workers cover emergency expenses. Option Ease of Implementation Challenges $1,000 withdrawal Easy to implement Improving communication and execution of withdrawal and repayment options PLESA Complex and more costly to implement than other options, such as the $1,000 withdrawal and out-of-plan options Simplifying administration&hellip;",

    "content": "As of 2019, 497 Americans each held more than $25 million in their IRAs. When considering both IRAs and defined contribution (DC) plans such as 401(k)s, approximately 130,000 households had accumulated at least $5 million in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. In stark contrast, median holdings are just $87,000 among the 54% of U.S. households with any savings at all in retirement accounts. The billions of taxpayer dollars spent annually on retirement tax incentives for Americans who have already achieved immense financial security is hugely inefficient and goes well beyond policymakers’ intention of promoting retirement preparedness. Tax Advantages for Retirement Savings: Valuable but Untargeted Over the years, Congress has established and expanded significant tax incentives to encourage individuals who might otherwise not save (or save insufficiently) to put away money for their retirement. Individuals can save income in traditional IRAs and DC plans before that income is taxed, allowing larger amounts to benefit from compound growth before the government taxes withdrawals as normal income in retirement. Alternatively, savers can contribute to Roth IRAs and DC plans on a post-tax basis, and those contributions grow and are withdrawn tax-free in retirement. These tax incentives likely help millions of Americans save more for retirement than they otherwise would, but a small group of wealthy individuals have leveraged them to accumulate enormous tax-advantaged balances, mostly in IRAs. In 2019, the aggregate balance of “mega-IRAs”—those with a balance greater than $5 million—was $280 billion. Of this total, over $40 billion is held in Roth IRAs, meaning that this amount and any returns are exempt from future taxation. These mega-IRAs cost taxpayers billions of dollars while doing little to advance retirement security. IRA Balances by Number of Taxpayers (2019) IRA Balance as of 2019 Number of Taxpayers Between $5 million and $10 million 24,990 Between $10 million and $15 million 2,275 Between $15 million and $25 million 853 $25 million and above 497 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation (2021) Strategies to Accumulate Mega-IRAs Out of Reach for Most Thousands of Americans accumulate millions of dollars in IRAs despite the annual contribution limit of $7,000 in 2024, or $8,000 for those 50 years or older. (These limits are indexed to inflation.) To generate even $5 million via rollovers from DC plans—which have higher contribution limits of $23,000 and $30,500, respectively, in 2024—an IRA owner would need to make large contributions consistently over decades. Instead, owners of mega-IRAs likely use alternate strategies involving investments not available to most taxpayers. One strategy involves company founders issuing non-publicly traded shares at an artificially low initial price—often less than one cent per share. Only a very small number of investors can purchase these nonpublic shares, which can yield enormous returns for even moderately successful companies. Another method used at private equity firms and hedge funds is to build large IRA balances through carried interest, which is the share of an investment firm’s profits paid as incentive compensation to a general partner of the fund and often distributed among key employees.

To understand the scale of the problem of noncompletion in postsecondary education, it’s best to put the figures into context. America’s colleges and universities currently enroll about 15 million undergraduates. The number of American adults who enrolled in college but never completed a degree (“stopout learners”) is almost three times as large—42 million as of 2022, according to the latest figures from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. That supersized figure highlights a massive amount of unrealized educational investment that acts as a drag on individuals and the nation. It also points to enormous potential to unleash: imagine if so many people, some already so close to finishing a degree, are able to complete college. Rarely, however, have policymakers and institutional leaders paid enough attention to this issue. As the scope of the systemic stopout problem has become more evident—and as undergraduate enrollments sagged during the pandemic—governments and institutions have taken tentative steps to engage stopout students. Colleges hoping to increase headcounts have started trying to re-enroll adult learners. At the same time, several states, hoping to address workforce and skill gaps in a tight labor market, have implemented programs to encourage some stopout students to return to school. Why Stopout Learners? The stopout challenge looms large over higher education. Only about 60% of students who begin a bachelor’s degree finish within six years. The results are worse for community colleges, where nearly half of students leave without a credential or transferring to a four-year institution. Most surveys find that cost and affordability are among the top reasons for stopping out. Students also cite academic problems, mental health issues, emotional stress, childcare, a need to work, and a lack of belonging as reasons for leaving school. In many cases, students report that their college does not provide the support or guidance they need to succeed. Indeed, navigating the unfamiliar institution of college can be difficult, especially for those from under-resourced backgrounds or who are the first in their family to enroll. The financial consequences of stopping out can be severe. Despite ongoing debates over the value of higher education, research consistently shows that college usually pays off if students complete their degree or credential. But those who leave before finishing often find themselves worse off than had they not enrolled in the first place, as they incur the up-front costs of attending college but do not reap the wage premium that comes with a degree or credential and are more likely to find themselves unemployed relative to college graduates. Consequently, stopout students are more likely than completers to struggle with repaying their student loans and more than twice as likely to default.

    "content": "An American Congressional Exchange (ACE) trip to Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District saw Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA), a physician, visit Rep. French Hill (R-AR) in Little Rock, where they dove deep into workforce challenges, health care services and delivery, and artificial intelligence—issues critical for our nation’s future and ripe for bipartisan action. Labor shortages are endemic in the health care industry in Rep. Bera’s Sacramento County district, a challenge shared by Rep. Hill’s district encompassing central Arkansas. Additionally, the lawmakers serve together on the House of Representatives’ bipartisan Task Force on Artificial Intelligence. The tone was set at an opening dinner where state officials presented the recently released Arkansas Workforce Strategy, a “collaborative, competency-based, customer-centric, and responsive workforce system that meets current and future needs of employers, incumbent workers, and job seekers.” Presenters noted that for the mutual benefit of businesses and employees alike, identifying employer requirements is an important prerequisite to provide necessary skills for Arkansans. Understanding how to amass and employ relevant data, respond quickly in a rapidly shifting labor market, and effectively deliver practical training are among the other keys to success. The following day, activities and discussions highlighted topical issues across workforce, health, and technology policy. Beginning with a visit to the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, the policymakers were briefed on the history and economic landscape of the metropolitan area. Local bankers illuminated opportunities and challenges surrounding AI adoption and financial technology (“fintech”), such as how AI could potentially be harnessed to catch fraudulent activity (particularly to address what was cited as an increased volume of check fraud). One representative of a community financial institution recalled how, despite supposedly rapid developments in fintech, banking technologies—especially for smaller lenders—still aren’t ready. Further, adding and integrating new systems into existing “core” ones can be difficult to navigate, and community-oriented banks frequently lack the resources necessary to ensure a smooth transition. Local banks are also reluctant to adopt new technologies due to the associated legal risks and liabilities. Several at the roundtable remarked that, in an age when data is a “gold mine,” customers want to know how they can trust their bank with their information. All these perspectives were valuable for the two lawmakers as they contribute to bipartisan efforts in Congress to responsibly govern AI while fostering innovation. Next, the lawmakers embarked on a tour of the Port of Little Rock, where they discussed workforce challenges and technology development in the world of logistics. The port is part of the McClellan-Kerr Navigational System on the Arkansas River, stretching over 400 miles from Tulsa to the Mississippi River and into the Gulf of Mexico. This route—along with a short-line railroad and quick interstate access for overland shipping—connects Little Rock to the world, and the port’s surrounding industrial park employs 4,500 Arkansans in 40 businesses ranging from peanut butter to primary metals. Reps. Bera and Hill learned about what it takes to keep the country moving and discussed workforce challenges, technology, and the road ahead for logistics and associated&hellip;",

    "content": "Several federal agencies have been tasked by Congress with bolstering America’s critical mineral supply chains: the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense’s Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS). But which minerals are considered “critical?” It’s complicated. Rather than establishing a unified list of critical minerals, statute requires each agency to develop its own list based on methodologies and goals specific to their focus: national security for DLA, energy infrastructure for DOE, and domestic resources for USGS. This results in some minerals being included on some agency lists while being excluded from others, which in turn determines which federal benefits different types of critical mineral projects are eligible for. In addition to agency lists, the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (45X) bases eligibility on a statutorily defined list of purified critical minerals, incentivizing domestic processing of critical minerals. Additionally, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) created another list of critical minerals subject to Section 301 Tariffs on imports from China. Each of these five lists is different. This blog: Identifies all the critical minerals on each list (including raw and purified); Analyzes programs and benefits eligibility criteria; Compares the methodologies and goals of the USGS’s Critical Minerals List, DOE’s Critical Materials List, and DLA’s Materials of Interest List. Note: Minerals denoted as (purified) are based on 45X’s statutory definition. The statute requires most minerals to be at least 99%+ pure to qualify. What are the benefits of appearing on a list? Inclusion can make a specific type of mineral project eligible for federal funding, subject to a streamlined permitting process, or more competitive due to fees placed on imports. These benefits impact what America’s future mineral supply chains look like. The list of benefits excludes agency studies and reporting requirements and instead focuses on programs that provide tangible financing and permitting benefits. Grants and Loans DOE Grants: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and recent appropriations established a series of grant programs to invest in early-stage critical mineral R&amp;D and strengthen supply chains. At DOE, numerous offices administer energy related critical mineral grants, including the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy (EERE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), and Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E). Eligibility for these grant programs at DOE often relies on DOE’s Critical Materials List, depending on the specific grant. DOE Loans: The DOE Loan Programs Office’s (LPO) Title 17 program can provide loan guarantees to innovative critical mineral mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling projects using the program’s $62 billion in loan authority. Critical mineral eligibility for Title 17 support is based on DOE’s Critical Material’s List. IRA Tax Credits 48C: DOE’s $10 billion Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit Program provides funding for domestic critical mineral processing and recycling projects, which is administered through a competitive process.

LaHood summarized the committee’s yearlong effort to develop their Title IV-B reauthorization bill by hearing from stakeholders, holding numerous hearings, and working in a bipartisan way: “The fact that the issue of child welfare, and this bill in particular, can be reflective of the values and priorities of so many of the different members of this committee from all degrees on the political spectrum really speaks volumes to this issue and to the work the committee has put in.”  He described the objectives of the reauthorization bill as:    Supporting early intervention to keep families together whenever possible and reduce the need for foster care  Removing ineffective requirements and ensuring state accountability   Freeing up more time for caseworkers to focus on families by reducing administrative burdens  Expanding access to tribal communities by streamlining funding   Building support systems for 2.5 million grandparents and relatives serving as kinship caregivers   Strengthening post-adoptive services to ensure children waiting for adoption find stable families  BPC fellow Rob Geen testified at a recent Ways and Means hearing and shared input on Title IV-B reauthorization. His testimony highlighted the bipartisan legislative history of federal child welfare policy, described data and key policy trends, and shared key findings from BPC’s child welfare landscape assessment.   “Bipartisanship has been a defining feature of federal child welfare legislation for decades.

All of these reforms are examples of significant bipartisan agreement.” – Rob Geen   Child welfare policymaking should account for the social and economic complexities that underpin the diverse array of challenges that exist for children and families. Nationally, about 7.5 million children a year are the subject of a report to child protective services, meaning that someone placed a call to report suspected abuse or neglect. Other data suggest that as many as 4% of children in the United States experience maltreatment in a year, with an estimated 35% to 38% of U.S. children experiencing some type of maltreatment before the age of 18.    The Title IV-B program is one of several key federal programs that states rely on to finance their child welfare systems and it represents a relatively small portion of the $31 billion spent annually by child welfare agencies.  A number of provisions in the bill align with BPC’s high priorities in the child welfare field, including:  Reauthorizing Title IV-B, Subpart 1 and Subpart 2, extending the discretionary funds for both subparts and increasing mandatory funding for Subpart 2 in FY 2026-2029.   Enhancing the Court Improvement Program&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 10, 2024, Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) led a bipartisan group of 10 Senators in introducing the Unemployment Insurance Integrity and Accessibility Act. This legislation breaks from recent partisan trends in unemployment insurance (UI) policy and comes at a time when various stakeholders seek congressional support for ongoing systemic modernization efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed UI system weaknesses in fraud prevention and accessibility, leading to the  funding provided by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in March 2021 to address these challenges. Although reforms undertaken with ARPA funding significantly improved UI administration, more work is needed. The Unemployment Insurance Integrity and Accessibility Act seeks to build on this progress by proposing reforms intended to better serve workers, employers, and state program administrators. The bill aims to strike a balance between fraud prevention and improving access to benefits for eligible workers, reflecting a holistic approach to UI modernization. Key provisions of the bill could standardize and elevate ongoing state efforts to recover funds from pandemic-era fraud and overpayments, detect and prevent future fraud, and improve program accessibility in alignment with findings from BPC’s recent engagement with state UI directors. Additionally, the legislation tasks the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study evaluating ARPA-funded investments to promote best practices and ensure efficient use of resources. Below is a breakdown of the key provisions in the bill. &nbsp; Recovering Fraud and Overpayments. As states implemented new federal emergency benefit programs during the pandemic to meet increased demand, opportunities arose for criminal actors to defraud the UI system. Additionally, numerous errors led to overpayments. The following provisions seek to assist states in recovering pandemic and non-pandemic federal funds and provide protection to genuine claimants who may face hardships returning pandemic overpayments: Extends the statute of limitations for pandemic UI fraud. Under current law, the federal statute of limitations for pandemic unemployment fraud is five years. Extending the statute of limitations gives state agencies more time to find and prosecute criminal actors, many of whom are abroad. Permits states to waive certain pandemic non-fraud overpayments. This provision protects certain individuals from the undue burden of repaying non-fraud overpayments they received, ensuring that repayments are not required when &#8220;collection would be contrary to equity and good conscience.&#8221; Allows states to retain a portion of recovered overpayments. Currently, states are unable to keep any of the federal dollars they recover. The new recovery provision changes this by allowing states to use a portion of recovered pandemic and non-pandemic overpayments to enhance program administration, including modernizing the state’s UI technology infrastructure. Fraud Prevention and Detection. Learning from shortcomings exposed by the pandemic—which resulted in anywhere from $100 billion to $280 billion in stolen funds—states have expanded their data-sharing measures and incorporated new digital tools to combat fraud. The following provisions aim to standardize data-sharing techniques and the use of new technologies across states, while also increasing the U.S. Department of Labor’s role in providing essential guidance to states&hellip;",

    "content": "Despite ongoing disaster recovery efforts and urgent hurricane and wildfire-related risks, several federal disaster assistance programs again face an uncertain fiscal outlook. Outlined below are the Biden administration’s outstanding requests for supplemental disaster funding, the key programs such funding would support, and the implications of delayed funding for disaster-impacted communities. Background On June 28, 2024, the Biden administration refreshed its October 2023 request to Congress for disaster response and recovery funding. The October request was part of a broader package addressing both domestic and foreign aid needs. Domestically, the leading consideration was $23.5 billion for communities that have faced extreme weather and climate disasters. In the months following that request, Congress struggled to find an overall solution for funding the federal government through fiscal year 2024 and a specific path forward on disaster assistance. Ultimately, Congress enacted two separate appropriations bills—one in March 2024 to provide fiscal year 2024 funding and one the following month, providing foreign aid. However, supplemental funding for response and recovery needs was not included in either spending package. The October 2023 supplemental request included $9 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) which finances many Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) programs. Concurrently, the administration proposed $2.8 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In June 2024, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reiterated the October 2023 request and outlined the need for an additional $4 billion, for a total of $27.5 billion in disaster-related appropriations. Two distinct items are noted in OMB’s explanation: the need for funding for the Department of Transportation’s Emergency Relief Fund (DOT-ER)—primarily for the replacement of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in March 2024 additional funding for the CDBG-DR program given clarity on recovery needs associated with the Maui wildfires in August 2023, as well as other qualifying disasters since early 2023 The following table provides more detail on the key funding sought for disaster response and recovery purposes (amounts in millions). Agency/Program October 2023 Request June 2024 Request Total FEMA &#8211; DRF $9,000 $0 $9,000 HUD – CDBG-DR $2,800 $700 $3,500 DOT – ER $634 $3,100 $3,734 Program Detail Of the three programs listed above, the most pressing funding need is for the DRF. FEMA’s most recent monthly financial report (through June 2024) indicated that the DRF will be in a deficit position for major disaster response by the end of August 2024 (excluding amounts for pre-disaster mitigation). As FEMA approaches this point, it will begin to implement a process known as Immediate Needs Funding (INF) to slow outflows from the DRF. FEMA describes the INF process as prioritizing “response and urgent recovery efforts without any interruption” and states that “new obligations not necessary for lifesaving and life-sustaining activities will be paused.” This approach aligns with basic federal practices during lapses in appropriations and effectively halts funding flows for a broad range of programmatic and administrative activities, including those associated with FEMA’s Public&hellip;",

    "content": "For most working families, child care is an essential expense. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is the only tax credit designed to explicitly help parents offset child care expenses, but not all families benefit equally from the credit. To be eligible to receive the credit, filers must have eligible expenses and federal income tax liability. Since the credit is nonrefundable, taxpayers without federal income tax liability are unable to benefit from the credit, limiting its impact on families most in need. In fact, only 12% of taxpayers with eligible expenses successfully claim the credit, primarily middle- and higher-income working parents. The credit is long overdue for modernization and 2025 offers a crucial policy window to adjust the CDCTC’s structure to better help parents afford child care. Why the CDCTC is Not Curbing High Child Care Costs The CDCTC was originally enacted in 1954 as a deduction for taxpayers with children and was transformed into a nonrefundable credit in 1976. It has subsequently been reformed multiple times, with several changes to the credit’s structure that were meant to keep pace with the changing child care landscape but have fallen short in recent years. Between 2000, when the credit was last updated, and 2022, child care costs increased 223%, while family incomes did not rise at a comparable pace. Since the maximum expenses are not indexed to inflation, the credit does not meaningfully offset the costs of care (the average credit is between $500 and $600). Estimated Costs of Child Care by Delivery System &nbsp; According to the most recent Department of Labor data from 2018, median prices per child varied by delivery system: County Size Infant center-based Toddler center-based Preschool center-based Infant home-based Toddler home-based Preschool home-based Small (1-99,999) $7,461 $6,760 $6,239 $5,824 $5,713 $5,541 Medium (100,000-499,999) $10,194 $8,846 $8,400 $7,800 $7,362 $7,020 Large (500,000-999,999) $13,420 $11,180 $10,078 $8,978 $8,436 $8,048 Very large (1,000,000+) $15,417 $12,121 $11,050 $9,892 $9,100 $9,019 The credit has not been meaningfully changed in over two decades. Given how rapidly the costs of child care and living are growing, and the continued impact of inflation, families who can claim the credit are finding its impact less effective. The underlying credit has effectively remained unchanged since its 2001 expansion that was made permanent in 2012 (see Table 1). In 2001 the average child care costs for a family with one child were approximately $3,500 a year. Families could claim a credit between $600 and $1,050 depending on income against $3,000 of maximum qualified expenses. The CDCTC’s purchasing power is much smaller today . Estimates suggest that, had these expenses been indexed to inflation over the past 22 years, they would be valued at nearly $5,300 (with the maximum credit possible increasing to $1,850 for one child). Even adjusted for inflation, the CDCTC is not sufficient to help families defray the costs of child care. As shown in Figure 1, the growth in child care costs well outpaced median family income and inflation. In 2023, the&hellip;",

    "content": "As of July 5, 2024, new requirements have been put in place to help protect consumers from discrimination when artificial intelligence (AI) tools are used in health care. This comes in the form of a final rule, published by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights (OCR), as part of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These changes aim to prevent AI tools and algorithms from discrimination as health care providers and insurers increasingly use algorithms for clinical care and administrative activities. Reliance on these tools without oversight could lead to discrimination among underrepresented or marginalized patients. For instance, a  2019 study revealed that a widely used algorithm assessing health care needs based on several factors, including costs, resulted in unequal care. Historically, Black patients receive less health care even when their medical needs are equivalent thus Black patients who were given the same risk scores as white patients were actually sicker. Evolution of Section 1557 Section 1557 of the ACA, enacted in 2010, aimed to strengthen civil rights protections in health care. Over successive administrations, these rules have been significantly revised—addressing a wide range of discrimination-related issues. This blog provides an overview of the AI portions. While drafting the ACA, policymakers did not anticipate the profound impact of AI on health care settings. Recognizing this gap, the Biden administration added more robust language addressing the use of AI in health care. The rule requires the use of AI tools and algorithms in health care settings, termed &#8220;patient care decision support tools,&#8221; to adhere to nondiscrimination standards. This is part of the administration’s ongoing efforts to protect patients as AI is deployed into the public sphere, and fulfill objectives outlined in the administration’s Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. Core Protections of the Rule: Prohibition of Discrimination The rule states that discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability is prohibited in certain health activities including the use of AI tools and algorithms in health care settings. Covered entities must take “reasonable steps” to identify and mitigate any potential discriminatory impacts of the AI tools and algorithms they use. If an AI tool is found to cause discriminatory treatment, then corrective actions must be taken. Entities incorporating data related to race, color, sex, age, or disability into their algorithms must ensure they do not perpetuate bias and regularly prove and reaffirm their compliance. Defining AI Tools and Algorithms The nondiscrimination rule defines “patient care decision support tools” as “any automated or non-automated tool, mechanism, method, technology, or combination thereof used by a covered entity to support clinical decision-making in its health programs or activities.” This includes: Risk Assessment Algorithms: Tools that predict health outcomes by analyzing patient data. Diagnostic Algorithms: AI that aids in diagnosing diseases using data from imaging studies, lab results, and patient records. Treatment Planning: AI that creates personalized treatment strategies.

    "content": "Voters look to election office websites for information about how to register and vote. But a bad actor can easily establish a fake election website to deceive voters, which appears to have happened in 2020. The rapid development of widely accessible generative AI tools risk making it even easier to create believable spoof websites. Thankfully, the .gov domain serves as a bulwark against impersonation attacks. Only verified U.S. government entities are eligible for a website ending in .gov, giving voters a quick and reliable way to identify official election websites and trust the accuracy of the information on them. In 2022, analysis by the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology found that only 25% of election websites used the .gov domain. As the 2024 election approaches, we find that there has been an uptick in adoption: now, 31% of election websites are on .gov. It is heartening to see that election offices are adopting .gov, but there is still a long way to go. Adoption of .gov domains has increased since 2022 but remains low We analyzed a dataset maintained by the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) consisting of websites and contact information for all local election offices across the country. We found the following changes since 2022: Of approximately 7,000 unique local election websites, the share using the .gov domain increased from 25% to 31%. (We should note that this grouping overrepresents states like Wisconsin and Michigan that administer elections at the sub-county level, such as by town.) Adoption by the approximately 3,000 websites associated with counties and county equivalents increased from 31% to 39%. Among the 20 most populous counties according to the 2020 Census enumeration—together home to over 60 million Americans—usage of the .gov domain increased from 42% to 53%. This shift is due to two of those counties—Tarrant County, TX, and Santa Clara County, CA—adopting .gov. (This analysis considers the 19 unique websites belonging to these 20 counties; Brooklyn, NY, and Queens, NY, both use vote.nyc) Why should election offices have .gov websites? Only verified government entities can administer a website with a .gov domain, which means that voters can trust the information that appears on those websites. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI recommend that all election offices adopt .gov to “help the public better recognize official government sites and emails while avoiding phishing attempts and websites that impersonate government officials.” However, the public can only be inoculated against impersonation attacks once they understand to look for .gov as an indicator of trustworthiness. That understanding can only happen once election offices adopt .gov on a widespread basis. Most election websites use domains ending in .com, .org, or .net, which anyone can purchase. Imagine that the hypothetical jurisdiction Verdant County uses the website “verdantvotes.com.” Any bad actor could register a seemingly legitimate web domain—for instance, “verdantelections.com”—and credibly pose as the local election office, populate the website with false information about results or the time, place, or manner of voting, or&hellip;",

    "content": "Worker productivity is a major driver of economic growth and competitiveness in the United States. With the rise of artificial intelligence, many businesses across industries have started experimenting with and adopting AI systems to boost worker productivity. However, separating the tangible benefits of AI from speculative hype can be challenging. In response, economists have begun analyzing the potential impacts AI may have on worker productivity. Below, we summarize what we’ve learned from the early academic literature on this topic and summarize findings from each study at the end of this piece. What We Learned About AI and Worker Productivity Research on AI and worker productivity is preliminary and examines only a tiny portion of all the tasks performed across the economy, but provides a starting point for estimating AI’s potential effects on productivity and suggests areas for future inquiry. We identified four broad findings: AI often improves net worker productivity in the limited set of tasks studied. The studies we examined control for relevant factors and measure certain performance metrics for workers with AI tools relative to those without. On average, coders using AI tools were faster when completing certain programming tasks, taxi drivers with AI tools were faster at finding customers, and call center workers resolved calls faster with AI tools. College-educated workers completed mid-level writing tasks, such as writing a press release or short report, more quickly and at a higher quality with AI tools. Consultants completed more basic consulting tasks better and faster with AI tools, though we discuss later how they performed worse on more complex tasks. Productivity gains were generally more pronounced among the least skilled and productive workers. We saw this pattern across the studies on call center workers, coders, taxi drivers, consultants (for certain tasks), and professionals engaging in mid-level writing tasks. This might be because AI systems can help quickly communicate tacit knowledge—knowledge gained through experience that is difficult to explain—to less skilled workers who benefit most from such assistance. For example, a less-skilled taxi driver might be guided towards more efficient routes for picking up passengers using an AI system that has learned from data. In contrast, a more skilled driver might already have this knowledge based on years of driving and would not benefit from—or may even be hindered by—an AI system guiding them. In fact, researchers saw a drop in call quality among high-skilled call center workers when utilizing AI tools. AI sometimes has no significant effects on—or may even reduce—net worker productivity for some of the tasks studied. On average, entrepreneurs did not see significant impacts on their performance when using AI tools. Radiologists on net did not see significant improvements in their diagnoses accuracy with AI tools, though there was considerable variation depending on the context. While consultants completed more basic consulting tasks better and faster with AI tools, they saw a drop in productivity and performed worse on more difficult tasks such as analyzing complex business cases.

    "content": "Introduced by Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act requires voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship at the time of registration. Both parties agree that voter registration should permit all eligible citizens—and only eligible citizens—to register and vote. Although instances of noncitizen registration and voting are rare, the SAVE Act’s goal of ensuring that only citizens can register to vote is important. But there are easier, more cost-effective ways to improve voter registration that don’t create new barriers for eligible voters. Here’s what you need to know about requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote: Citizenship is already a requirement to vote, but it is not always the easiest thing to prove. The SAVE Act needs more time and resources to be implemented well. There are better ways–like REAL ID and data sharing–to improve voter list accuracy. The federal government should expand state access to federal eligibility data. State legislatures are making progress on citizenship and list maintenance. Citizenship is already a requirement to vote, but it is not always the easiest thing to prove. The SAVE Act amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) by introducing a requirement for individuals to provide proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. Eligible documents include a REAL ID-compliant identification indicating U.S. citizenship; a valid U.S. passport, military ID and service record; a government-issued photo ID showing U.S. birthplace; or a government-issued photo ID that does not indicate birthplace or citizenship and a valid secondary document. The SAVE Act introduces a documentation requirement for a law that has existed for decades; the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections. The NVRA requires states to use a common voter registration form, which includes an attestation under penalty of perjury that the applicant is a U.S. citizen. Illegal registration and voting attempts by noncitizens are routinely investigated and prosecuted by the appropriate state authorities, and there is no evidence that attempts at voting by noncitizens have been significant enough to impact any election’s outcome. Arizona began requiring proof of citizenship to vote in 2004. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the additional documentation requirements violated the Voting Rights Act, the state created a ‘federal-only list’ that permitted otherwise eligible voters who could not provide proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. Arizona’s federal-only list provides insight into how a national documentation requirement might impact voters in practice. Analysis conducted by Votebeat found that rather than noncitizens, college students and individuals experiencing homelessness—both transient populations that are more likely to lack identifying documentation—were disproportionately represented on the federal-only list. This echoes research by the Brennan Center for Justice, VoteRiders, the University of Maryland Center for Civic Democracy and Engagement (CDCE), and Public Wise, which found that “more than 9 percent of American citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, don’t have proof of citizenship readily available.” The SAVE Act does include an&hellip;",

    "content": "Governments are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) tools to streamline operations and transform public services delivery; opportunities to use them to improve tax administration are no exception. As part of its 2023 Strategic Operating Plan, the IRS identified AI models and data management as a priority to enhance operations and innovation ahead of 2025. As AI is increasingly integrated into tax administration, policymakers should establish guardrails to ensure secure and appropriate data use. This blog builds off BPC’s latest research examining efforts to improve tax administration through technology and data sharing. Only Scratching the Surface Today, 65% of global tax administration authorities acknowledge AI’s use and integration in their daily operations. The IRS has successfully used AI to automate internal processes, improve taxpayer services, and detect potential fraudulent returns through various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics for fraud and verifications. One of the most common applications of AI in tax administration is automating data retrieval and reducing manual entry of information. For instance, using the IRS’ Modernized e-File (MeF) system, optical charter recognition extracts relevant data from paper returns to upload into their databases, reducing the manual input required and the resulting backlogs. Experts see this AI use case as having the greatest potential to improve efficiency by eliminating many of the most time-consuming elements of the tax compliance process. Once an electronic return is filed, MeF validates the information before it’s transmitted to the IRS. If a return fails this validation process, the system identifies where the error occurred so that taxpayers can better pinpoint the location of their error and, where possible, input information quickly to rectify the problem. Additionally, MeF offers an integrated payment option for taxpayers to directly authorize the withdrawal of funds from their bank accounts. To supplement these systems, taxpayers can also chat with the IRS’ customer service bots to ask questions and understand changes to tax law, which has reduced calls to the IRS. AI tools can help speed up these transactions, automate processing of information, and enable more convenient customer communication methods. Another primary use of AI by the IRS has been to identify representative samples of taxpayer returns for annual audits, supplementing the manual process in which enforcement officers select returns for audits due to noncompliance concerns. The Department of Treasury recovered $375 million in fiscal year 2023 by using AI to mitigate check fraud and strengthen processes to reclaim potentially fraudulent payments, demonstrating that when used appropriately it can improve the agency’s efficiency and effectiveness. Potential Public Policy Pitfalls Lawmakers and tech leaders alike, while observing the potential of AI to improve operations and efficiency, are wary of the dangers associated with its exponential growth absent clear protocols and protections for taxpayers. When it comes to risks in tax administration, three overarching issues emerge: AI systems require adequate safeguards to prevent fraud and abuse.

    "content": "Policymakers and the public are grappling with the rise of artificial intelligence and its potential impacts on workers. Some fear massive job losses from automation while others argue these concerns are overblown, instead highlighting the potential for new job creation. Debates and anxiety around automation and jobs are not new and have occurred throughout history. In an essay from 1930, famed economist John Maynard Keynes stated, “We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come—namely, technological unemployment.” History can provide some guidance about how automation has impacted workers in the past and help us understand what is similar and different about this new wave of automation. What Makes AI Different from Past Waves of Automation? Two past waves of automation can provide useful insights: the Industrial Revolution and the Information Technology Revolution. The Industrial Revolution saw innovations like steam and electric engines automate many tasks that required physical strength and dexterity and followed an explicit set of rules, such as drilling and sewing. The Information Technology Revolution later allowed computers to automate many analytical tasks that also followed an explicit set of rules, such as sorting files by date and calculating numbers in spreadsheets. AI is different in that it can automate many tasks that do not follow an explicit set of rules and are learned through experience and intuition, such as recognizing images, drafting emails, and drawing illustrations. Modern AI mimics human intuition and learning using statistical techniques that effectively make predictions using data. For instance, an AI system can use a database of images to predict what a new image represents. These distinctions between modern AI and technologies developed during the Industrial and IT Revolutions are important for two reasons. First, if we define routine tasks as those that follow an explicit set of instruction, AI tools focus on non-routine tasks unlike the previous waves of automation. Drafting an email is a common task that some might consider routine; however, it is non-routine in that there is no explicit set of instructions that someone can follow to draft an original email. Further, some tasks that AI automates are not routine by any meaningful standard. For instance, drawing an elaborate image is a non-routine creative task that requires considerable skill and experience which was not possible to automate until the rise of generative AI. Second, while today’s AI systems can substitute for intuition and human learning in some non-routine tasks, they are not good at many others. For instance, today’s AI systems can suffer from “hallucination” problems that make them less reliable when giving factual advice. These shortcomings warrant a case-by-case approach to determining the efficacy and accuracy of AI technologies. What Impact Did Past Waves of Automation Have on Jobs? The past also provides precedent for the impacts of automation on the number and type of jobs across the labor market. If history is a guide,&hellip;",

    "content": "Only one-third of employees at small businesses—those with fewer than 100 employees—have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. To increase coverage among that one-third, Congress included robust financial support for small businesses that sponsor retirement plans in the SECURE Act of 2019 and SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022, with that support largely administered through the tax code. A small business can now receive two substantial tax credits to offset administrative costs during its first three years offering employees a retirement plan. These credits reduce the amount of taxes a small business owes dollar-for-dollar and, for most of these employers, likely offset the entire cost of launching a plan. But as lawmakers begin to consider options for a “SECURE 3.0” package in the 119th Congress, improving key policy design features could help these existing tax credits work better. Substantial Credits for Small Businesses Small businesses can receive a 50% credit—and, as of tax year 2023, those with up to 50 employees can receive a 100% credit—on all qualified startup costs for the first three years of offering a plan. Qualified costs include “any ordinary and necessary expenses” related to establishing, administering, or educating employees about the plan. The maximum annual credit is the greater of: $500; and The lesser of: $250 for each eligible non-highly compensated employee; and $5,000. In other words, the maximum annual credit can amount to $250 per employee up to a total of $5,000, with one- and two-employee businesses both eligible for a maximum credit of $500. (The credit cannot, however, exceed actual startup expenses.) In addition, provisions from the SECURE Act and SECURE 2.0 make most small businesses that launch a plan eligible for an additional $500 per year tax credit for the first three years. The SECURE Act created this tax credit for employers who introduce a plan feature automatically enrolling eligible employees in the plan. (All employees can opt out of participating in plans with auto-enrollment.) Since SECURE 2.0 required new plans (with a few exceptions—e.g., businesses with fewer than 10 employees) to include automatic enrollment, many small businesses offering new plans are automatically eligible for this credit. Small businesses are therefore eligible for tax credits of between $1,000 (for a one- or two-employee business) and $5,500 (for a 20-employee business) for three years to cover the costs of launching a plan. These credits cover most, if not all, of the cost of launching a plan, which typically starts at $1,000 to $1,500 for the smallest businesses. But these tax credits could be made even more effective. Through conversations with other stakeholders, BPC has identified three issues lawmakers should consider as they continue to explore ways to make it easier for employers to offer retirement plans. Nonprofits The most straightforward opportunity to improve these tax credits lies in their current exclusion of nonprofit employers. Most business tax credits (including the startup and auto-enrollment credits) offset an employer’s income tax liability, but nonprofit organizations do not pay income taxes and therefore cannot benefit from most&hellip;",

    "content": "Today’s ruling in Loper and Relentless dramatically shifts the dynamic between the executive and legislative branches when it comes to writing and implementing government policy. The Supreme Court overturned the “Chevron deference doctrine,” a legal principle established in 1984 which instructed courts to give federal agencies wide leeway when implementing ambiguous or vague statutes enacted by Congress. The ruling requires Congress having a more expansive role in the details of policymaking than it has become accustomed to. Now, agencies will need far more prescriptive direction from Congress when adopting regulations for carrying out legislative intent, and the legislative branch will need to improve its understanding of federal implementation and employ better foresight to achieve its goals. While the ruling creates a new standard for the executive branch, it also requires a shift in how Congress writes laws and the resources it requires to do so. All of this will require further investments in the legislative branch. Below are various pathways Congress should consider for the post-Chevron world. Implications for Congress For decades, Congress grew accustomed to leaving many implementation and rulemaking questions up to the executive branch while concerning itself with higher-level statutory outlines of federal agencies and programs. Some observers believe Chevron deference incentivized Congress to punt the finer details of divisive or complex issues from the adversarial legislative arena to the more technocratic bureaucracy, disrupting the proper separation of powers. Beyond legal and constitutional arguments, which were just litigated, this style of lawmaking is problematic, particularly in the modern digital era. As Jennifer Pahlka explains, there is a disconnect between how Congress drafts laws and how that language is interpreted by the implementers in the executive branch. Legislators often focus on detailing certain goals without thinking through how those goals will be carried out. This dynamic is one of the main reasons why Americans are often frustrated by what appears to be an unresponsive government, and why legislators are left befuddled as to why certain problems appear unfixable despite policy action and active oversight. Today’s ruling will require Congress to reexamine the level of detail it goes into when it drafts legislation. While doing so, Congress might also reconsider the language it uses in legislation to better align policy goals with downstream implementation impacts. Multiple Pathways Forward Below are several considerations Congress must weigh as it adjusts to the new policymaking environment. 1. Procedural Authorities Congress should re-examine its existing procedural and statutory mechanisms for exercising oversight and review of the administrative state. Currently, Congress has broad legislative authority over the issuance and implementation of agency rules—it can require repeal of an agency rule via statute at any time. But Congress also recognized the uniqueness of its regulatory oversight authority by enacting fast-track procedures that allow it to overturn rules via the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Under the CRA, if Congress acts on a disapproval resolution within a specified timeframe and it is signed by the president, the rule will not take effect, or if it has already&hellip;",

    "content": "Rising levels of extreme weather and climate-related risks have driven up property insurance costs in recent years, exacerbating affordability challenges for homeowners and apartment building owners alike. The Problem Insurance is a vital resource that protects homeowners from assorted risks and covers rebuilding costs after a disaster. However, in some regions, it is challenging for private insurers to provide insurance at affordable rates. To make a profit, private insurance companies must generate sufficient revenue through premiums to pay out claims for covered losses. Losses from natural disasters are becoming more costly and frequent. Wildfires, hurricanes, and other storms have inflicted increasingly catastrophic damage on our nation’s housing stock, with a record-setting 28 natural disasters in the U.S. last year which each resulted in over $1 billion in direct costs. Greater levels of risk translate to higher property insurance premiums as insurance providers raise rates to maintain profitability and ensure sufficient resources to cover future customer losses. The resulting sharp increase in insurance premiums for homeowners and property developers has exacerbated housing affordability challenges across the U.S. Several other factors have impacted insurer costs, including: rising home prices, inflation, and the increasing cost to rebuild housing higher expenses due to fraud and changes in societal expectations and legal practices that have made litigation more common and more costly a sharp rise in the cost of reinsurance—insurance purchased by insurance companies to reduce and manage risk—due in part to the very high expenses of catastrophic disasters Impact on Homeowners Nationally, property insurance rates have been on the rise for 26 consecutive quarters, starting in the last quarter of 2017. From 2017 to 2022, homeowners insurance premiums rose 40% faster than inflation. Recent estimates for the national average cost of homeowners insurance premiums range from about $1,750 to about $2,500 annually, though average rates vary widely by region. In fact, in some states, homeowners pay as much as $500 per month for insurance. For millions of households already struggling to make their mortgage payments, these monthly insurance costs are a significant burden. They can also put homeownership out of reach for prospective first-time homebuyers. As a result, many households are choosing to forego insurance and expose their assets to immense risk. In 2023, only 88% of homeowners had any sort of homeowners insurance, with about half of uninsured homeowners earning less than $40,000 per year. When a natural disaster strikes, many uninsured homeowners rely on federal disaster recovery assistance to fund home repairs or rebuilds. Although federal programs are typically not designed as replacements for insurance, the breakdown of private insurance markets can transfer greater costs from uninsured, at-risk homeowners to all federal taxpayers, many of whom do pay for insurance or choose to live in areas with lower risks. To make matters worse, some insurance companies have announced they will be leaving certain markets because climate risks are too high to charge a price that consumers are willing to pay while still earning a profit. When insurance companies abandon a market, consumers&hellip;",

    "content": "A new national poll from BPC Action, in partnership with Pivotal Ventures and Morning Consult, shows that more than a quarter (26%) of registered voters juggle caregiving responsibilities. This poll aims to understand the impact of caregiving among those voters and gain broader insights into voter attitudes towards caregiving, regardless of whether they are current caregivers. This survey finds that caregiving demands have a profound and lasting impact on caregivers&#8217; lives and create a ripple effect on the U.S. economy. They often limit career options, reduce work capacity, and jeopardize financial security for caregivers. Alarmingly, nearly one in four (24%) caregivers who are not currently employed report being unable to enter or re-enter the workforce due to their caregiving responsibilities. The survey underscores a growing recognition among voters—caregivers or not—of the significant challenges posed by caregiving and demonstrates widespread support for policy solutions. Full Poll Results Key Findings 1. Caregiving responsibilities impact multiple age groups, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses. Age: Among caregivers, individuals ages 18-34 (32%) and ages 44-65 (31%) are the most likely to provide regular care to their family members. Ages 18-34: Primarily care for infant children (25%) and children aged 1-5 (67%) Ages 44-65: Primarily care for an older parent or elderly family member (56%) Ethnicity: White caregivers constitute the majority (65%) of caregivers among registered voters. Hispanic caregivers represent 16%. Black caregivers represent 12%. Asian/other caregivers represent 7%. Socioeconomic Status: Caregivers typically fall within lower wage brackets: 37% of caregivers earn below $50,000. 35% of caregivers earn between $50,000-$100,000. 28% of caregivers earn more than $100,000. 2. Caregiving demands impact caregivers&#8217; work, financial status, and education. Career impacts: More than half (52%) of caregivers report that those responsibilities have affected their careers, with 26% reporting a significant impact. 48% of caregivers have had to take unexpected time off work. 30% of caregivers have had to reduce their regularly scheduled work hours at least once a week in the past year due to caregiving responsibilities. 25% of caregivers have had to decline a promotion or new job opportunity. Financial strain: More than 2 in 3 (67%) caregivers report that caregiving has impacted their personal finances, with 31% stating it has had a significant impact. 37% have accrued credit card debt; 36% have been unable to save for emergencies; 34% have had to dip into retirement or savings accounts; 30% have been unable to save for retirement; and 22% have had to miss or be late or mortgage or rent payments. Educational setbacks: 1 in 3 (33%) of caregivers report that caregiving has impacted their education, with 17% stating it has had a significant impact. 22% of caregivers have had to delay higher education plans, with nearly 4 in 10 (38%) Gen Zer’s (1997-2012) and nearly 3 in 10 (29%) Millennials (1981-1996) reporting that caregiving demands have caused them to delay higher education plans. 17% of caregivers have been unable to go back to school due to their caregiving responsibilities, affecting 18-34 (26%) and 25-44 (22%) year olds the&hellip;",

    "content": "Combating fraud has long been a goal in unemployment insurance (UI) policy. However, the substantial amount of fraud during the pandemic—when bad actors exploited already overwhelmed state programs and expanded federal benefits, taking over $100 billion—led stakeholders at all levels of UI administration to sharpen their focus. With a broader UI modernization initiative underway, fraud may be viewed as a separate issue from, or even in tension with, promoting equitable access to UI benefits. Increased fraud-prevention measures may restrict access for eligible claimants, highlighting the challenge of balancing these two priorities. BPC’s recent engagement with several state UI directors and claimant advocates provides a crucial insight: these two goals are mutually reinforcing, vital components of a well-functioning UI system. Recognizing that combating fraud and promoting equitable access are complementary goals can help stakeholders approach choices and interventions holistically, advancing both more effectively for a stronger and more efficient system. UI Integrity: A Holistic View Enhancing UI integrity is more than just detecting and preventing fraud. It encompasses core principles of equitable access: ensuring that all eligible claimants, regardless of their background, have access to benefits and that all claims are processed in an impartial and timely manner. It also includes making the claims process easier to navigate and providing necessary services to claimants, such as assistance completing applications, language translation services, and access to information about their rights and available resources. Equity touches all aspects of a claimant’s experience with their state’s program. During the pandemic, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced up to $260 million for states to support initiatives promoting equitable access. States could use these funds for various purposes, including simplifying the language in documents shared with claimants, targeted outreach to underserved communities, reducing backlogs that delay timely payments, and improving customer service. Effective fraud prevention, however, is essential for maintaining equity. According to state UI directors, overwhelming levels of fraud during the pandemic diverted staff attention and resources away from service delivery and towards combatting fraud, limiting capacity to process claims and interact with claimants. Moreover, a focus on equity helps states combat fraud. BPC’s UI Tiger Teams report highlights the challenges and confusion about the claims process, particularly for non-English speakers, which can lead to errors that inadvertently raise suspicion of fraud. This also diverts attention away from service delivery towards fraud investigations, underscoring the mutually reinforcing relationship between fraud and equity. Removing Barriers with Effective Identity Proofing Methods When states implement effective identity proofing methods, it prevents fraud and removes barriers to equitable access. During the pandemic, identity theft—when individuals apply for unemployment benefits using someone else&#8217;s personal information—emerged as an additional barrier for eligible claimants.  The surge in pandemic identity theft fraud prompted states to strengthen their identity proofing methods—ensuring that the identity claimed by an individual applying for UI benefits truly belongs to them—to combat fraud. Many states have successfully reduced fraud by partnering with private vendors to develop digital identity-proofing tools using biometric data. For example, a Kentucky official shared that&hellip;",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has deemed CDR necessary to limit global warming to 1.5°C or less by 2100. On May 28, 2024, the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management announced Phase 1 awards for its pilot CDR procurement program directed by Congress in the FY23 Omnibus appropriations bill using funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Through federal purchases of CDR, the program aims to provide projects with a new revenue source and catalyze the CDR market as a whole. The 24 semifinalists receive $50,000 for Phase 1 and are eligible to compete for more support in Phase 2 and 3. The chosen projects span four technology pathways: direct air capture (DAC) with storage, biomass (BiCRS) technologies, enhanced geological weathering and enhanced mineralization technologies, and planned and managed carbon sinks. The program incorporates a number of considerations raised by a private workshop convened by the Bipartisan Policy Center in 2023, summarized in our previous blog Exploring Pathways for Government CDR Purchases. As seen in Figure 1, semifinalists are located across the U.S., with proposed delivery volumes (measured in CDR credits) ranging from 3,000 to 30,252 (each CDR credit represents one net metric ton of CO2 captured and stored). Figure 1. Semifinalists’ Locations Figure 2 depicts the total number of projects chosen from each of the four CDR pathways, with DAC securing the most awards. Figure 2. Number of Semifinalists Chosen by type of CDR  Figure 3 shows the size of the projects chosen in terms of the amount of CDR credits they will generate over the prize period sorted by type of CDR. This chart highlights that the BiCRS projects are expected to produce more CDR credits than all other types of projects combined over the prize period. Figure 3. Semifinalist Project Size by CDR Type Next Steps The 24 semifinalists can move forward to Phase 2. Teams will be required to further develop their CDR offtake agreement plans and submit a binding offer to DOE for the purchase of CDR, including a measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) plan. Winners of that round receive $375k and move on to Phase 3, in which teams will deliver verified CDR to DOE under agreed criteria and contract terms. CDR delivery will unlock a cash prize of up to $3 million per winner. The successful conclusion of CDR Purchase Pilot Program is an important step forward in the creation of a domestic CDR market and is likely to catalyze new private investment in the carbon removal sector.

    "content": "Key Takeaways Most respondents see the lack of affordable homes as a significant problem and believe homes will become even less affordable. 74% of respondents believe that the lack of affordable homes is a significant problem in the United States. This sentiment spans across demographics and political affiliation, with 83% of Democrats, 71% of independents, and 68% of Republicans acknowledging the severity of the issue. 65% of respondents reported that home prices in their community have become less affordable over the past year, and 52% expect this trend to continue. Over the last 12 months, 44% of renters reported increases in their monthly rent, and 26% of homeowners saw increases in their mortgage payments. Despite widespread confidence in being able to cover housing payments, many adults are just meeting their expenses, struggling to make ends meet, or falling behind on payments. 90% of homeowners and 78% of renters are confident they can pay their next mortgage or rent on time. However, 30% of adults reported just meeting their expenses, with 23% struggling to make ends meet. The situation is particularly dire for lower-income households, where 32% of those earning under $50,000 annually report having trouble meeting expenses, compared to 15% of those earning between $50,000 and $100,000, and only 7% of those making over $100,000. In the past year, nearly one-quarter of respondents (24%) have fallen behind on utility bills, and 17% have missed rent or mortgage payments. Nearly half of renters (49%) and 33% of homeowners had difficulty paying their rent or mortgage payments over the past 12 months. With high costs and fewer options, renters are now less likely to express interest in owning a home.  Only 47% of renters expressed a strong interest in owning a home one day, down 10% from BPC/Morning Consult polling from September 2022. High interest rates were cited as a major deterrent, with 60% of respondents indicating interest rates as a key factor preventing them from purchasing a home in the next 12 months. Most respondents reported higher perceived rates of homelessness in their communities compared to last year. 52% of respondents reported an increase in homelessness in their community over the past year, a 6% increase from a BPC/Morning Consult survey in May 2023. 24% of respondents reported a significant increase and 28% reported a slight increase. Urban respondents were more likely to notice an increase in homelessness in their community (62%) than suburban (51%) or rural (44%) respondents. Regionally, respondents from the West (62%) were the most likely to report an increase in homelessness, while respondents from the Midwest (44%) were the least likely to report an increase. Though many homeowner respondents experienced rising homeownership-related costs in the past year, most are still able to afford them. 40% of homeowner respondents reported experiencing an increase in the cost of their homeowners’ insurance or difficulty securing coverage in the past year. Yet only 29% of respondents said paying for their homeowners’ insurance was somewhat (22%) or very (7%) difficult. 56% of&hellip;",

    "content": "BPC’s latest research explores recent innovations at the local, state, and federal levels to improve public service delivery, and particularly awareness and take-up of tax credits such as the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. This blog highlights the important role that data sharing plays and offers best practices for program administration. What is Data Sharing? Data sharing is a formal process in which government agencies exchange records (typically through formal agreements) at a program or individual level to support specific activities. Data sharing within and across agencies is often used to achieve one or more of the following: Eligibility verification: To streamline eligibility processes, agencies request access to data to confirm or verify program eligibility and help qualified individuals receive benefits. For example, agreements between federal and state agencies allow the IRS to share relevant tax information to make state tax return verification simpler for state administrators. Back-end user integration: To improve accuracy and efficiency, some agencies have developed robust data systems that work across programs to optimize service delivery. For example, the Administration for Children and Families’ (ACF) Interoperability Initiative allows agency staff to enter and search for relevant data across programs to inform decisions for clients. Front-end user experience: To improve customer service, some agencies have developed online platforms that streamline the application process for beneficiaries, allowing them to enter data once to confirm their eligibility for multiple programs. One example of an integrated system is the Georgia Gateway, which simplifies the front-end user experience while collecting consistent data that can inform agency decisions. Legal Constraints Governing Data Sharing Several statutes regulate the sharing of individual data within the federal government. The Privacy Act of 1974 governs how most agencies collect, maintain, and disseminate personally identifiable data in a system of records. Certain types of federal data are governed by additional laws and regulations, however, these statutes often make a distinction between interagency sharing of aggregated statistical data and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Health information must follow regulations set by the Health Insurance and Portability Act (HIPPA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), student data is governed by Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and consumers’ personal financial information is protected by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, to name a few. Other laws, including the E-Government Act of 2002 and Paperwork Reduction Act broadly impact agencies that collect and store information from the public. In addition, agencies often find themselves navigating specific regulations unique to each program. The U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs provides assistance to agencies seeking to comply with privacy policies. When it comes to tax programs, the IRS faces strict data sharing regulations, which are detailed in IRC section 6103(d). While the IRS may disclose federal tax information to state and local tax authorities for tax administration purposes, they are prohibited from sharing data with non-tax agencies without legislative authorization or extreme circumstances.

    "content": "Survey after survey show that Americans feel poorly prepared for retirement. A new national poll from Public First, commissioned by BPC’s American Savings Education Council (ASEC), sheds new light on a potential cause of that uncertainty: a striking mismatch between the income sources workers expect to rely on in retirement and the sources of income current retirees report. The largest discrepancy was related to the role of Social Security. Though only half (49%) of non-retired respondents expect Social Security to be a major source of their income, 82% of retired respondents report that Social Security does make up a major source of income—more than twice as many as report relying on any other source. Even among the non-retirees who are closest to traditional retirement ages (those aged 55–64), just 71% report expecting Social Security to make up a major source of retirement income; for those furthest from retirement (aged 18–24), that drops to 33%. Lack of awareness of how Social Security benefits work or concerns that the program will not be fully funded when younger generations retire may drive some of this effect. Without action from Congress, the primary Social Security trust fund is set to be depleted by 2033 but that does not mean the program will become defunct or bankrupt. Rather, without congressional action, all beneficiaries will face an immediate benefit cut of approximately 20%. Even in that worst-case scenario, today’s workers will still receive around 80% of their projected benefits when they retire—a major source of income for all but the wealthiest retirees. In place of Social Security, non-retired respondents expect their own savings and continued labor income to play much greater roles in retirement than is likely realistic. For starters, as shown in Figure 1, there is a significant disparity between the expectations of today’s workers and the reality for current retirees. In addition, far more non-retired respondents expect retirement savings to be a major source of retirement income than are actively contributing to 401(k)s, IRAs, and the like. While nearly half (48%) of non-retirees anticipate these accounts will be a major income source, only 36% report actively contributing. The biggest expectations mismatch, in percentage terms, is related to earnings from work in retirement. Nineteen percent of non-retired respondents expect earnings from part-time work to provide significant income in retirement, but only 7% of retired respondents report such earnings. It could be the case that older Americans encounter insurmountable obstacles to working, such as reduced physical abilities or labor market practices that are unfriendly to older workers. It could also be the case that many workers reach retirement without the need to rely on labor earnings. Our survey provides some support for a more optimistic interpretation—43% of retirees are surprised by how much they enjoy retirement. The State of Retirement Readiness Our survey suggests that more than half of Americans lack confidence in their ability to retire when they want to and sustain a comfortable life, as shown in Figure 2.

    "content": "This week marked a major milestone in artificial intelligence (AI) governance with the launch of the Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI (ARIA) program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). With a focus on assessing the societal risks and impacts of AI systems, this program underscores NIST’s commitment to advancing AI that is reliable, safe, transparent, explainable, privacy-enhanced, and fair. The Bipartisan Policy Center has long recognized that addressing AI’s impacts requires more than technical solutions and advocated for funding to develop technical and non-technical solutions that ensure human values are at the center of AI governance frameworks. The use of AI could profoundly reshape our society and economy. Numerous real-world examples have already demonstrated the positive impacts AI can have, from improving business operations to securing reliable crop yields for farmers. These examples highlight the potential of AI to drive efficiency and innovation and solve complex problems across various sectors. Yet along with these advantages, AI also carries significant risks. Not all AI applications have positive impacts; for instance, algorithms designed to keep our youth online longer irrespective of impacts to their social lives. Additionally, predictive tools used in high-stakes decision-making processes have been observed to reflect human biases, prompting ethical concerns about fairness and accountability. Robust safeguards and standards can help developers and deployers of AI tools navigate the multifaceted risks inherent at every stage of AI design, development, and deployment. By incorporating the perspectives of a diverse community of users and advocates, these measures can more accurately reflect the real-world implications of the technology. This approach not only helps in managing potential harms but also elevates our benchmarks for achieving positive outcomes. For the U.S. to lead the world in AI, policymakers must consider factors affecting both daily life and long-term impacts. To understand how human behavior and social norms influence AI’s development and how AI in turn affects humans, we must identify the sociotechnical factors influencing AI at every stage of its lifecycle and the real-world impacts and consequences it might have. Social vs Technical Definitions AI, like many technologies, is developed by humans using technical rules and methodologies and deployed into our lived environments, where it then weaves itself into our social dynamics. Sociotechnical considerations underlie many technological developments, particularly those as broad as AI. Therefore, we can draw insights from historical innovations as to how we manage societal risks and rewards. Research by TRAILS (the NIST-NSF Institute for Trustworthy AI in Law and Society), in collaboration with research institutions and industry, documented numerous historical precedents demonstrating that sociotechnical factors are a crucial consideration for innovation and the successful widespread integration of new technologies. For instance, given the broad implications biomedical devices can have in contexts beyond clinical care, sociotechnical considerations were critical to ensure that devices like artificial joint replacements and pacemakers received rigorous testing and monitoring so people could use them effectively in daily life. Similarly, sociotechnical considerations in geological engineering help better account for the environmental impacts and consequences&hellip;",

    "content": "If you haven’t figured out what to make of artificial intelligence (AI), you are not alone. AI has advanced rapidly in recent years and is quickly becoming a fundamental technology upon which our world operates and interacts. But people tend to fear what they do not understand, and data suggests that a growing share of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI. Thus, there is a growing need to equip the public with the skills to recognize AI applications and responsibly utilize AI in their daily lives. Public trust is essential for the effective integration of AI into society, and trust can be built through transparency, accountability, and a shared understanding of AI fundamentals. The Bipartisan Policy Center is dedicated to contributing resources and scaling ongoing efforts to educate policymakers and the public on the basics of AI. This blog explores the various benefits of widespread AI literacy and outlines strategies to enhance public understanding of AI. Watch our explainer video here. Principles of AI Literacy AI literacy is the ability to recognize, use, and evaluate AI technologies. It involves knowing what AI can and can’t do, how it works, and its risks and benefits. AI literacy helps us understand fundamental questions like: What is AI? While there is no consensus on a single definition of AI, understanding basic terminology, concepts, and applications can help develop shared understanding and unravel common AI misconceptions. For example, key AI terminology includes data, algorithms, and machine learning. Where is it? It is important to recognize real-world applications of AI in daily life. You might interact with an AI system on your digital device, on the internet, in the workplace, or out in public. How does it work? AI systems require human input to reach decisions. Knowing how to use an AI product safely will ensure that the AI system serves its intended purpose effectively and responsibly. Who does it impact? Given the deep interconnection between technology and society, AI has the potential to affect people from all walks of life and impact every sector of the economy. Decisionmakers must think critically about the ethical implications of AI applications, specifically those that impact public health, privacy, and safety. Goals of AI Literacy AI literacy is important for multiple reasons: Enhances trust and safety: AI literacy empowers users by placing them in the driver’s seat when it comes to using AI devices and managing their relationship with the technology. Misunderstanding and mistrust serve as key barriers to AI adoption, but the ability to live, learn, and work harmoniously with AI helps remedy fear of the unknown. AI-literate consumers are more likely to be risk-aware, which ensures that AI systems perform safely and as intended. Promotes oversight and accountability: Learning about AI encourages society to participate in critical conversations around AI governance, including the policies, guidelines, and regulations that manage risks and maximize the benefits of AI.

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center applauds Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Mike Rounds, Martin Heinrich, and Todd Young for their thoughtful bipartisan leadership in crafting their &#8220;Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Policy in the U.S. Senate.” BPC recognizes the profound implications—both positive and potentially negative—this swiftly advancing technology holds for our society and economy. The working group’s Roadmap carefully balanced these potential outcomes, ensuring the United States remains the clear leader in AI development and deployment. AI in Government We agree that the federal government should focus on getting its data ready for AI use and have advocated for this initiative to spur innovation and access to data. Government initiatives should focus on creating an all-of-government “AI-ready data” infrastructure, ensuring that data is accessible and usable for AI applications. Moreover, directing research priorities towards responsible innovation in fundamental and applied sciences—such as biotechnology, advanced computing, robotics, and materials science—along with trustworthy AI topics like transparency, explainability, privacy, interoperability, and security will foster a robust and ethical AI ecosystem. The importance of funding the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) efforts for this roadmap to be effective cannot be overstated. We are heartened by the funding language that acknowledges the necessary resources to realize the promise of responsible AI. As appropriations are considered, it is crucial to recognize that funding for AI should be separate from general funding for IT in the federal government. This distinction ensures that the work to modernize federal IT from a cybersecurity perspective remains a fundamental and separate focus from AI modernization. Recruiting, retraining, and retaining an AI-ready workforce are priorities we are pleased to see included in this roadmap. Utilizing the US Digital Service, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, and the Presidential Management Fellows is a great start. Focusing on bringing talent to the federal workforce should continue to be a priority. We encourage other mechanisms to be considered, such as an AmeriCorps focus on AI-Literacy, a program to detail AI proficient employees to agencies standing up AI programs, and an expansion of the statistical agencies’ workforce who are already equipped to endeavor on data-heavy research projects. Finally, we appreciate the roadmap’s callout for a comprehensive data privacy law. Data privacy has been an outstanding concern for legislators and constituents for years. AI is only going to scale up those concerns and considerations. Unless we address the policy issues in the technology stack that enables AI, we will always have unanswered questions and liability in future system deployment. A federal data privacy law must be established to alleviate many privacy questions as AI systems are deployed. Integration of AI in Health Care We agree that prioritizing patient needs is crucial when incorporating AI into health care. Legislation supporting the integration of AI in health care must include guardrails to protect patients and ensure the use of accurate data. We support the roadmap’s call for strong data management, recognizing the importance of accurate and diverse data as well as patient privacy protection in AI development. While&hellip;",

Hailing from politically and geographically distinct backgrounds, Representatives Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) and Jill Tokuda (D-HI) joined BPC’s American Congressional Exchange (ACE) for back-to-back visits to each other’s districts to learn from ongoing recovery efforts in the wake of destructive wildfires and spur hope for the future as they help their communities rebuild. Six years ago, the Camp Fire ravaged the town of Paradise and surrounding communities in northern California’s Sierra Nevada foothills. The fire destroyed over 18,000 structures in the small town and was the deadliest wildfire of the last century until August 2023, when wildfire claimed over 100 lives and ravaged the historic town of Lāhainā in Maui, Hawai’i. Rep. LaMalfa, who represents Paradise and surrounding communities impacted by the Camp Fire, understood the challenges ahead for Lāhainā and reached out to Rep. Tokuda to offer his support in the aftermath of the disaster. The congresswoman welcomed the opportunity to meet with local, county, and federal officials in Paradise to learn about their ongoing recovery. There, local leaders outlined best practices for federal policymakers to support affected communities after a traumatic disaster. A tour brought Reps. Tokuda and LaMalfa to the community’s new high school, showcased newly constructed affordable housing, and included discussions with US Forest Service agents on sustainable forestry practices. Rebuilding vital infrastructure is an urgent challenge for communities recovering from disaster, and Rep. Tokuda was particularly eager to emulate the efforts of the Paradise Building Resiliency Center, established in the wake of the Camp Fire as a “one-stop shop” to expedite the permitting and approval process for the construction of housing and other basic infrastructure. ACE then headed to Maui, where Rep. Tokuda shared her learnings from Paradise with Maui Mayor Richard Bissen and his local Advisory Council, which interfaces with the community to ensure recovery efforts are grounded in the needs and realities of residents who were directly affected by the wildfires. The representatives then joined federal, state, and local officials for a survey of the Lāhainā burn zone, where they were briefed on the clean-up operation and options for rebuilding. While much has been done to clear the area since August, the scale of devastation remains stunning, and recovery and rebuilding efforts will persist for years to come. The members of Congress found it particularly impactful to hear from the local community about their wishes for a reconstructed Lāhainā that incorporates native Hawai’ian culture and tradition. Perhaps most significantly, witnessing the progress made in rebuilding Paradise gave both lawmakers hope for a prosperous future in Lāhainā. “There is a definite comfort knowing that, while the road ahead for our communities is long, we aren&#8217;t on it alone,” Representative Tokuda said in a speech on the House floor following the trip. “I&#8217;m honored to have a trusted partner and friend in Congressman LaMalfa, and I look forward to the work we will do together.” Fortunately, tragedy is not the only common denominator between the two lawmakers.

    "content": "The future of artificial intelligence in health care must be grounded in transparency and trust, experts from across the health care sector and the political spectrum emphasized in an April meeting conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Center, in partnership with the Commonwealth Fund. Key takeaways addressed reimagining regulation, establishing transparency and trust, navigating liability, and understanding the current landscape. AI transparency involves providing insights into the development, training, operation, and deployment of an AI system. In the context of health care, transparency becomes crucial as it enables patients and providers to gain a deeper understanding of the data sets utilized by AI algorithms, how algorithms are created, and how they interpret data. Reimagining Regulation The conversation centered on how traditional regulatory frameworks are struggling to keep pace with the ever-evolving nature of AI. In contrast to static products such as pills or devices, AI exhibits dynamic evolution, learning, and adaptability. The transition from machine learning and AI, upon which current FDA approvals are based, to generative AI introduces challenges for regulation. Our current regulatory processes resemble navigating with a paper map in a world equipped with GPS technology—outdated and inadequate for the dynamic nature of AI. Updating our regulatory infrastructure requires agencies to adopt a new approach to AI regulation. Attendees proposed approaches such as reoccurring approval points or professional licensing exams (mirroring the ongoing standards expected of human professionals). Additionally, participants discussed the notion of third-party audits as a possible pathway toward comprehensive oversight. Others highlighted the need for clear definitions on key terms including risk, bias, and harm in the efforts to guide effective regulation. Participants also observed that the Supreme Court is currently considering a decision on the use of Chevron deference in regulatory review. Currently, the Supreme Court has ruled that the interpretation of ambiguous statutes is entrusted to administrative agencies. Should this ruling be overturned or modified, it would have broader implications for AI health care regulatory efforts. Establishing Transparency and Trust Participants engaged in a vibrant discussion on transparency and trust in AI algorithms. Some underscored the significance of comprehending how algorithms make decisions so that users can better understand their capabilities and limitations. Others argued that outcomes and performance play a more significant role in gaining public and professional confidence in AI. Simplifying AI to provide explainability may compromise its overall capability. Several participants discussed the importance of building trust within historically marginalized communities, noting they may harbor more mistrust toward AI systems. They emphasized that when making decisions about AI deployment, it&#8217;s vital to engage in tailored communication with these communities. That could include involving marginalized communities in the decision-making process and being transparent about how an algorithm formulates a decision. Navigating Liability The conversation delved into the complex realm of liability and accountability associated with AI deployment in health care settings. As AI algorithms could potentially guide diagnostic and treatment decisions, the allocation of responsibility is up for consideration. Participants grappled with pertinent questions: Who bears liability when AI falters in&hellip;",

    "content": "New clean energy is coming online faster than ever, but near-term electricity load growth forecasts are increasing to levels not seen in over a decade, driven largely by new data centers and factories. New construction is good for economic development but can be complicated for electric utilities, regulators, grid planners, and operators. Three key issues underlie concerns about whether the U.S. electric sector is doing enough to ensure grid reliability (so customers have electricity when they need it) and grid resilience (bouncing back quickly after power supply disruptions). Issue 1: An Evolving Electricity Mix and Rising Electricity Demand The U.S. power system is grappling with historic changes to its mix of electricity generation resources (Fig. 1). Coal capacity has fallen to an all time low of 16-18%, while natural gas has grown to the largest generation source at about 40%. Renewable energy from wind, hydropower, solar, biomass, and geothermal resources now provides nearly 23% of national electricity generation, surpassing coal for the first time in history in 2022. Nuclear remains steady at about 20%, but many existing reactors are aging and face an uncertain economic future without additional investment and policy support. If nuclear is to remain an integral part of the U.S. electricity generation mix, a new wave of nuclear energy power plants will need to come to fruition. Figure 1. U.S. Electricity Generation by Source Source: Data from EIA’s Monthly Energy Review The retirement of coal plants and potentially older nuclear power plants is contributing to the shifting energy landscape, creating a significant need for new “firm” generation capacity, meaning power that is available 24/7 and can be dispatched by grid operators at any time. Energy efficiency measures and clean, firm power sources—those without carbon emissions and not dependent on weather conditions—are critical to balance the variability that comes with wind and solar resources. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation&#8217;s (NERC) latest Long-Term Reliability Assessment forecasts a capacity deficit over the next decade, with generator retirements outpacing available replacement resources. NERC estimates that while power generation will grow by 4% through 2032, electricity demand, or load, will grow by 10%. Other studies warn that recent projections are likely underestimating load growth from new manufacturing facilities and data centers and have not accounted for the growing use of artificial intelligence. Utilities, power companies, and grid planners are struggling with how to rapidly bring new generation online as retiring power plants roll off the system and new demand for electricity surges. Issue 2: Aging and Increasingly Unreliable Grid Infrastructure The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) reports that in 2021, U.S. electricity customers experienced roughly 7 hours of power outages, approximately double the amount of time recorded in 2013.

    "content": "BPC’s health team traveled through America’s heartland to explore the health care landscape, finding both innovative programs in rural communities and significant challenges that Washington should address. Here are the team’s main takeaways on three important health care topics: mental health and substance use, rural hospitals, and digital and telehealth technologies Our Trip BPCs’ health team spent three days traveling to 20 locations across Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Splitting into specialized groups, we explored rural hospitals, digital health initiatives, and behavioral health services. Behavioral Health BPC visited five locations that deliver crisis care to patients experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis. These services provide patients with a safe place to receive assessment, observation, and short-term treatment and give the community crisis options other than inpatient psychiatric care, emergency rooms, and incarceration. BPC also met with two school-based programs that cover a range of prevention, early detection, and treatment services for youth experiencing mental health and substance use risks and issues. Staff from Sen. Tina Smith&#8217;s (D-MN) office joined BPC for several site visits. Sen Smith serves on BPC’s Youth Mental Health and Substance Use Task Force Honorary Congressional Working Group. Rural Hospitals BPC met with a variety of hospitals, one of which recently switched to a Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) designation and others who considered REH but chose against it. REH is a hospital that provides emergency care and outpatient services but can no longer support inpatient services due to small volumes or costs. In addition, we met with two Sole Community Hospitals to discuss ongoing challenges with payment structures, transferring patients, and workforce issues. A Sole Community Hospital is a designation given to hospitals that are the primary source of inpatient care for a large geographic area, typically rural or underserved regions. Digital BPC’s digital health team toured multiple facilities to see how rural hospitals are connecting patients to care through high-quality virtual services. The facilities included two tele-emergency departments that connected patients directly with providers in other parts of the state to triage patients as they needed care. We also met with the team running a Project ECHO based in Sioux Falls to learn how the project creates educational hubs to train providers in rural communities and increase health care access. What’s Working 1. Rural Resilience At the forefront was the resilience of rural hospitals, operating at maximum capacity while striving to meet the diverse health care needs of their communities. The team received direct accounts about the pivotal role of designations like Critical Access Hospital and the emergence of the Rural Emergency Hospital model, providing a lifeline for struggling institutions. 2. Innovative Collaborations Amid the challenges, innovative collaborations have emerged. Rural hospitals have forged partnerships with neighboring facilities and virtual care providers, extending their reach and enhancing service capabilities. Whenever possible, hospitals are successfully partnering with other providers to ensure smooth transitions from hospitals to other types of more appropriate care, particularly for individuals in mental health crisis. Multisector partnerships and school-based programs were&hellip;",

    "content": "Kinship caregiving – situations when relatives care for a child when a parent is unable to – is a longstanding practice, including in child welfare where relatives care for children both inside and outside of the child welfare system. About a third of all children in foster care – nearly 130,000 &#8212; are in kinship placements. And, it is estimated that up to 300,000 children are being cared for by relatives as a way to avoid foster care.. Kinship caregiving has bipartisan support and is widely considered to be best practice as it nurtures a child’s familial bonds, promotes cultural connections, and provides stability for children. However, there are differing perspectives on key kinship policy decision points making it a complex area of child welfare policymaking. Earlier this month BPC hosted an online discussion to examine complexities in kinship care and learn about recent state policy efforts on kinship caregiving to avoid foster care. Six important takeaways 1) Advocates use different terminology to describe the practice of relatives caring for children to avoid foster care; choice of language often reflects one’s perspective. While kinship caregiving is viewed favorably by policymakers and the public, there is considerable debate within the field over how child welfare agencies should make kinship arrangements for children as a way to avoid having children enter foster care. The debate is not defined by political affiliation but rather reflects an array of differing philosophies, values and perspectives. The practice of kinship caregiving to avoid foster care is called many different things, including kinship diversion, hidden foster care, safety planning with kin, and shadow foster care. 2) Crafting effective, balanced and fair policies requires thoughtful attention. Developing policies to support kinship caregiving to avoid foster care is challenging. Webinar guests discussed ensuring: children need to be separated from parents and could not be safely maintained with their parents with supports provided; kin caregivers can safely care for children and can meet their needs; there is transparency and due process, that parents and kin caregivers know their options and rights; roles and responsibilities of different actors are clearly articulated; and consistency and equity in agency practice. 3) While considered best practice, kinship caregiving is also a work in progress. A confluence of factors is driving policymakers’ attention to kinship caregiving. The new final regulations on kinship licensing provides new flexibility and opportunity for state and local agencies to engage and support kinship caregivers. In addition, the body of knowledge about the benefits to children’s health and development associated with kinship connections continues to grow. Many state policy and program leaders are striving to deepen support for kinship caregiving by implementing new policies, programs and practices. A new series of reports by the Annie E Casey Foundation is documenting this movement. Several states have enacted legislation to address the needs of kinship caregivers who are stepping up to care for children so foster care can be avoided so far this year. Virginia is one of the states enacting reform this&hellip;",

    "content": "Fifteen of our nation’s top child welfare experts formed a new work group focused on improving policies that govern child welfare financing and accountability. The work group is one of a series of efforts led by BPC’s Child Welfare Initiative and launched its first meeting this month. Over the next year, the work group will examine existing financing streams and performance measures, study prior reform efforts, analyze data, and hear from families and others with unique expertise. Following a months-long discovery phase, the experts will develop actionable recommendations that policymakers can use to spark innovation, improve accountability, and drive better outcomes for children, youth, and families. The passage of the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA) more than six years ago marked a pivotal shift in federal child welfare policy. By providing dedicated federal funding for prevention efforts, this legislation signaled a paradigm shift aimed at supporting and strengthening families earlier, so that more children could safely avoid the need for foster care. The legislation also attempted to minimize inappropriate residential placements for children and youth and strengthen family-based foster care. BPC’s extensive landscape analysis conducted last year identified an overwhelming level of support among child welfare stakeholders for the vision of FFPSA, yet they expressed a high level of frustration with implementation thus far. There is a strong bipartisan appetite in continuing financing reform efforts that: increase flexibility and access to funding to respond to local needs while incentivizing best practice, improve system accountability for outcomes of child safety and family strengthening, rather than just process measures, are responsive to changing levels of need, and are administratively efficient including determining eligibility for and obtaining federal funding. The work group has a timely opportunity to develop recommendations that can shape the future of child welfare financing and accountability.

    "content": "Much about the landscape of the American elections workforce is poorly understood, especially those roles beyond the chief officials in the over 10,000 local election jurisdictions across the country. Information about chief local election officials (LEOs) is regularly collected as part of the Elections and Voting Information Center (EVIC) LEO survey, but there are few comprehensive data sources about the non-chief, rank-and-file election staff who likely constitute the majority of the election administrator workforce. A new dataset compiled by BPC sheds light on the job market for election administrators, including non-chief election staff. Our dataset compiles the job postings for election administrators that have been posted publicly on the Electionline Weekly site each week since 2011. Electionline is a popular newsletter and hub for the elections community, aggregating election-related headlines, jobs, and resources on a daily and weekly basis. Access the dataset directly: View in Google Sheets &gt;  Download the CSV from Github &gt; &nbsp; For the benefit of any researchers interested in analyzing this dataset, we use OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 to process the dataset, extracting information on compensation and determining which jobs belong to chief election officials. (As of this writing, the dataset is updated automatically each week, the day after an edition of Electionline Weekly is issued.) This project, along with the work underway by BPC&#8217;s Election Workforce Advisory Council, reflects BPC’s commitment to researching, enhancing, and innovating election administration recruitment, retention, and training. Election staff salaries have been flat for years As an example of how the dataset can be used, we analyzed the salaries included in these job descriptions. We find that the mean of the posted salary ranges for election staff has increased only by about 10% in the last 10 years, from about $65,000 to about $71,000. The numbers above each point indicate how many job descriptions are included in that point. There are too few posted job descriptions for chief officials to enable us to draw strong conclusions, but EVIC data also suggests that salaries for chief officials have been level since at least 2019. Staff in larger jurisdictions command higher salaries EVIC data also suggests that the key driver of chief official salaries is the size of the jurisdiction. Larger jurisdictions have more funding and their chief officials manage more staff, so it’s unsurprising that those chief officials would be better compensated. With the Electionline data, we are able to show that the same trend appears to hold for their staff. According to these postings, a staff member in a jurisdiction with 2.5 million voters is likely to make about $100,000, while a staff member in a jurisdiction with 100,000 voters is likely to make about $66,000. Caveats There are some caveats that should be considered when analyzing and interpreting this dataset. First, there is no reason to believe that our dataset is a representative sample of all jobs in the workforce; only 40 states have posted jobs on Electionline, and some of those states post much more frequently than others.

Plus, new legislative and executive actions that threaten to chill campus speech. Campus Happenings The Growing Pro-Palestinian Protest Movement, Visualized Max Rust, Dan Frosch, Valerie Bauerlein, and Taylor Umlauf | The Wall Street Journal | April 24, 2024 Pro-Palestine protests have spread across college and university campuses in recent weeks. Hundreds of arrests have already been made as administrators attempt to strike a balance between free speech and campus safety. Protest organizers and law enforcement officials are preparing for continued protests throughout the summer, including at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Activist Groups Trained Students for Months before Campus Protests Tawnell D. Hobbs, Valerie Bauerlein, and Dan Frosch | The Wall Street Journal | May 3, 2024 Campus protestors across the country have received training and support from “longtime activists and left-wing groups.” Student organizers at Columbia University consulted groups including the National Students for Justice in Palestine and former Black Panthers in the months leading up to the demonstrations. A Chaotic Night at U.C.L.A. Raises Questions about Police Response Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Mike Baker, and Serge F. Kovaleski |The New York Times | May 12, 2024 As colleges and universities around the country have called on law enforcement to contain protests or clear encampments, some institutions have come under scrutiny for alleged failure of police to deal with violent protests and counterprotests. The University of California, Los Angeles has hired an independent consultant to investigate the slow response to an attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment on April 30. State and Federal Columbia University President Takes Heat at Congressional Antisemitism Hearing Gabriella Borter | Reuters | April 17, 2024 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik testified on antisemitism on campus before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce. Republican committee members accused Columbia of failing to protect Jewish students, while President Shafik denounced antisemitic behavior by students and faculty. Campus Free Speech Is Getting Murky for Republican Governors Juan Perez Jr. | Politico | April 27, 2024 Pro-Palestine protests on campuses in Republican states are challenging free speech protections set by Republican governors in recent years.

    "content": "“Just do your job.” That’s what Representative Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) told an audience at the Hinckley Institute for Politics when asked how members of Congress can work past all the vitriol and derisive language. Congressman Blake Moore (R-UT), the colleague he was visiting in Utah’s northwest, agreed. Those four words could have been the theme for the entire American Congressional Exchange (ACE) trip. Rep. Moore’s district, which sits on the edge of the Great Salt Lake, stands in stark contrast to Rep. Panetta’s district along the central California coast where the two kicked off their exchange last July. Despite their distinct backgrounds, they forged a relationship over numerous shared priorities and a desire to get things done in Washington. Namely, both are members of the powerful House Committee on Ways and Means and previously sat together on the Committee on Armed Services, where Rep. Panetta continues to serve. The trip’s stops addressed several issues currently up for debate in Congress, such as increasing America’s global competitiveness, addressing the dysfunctional budget process, bolstering our national defense, and ensuring resources for servicemembers. Additionally, Rep. Panetta became the first member of Congress to complete two separate ACE trips, having previously swapped visits with Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY). The day began with a visit to Welfare Square’s facilities in downtown Salt Lake City. Operated by the Church of Latter-day Saints, its volunteers provide food, clothing, and other resources free of charge to those in need. The center also provides regular training for community members—most of whom are immigrants or refugees—to prepare them for the workforce and equip them with tools for self-reliance. Rep. Panetta saw firsthand how these volunteer and faith-based entities act as an important social safety net for the local community. Next, the congressmen visited Hill Air Force Base in nearby Ogden, Utah. Rep. Moore underscored the local and national significance of the base, which employs more than 23,000 military, civilian, and contractor personnel and is the second-largest Air Force base in terms of population and footprint. The Air Base serves as the key support, logistics, maintenance, and overhaul center for fifth-generation aircraft including the F-35, F-22, and F-16 programs. A stop at ES3 Material Research and Development Center, which fabricates critical components for the aerospace sector, further underscored the importance of the region’s industries for our national defense. Though Rep. Moore no longer serves on the Armed Services Committee, Rep. Panetta highlighted how the trusted relationship the congressmen forged through their ACE visits has enabled him to vouch for his colleague from across the aisle and ensure his concerns are heard. Next, the congressmen joined Rep. Moore’s Debt and Deficit Task Force, a group of business and civic leaders from across the state, for a working lunch discussion on debt and deficit reduction. Both congressmen support the establishment of a bipartisan, bicameral fiscal commission in Congress to reign in the mounting national debt.

    "content": "Small businesses employ nearly half the private sector workforce and generate trillions of dollars of economic activity. AI adoption and integration can help small businesses compete against larger firms by streamlining operations and reducing costs. Entrepreneurs and small businesses are also harnessing AI to drive growth and gain competitive advantages. Through the integration of digital tools that implement AI technologies, ranging from generative AI-powered chatbots to machine learning commerce platforms, they are revolutionizing their operations. BPC’s latest report highlights how small businesses are implementing AI-driven solutions for accounting, marketing, customer relations, and more. Over 80% of small business owners who use AI realized its value in their operations: improving systems, increasing efficiencies, focusing time, and producing valuable content. Still, only a narrow set of businesses today leverage AI. Lawmakers must ensure AI policy promotes inclusion and innovation so more small businesses can take advantage and move our economy forward. Starting and Growing a Business AI tools can help small businesses gain several advantages. Using AI-enabled tools, businesses can analyze market trends faster and at a larger scale to enhance decision making processes in early stages, concept testing phases, and foster valuable feedback loops. Similarly, machine learning algorithms can analyze increasing volumes of customer data, leading to improved products or services that may better attract customers or appeal to a broader customer base. These AI tools continuously evolve, leveraging the data they process to create an iterative cycle of improvements, thus enhancing customer offerings and experiences as more businesses adopt these tools. Marketing strategies are another example of how AI can help across stages of the business life cycle: Initially, businesses can employ AI tools to create targeted campaigns, segmenting audiences, and predicting audience behavior to best understand how to grow their customer base. As small businesses grow, AI tools can offer cost-effective solutions that drive savings and improve profitability. AI tools can include things like chatbots, cloud services platforms, scheduling assistants, digital assistants, and typing/writing applications; more commonly for small businesses, this includes e-commerce platforms. Later in the business life cycle, AI can target market demographics and behaviors of a business’ current customer base. By doing this, businesses gain the ability to tailor their product design, refine brand messaging, and optimize market strategies. AI can also help small businesses make more informed strategic decisions. Using AI-powered data analytics, businesses can extract deeper insights from larger datasets revealing patterns that may not be easily discernable using traditional methods. These insights are important for developing a strong business model and making key decisions related to pricing, product features, and customer service strategies. While AI offers many opportunities for small business growth, it also introduces challenges. “Hallucinations,” where AI presents convincing, yet inaccurate information is one. Small business owners should integrate their own expertise, intuition, and insights when analyzing AI-derived outputs. Keeping up with the digital skills required to effectively use and manage AI technologies is also a challenge. Investments in AI literacy, upskilling, and reskilling can help.

    "content": "The 2024 report of the trustees of the Social Security trust funds underscores the precarity of the nation’s most effective and most popular federal program. Unless Congress acts, Social Security’s primary trust fund will be depleted in 2033. When that happens, each and every beneficiary will see their benefit cut immediately by 21%.  Figure 1: Social Security Benefit Cliff Projected in 2033 Policymakers have known for decades that Social Security’s finances are unsustainable but have consistently failed to act, leaving the program an estimated $23 trillion short over the next 75 years—a gap between projected inflows and benefit payments that continues to grow. This inaction threatens the retirement security of millions of Americans who rely on Social Security payments, not to mention millions more planning for retirement.  Strengthening Social Security’s finances is far from impossible; rather, it’s a policy choice that requires political courage. Congress last reformed the program—addressing its then-looming insolvency in the process—more than 40 years ago; prior to that, lawmakers regularly updated the program’s tax rates, tax base, benefit amounts, and other policy parameters. Instead of leaving on autopilot the most effective anti-poverty program in U.S. history, Congress must return to more active stewardship of Social Security and take steps to address the impact of rapidly changing national demographics.  A Program Designed for the Past Social Security benefits are funded by payroll tax revenues in addition to the trust fund reserves that were built up over many years of annual surpluses. (The program is now expected to run deficits permanently.) But the aging U.S. population has placed an unprecedented burden on a workforce that hasn’t kept up in size. In 1960, there were more than five workers paying Social Security taxes per beneficiary, but that ratio has dropped to just three-to-one in 2023 and is projected to decline to less than 2.5-to-one by the middle of the century. One major reason: the beginning of “Peak 65,” the period from 2024 to 2027 in which more than 4.1 million Americans will turn 65 each year, the largest surge of retirements in our nation’s history.  Figure 2: The Long Decline of the Worker-to-Beneficiary Ratio This many Americans entering retirement is only part of the problem. Compounding the stress on Social Security’s finances is how long those retirees are living. The life expectancy of a 65-year-old has increased by 50% since 1940 (shortly after Social Security was created), and SSA projects that trend will continue unabated. With record numbers of Americans spending record lengths of time in retirement—and population growth failing to keep up—Social Security can no longer sustain itself using policy parameters set decades in the past.  Figure 3: Americans Keep Living Longer For example, when Congress last reformed Social Security in 1983, 90% of all earnings covered by the program were subject to the payroll taxes used to finance benefits. Now, the tax base is only 82% of covered earnings, as Americans earning more than the taxable maximum have seen their incomes increase much faster than those earning less.&hellip;",

    "content": "A brief history lesson: in the 1600s, the rising demand for access to scientific knowledge led to the development of scientific journals. Fast-forward, similar practices arose in the 1970s around open-source and free software movements when computer programmers pushed for open access to research and decentralized innovation, which would allow anyone to contribute to the development of science and technology. Recently, AI breakthroughs have raised new questions around the open versus closed technology debate. However, defining openness in AI is not easy for two reasons. First, today&#8217;s AI industry lacks consensus on what &#8220;openness&#8221; means, and second, it is not a set concept; openness is instead considered a spectrum. To help alleviate these concerns, this piece will explain the fundamentals of these concepts and the current debates around them. The Openness in AI Spectrum To understand what “open AI” is, it is helpful to review its intention first. “Openness” seeks to advance the development of AI through stakeholder collaboration. There are three key stakeholders in AI development: developers, deployers, and users. Developers grant a certain level of access to other stakeholders when releasing their AI systems. A fully closed AI system is only accessible to a particular group. It could be an AI developer company or a specific group within it, mainly for internal research and development purposes. On the other hand, more open systems may allow public access or make available certain parts, such as data, code, or model characteristics, to facilitate external AI development. All of the following components are considered when determining where a system falls on the openness spectrum: Access stages: Developers may release publicly available AI systems through hosted or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be free or paid for. By hosting the system, developers maintain ownership and only allow basic interface interaction without seeing the internal components of the system’s infrastructure. API-based access enables outside deployers to integrate AI models into their own applications making AI technologies more accessible to a broader range of users. Open model: Making all the properties of the model publicly available, such as its architecture, capabilities, components, risks, and other characteristics of the model itself. An example is model cards, which provides an outline of the model’s performance, intended uses, and possible limitations. Like food nutrition labels, model cards are intended to be concise, one-page fact sheets that communicate key information and help build understanding. Open code: Making the source code of an AI system and other derived works related to it accessible because anyone can inspect, modify, and distribute the software. Open data: Developers may disclose the data sources and related information so that it is transparent and accessible for public use. An emerging practice is the documentation of a datasheet, which provides details about the data collection, context, purpose, and other characteristics of the data. It also provides information about potential biases, such as the geographical region or target group from which the data was collected. A fully open system will have all components, including model,&hellip;",

    "content": "Background Vermont, long known for its scenic landscapes and charming towns, is facing a new challenge: housing affordability. While home prices in the state have historically tracked national averages, the impact of Vermont’s limited housing supply was softened by its relatively stable and aging population, which kept the demand for housing at manageable levels. However, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered substantial migration to Vermont. Between 2019 and 2023, the state’s population grew by more than 23,000, with a net gain of 14,000 people in 2020 alone. Such growth is notably significant for a state with fewer than 650,000 residents. With more residents, the demand for housing has become significantly stronger, contributing to rising housing prices. According to Zillow, the median home value in Vermont jumped by about 50% in four years, from less than $250,000 in 2019 to more than $375,000 by the end of 2023. The Vermont Housing Finance Agency estimates that to meet new demand and stabilize unsustainably low vacancy rates, Vermont needs to build 30,000 to 40,000 additional year-round homes by 2030. Achieving that goal means building more than 5,000 homes annually through 2030, an ambitious target for a state that currently builds around 2,100 homes each year. Complicating matters further is Vermont’s aging housing stock, which ranks among the oldest in the nation. More than 25% of the state’s homes were built before 1940, with much of that housing requiring rehabilitation in the near future. Recent Reform Efforts On June 5, 2023, Gov. Phil Scott (R-VT) signed into law S. 100, the bipartisan “Housing Opportunities Made for Everyone (HOME) Act.” The law includes three categories of reforms aimed at increasing housing supply. 1) Zoning reforms The HOME Act preempts municipal zoning ordinances to allow for more housing development through multiple provisions: Allowing for more multifamily housing: Municipalities must allow duplexes anywhere single-family homes are allowed and must allow four-unit residential buildings on lots served by water and sewer infrastructure. Allowing for more density: Municipal bylaws must allow at least five units per acre. Affordable housing developments may add additional units up to a 40% increase in existing density. Reducing parking thresholds: Municipalities may not require more than one parking unit per dwelling for lots served by water and sewer infrastructure. Allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs): Municipalities may not subject ADUs to more stringent reviews or zoning criteria than single-family homes. 2) Reducing the burden of environmental reviews The HOME Act also made several changes to Act 250, a statewide land use regulation. Act 250 “provides a public, quasi-judicial process” for reviewing the environmental and social impact of major developments. Act 250 reviews can impose costly delays on housing development. The Vermont Department of Housing and Community Development commissioner estimated that an Act 250 review can add $2,000 to $6,000 to the cost of each new housing unit, and can prolong the development process, sometimes by months. The process usually involves soliciting feedback from the municipality, neighbors, state agencies, and interest groups before submitting an application to be&hellip;",

Nikki Budzinski (D-IL), Young Kim (R-CA), Eric Sorensen (D-IL), and Nick LaLota (R-NY) to tour the border and surrounding communities in Arizona and Nogales, Mexico, through the Bipartisan Policy Center’s American Congressional Exchange (ACE). The purpose: to better understand the urgent challenges and opportunities for bipartisan cooperation on U.S. immigration and border policy. The policymakers committed two days to substantive discussions and site visits with community leaders and policymakers; law enforcement and border patrol officials; legal scholars and practitioners; humanitarian and advocacy organizations; and private industry leaders across health, advanced manufacturing, higher education, and economic development. This ACE trip opened at Arizona State University in Tempe, where representatives joined industry leaders, advocacy groups, and academics from the ASU School of Transborder Studies to discuss economic and regulatory aspects of immigration, including impacts on workforce, higher education, talent supply, and U.S. economic competitiveness. The congressional delegation heard from Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), leading global producers of advanced semiconductors and beneficiaries of recent federal investment under the bipartisan Chips and Science Act. Combined, Intel and TSMC are investing over $60B in the Phoenix area and will create over 16,000 jobs. To successfully build out the domestic semiconductor industry and other advanced manufacturing capabilities critical to U.S. national security and global competitiveness, they and other regional employers have an urgent need to scale up a highly skilled workforce, and are working to recruit and train in the United States as well as streamline the immigration system to attract and retain global talent in the U.S. The members also heard from business advocacy organizations on the benefits that providing legal status to DACA recipients and the current undocumented workforce would have for agriculture, health care, and companies like TSMC and Intel. At the University of Arizona in Tucson, representatives met Rogers College of Law Dean Marc Miller and Professor Lynn Marcus, co-director of the Law College Immigration Law Clinic, which provides high-quality legal services to refugees and immigrants in the Tucson area who otherwise lack access to counsel. The group learned about the foundations of refugee and asylum law; the complicated and narrow definitions and processes used to decide asylum cases; and the multidimensional challenges in addressing a steep increase in the volume—as well as growing diversity in nationalities—of asylum-seeking migrants at the southern border. These trends have strained the legal structures tasked with processing asylum and other immigration cases and the legal services available to assist them. To better understand the humanitarian needs of those released from government custody to seek asylum, the representatives then visited Casa Alitas, a charitable organization supported by Catholic Community Services in Tucson that provides reception, food, clothing, case management, and travel assistance for migrant families in their first hours in the United States.

    "content": "On March 26, 2024, a portion of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland collapsed after a large container ship, the Dali, crashed into one of its support piers. The 1.6-mile-long bridge was built in 1977 as an additional crossing of Baltimore’s harbor to alleviate congestion on the two existing tunnel crossings. Although much remains uncertain, this blog answers basic questions about the rebuilding of the Key Bridge. 1) What will the cost and timeline look like for rebuilding the bridge? As the extent of damage is still being assessed, early estimates for the cost to rebuild the Key Bridge vary widely, ranging from $400 million to $2 billion. In contrast, construction of the original Key Bridge over four decades ago cost roughly $316 million, adjusted for inflation. Even according to more conservative estimates, the new Key Bridge will likely cost significantly more to rebuild due to the high price of building materials and changes in modern bridge design. State and federal officials do not yet have an estimated rebuilding timeline. Construction of the original Key Bridge lasted five years, and some experts expect that the Key Bridge will most likely take at least a few years to rebuild due to the project’s scale and complexity, while others have argued it could be completed within a year if prioritized and expedited. The timeline will depend significantly on how efficiently the site can be cleared, how quickly funding is lined up, and whether any permitting and environmental review procedures delay its reconstruction. 2) How can the bridge rebuild project be funded? The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Emergency Relief (ER) Program supports the repair and reconstruction of highways and roads that suffer damage due to natural disasters or catastrophic failures from an external source. The ER program is generally allocated a maximum of $100 million per fiscal year and can cover 80-90% of a project’s cost, with the remainder to be covered by states and/or local transportation authorities. However, in past incidents, such as the Interstate 35W bridge collapse in Minnesota, Congress has made exceptions to allow ER funds to cover 100% of the cost for a specific project. In late March, the Biden administration announced a $60 million “down payment” for initial rebuilding costs through the ER program. Members of the Maryland congressional delegation introduced bipartisan legislation in the House and Senate, authorizing the federal government to cover 100% of the cost for rebuilding the Key Bridge through the ER program, a proposal also supported by the Biden administration. However, some members of Congress have expressed opposition to the federal government covering 100% of the cost to rebuild. According to one estimate, insured losses for the Port of Baltimore could total $2 to $4 billion, including the costs of business interruption due to the collapsed bridge. The Port of Baltimore could also try to recoup rebuilding and business interruption costs from a liable party, though an investigation is still underway to determine what caused the Dali to lose power and&hellip;",

    "content": "In 2017, Ebony Ford was 25-weeks pregnant when she began to experience visual disturbances and shortness of breath—telltale symptoms of pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure. After an emergency c-section, her daughter was born weighing just 1 pound, and Ebony was placed on life support—thankfully, both recovered. During her subsequent pregnancy, Ebony chose a new health care team that prescribed a home blood pressure cuff, enabling Ebony’s doctors to monitor her vitals, adjust medication in real time, and promptly advise her when to seek further care. Ebony credits her healthier second pregnancy to having access to lifesaving care, such as a remote blood pressure cuff. Ebony’s story exemplifies the powerful potential of remote patient monitoring to improve health outcomes and patient engagement. As one NYU clinician notes, &#8220;We’re able to get our patients involved in their care &#8230; and the education helps them understand that everything they do impacts their health.” Remote patient monitoring leverages digital technologies to collect and relay patient data to health care professionals. It includes remote physiologic monitoring (RPM)—of data such as weight, blood glucose, or blood pressure— and remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM)—of self-reported data such as pain and activity levels. Realizing the full promise of remote monitoring requires providers and patients to navigate a complex logistical, technological, and regulatory landscape. This blog explores the steps needed for these technologies to go from promise to best practice. Our insights are informed by BPC’s report, The Future of Remote Patient Monitoring, field observations at NYU Langone Health, and a comprehensive literature review. Step 1: Patient Identification The first step toward realizing the promise of remote monitoring is identifying the patients who stand to benefit the most. Today providers have wide discretion on which patients to enroll. Research increasingly supports monitoring patients with serious or uncontrolled disease—for instance, people with high HbA1c and newly starting insulin—but no standardized clinical guidelines exist to focus monitoring on these patients. Further, a provider’s assumptions about a patient&#8217;s comfort with technology can bias the provider’s willingness to initiate remote monitoring. Indeed, research reveals inconsistencies in who is offered these services, based on factors such as age and where a patient lives. Clinicians concede, “Tech-savvy persons and high-literacy people are more likely to use &#8230; and less likely to offer to people who are less likely to use it.” Policy Recommendation: CMS should work with medical specialty societies to create clear eligibility guidelines that focus remote monitoring resources on patients with serious or uncontrolled disease and remove provider bias from the identification process. Step 2: Onboarding and Setup Once a provider identifies a patient for remote monitoring, the care team works with the patient to acquire and learn how to use the device. Choosing the best device can be challenging due to the lack of information regarding the effectiveness of devices. Even FDA-regulated devices may vary in accuracy and perform differently across demographic groups. For example, research has shown that pulse oximeters can be less accurate&hellip;",

    "content": "A nation’s competitiveness depends in part on its commitment to research and development (R&amp;D), which requires a highly skilled workforce. While the United States remains the prime destination for global talent, it is facing increasing threats in maintaining its competitive leadership amidst fierce competition from China. The Bipartisan Policy Center has consistently emphasized how an outdated legal immigration system restricts national security and competitiveness. This blog examines China&#8217;s strategic efforts to attract global STEM talent, another reason for legal immigration reform if the United States is to maintain global leadership in science and technology. Intensifying Competition from China In 2000, America’s gross domestic spending on R&amp;D was $360 billion—almost ten times that of China’s, at just $40 billion. This gap has since dramatically narrowed, with 2021 data showing United States spending at $710 billion and Chinese at $620 billion, proof of China&#8217;s focus on bolstering its science and technology expertise. China has also invested in creating a highly skilled workforce, with its science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent pool growing to match and, in some areas, surpass that of the United States In 2019, 1,550,000 bachelor&#8217;s students and 326,000 master&#8217;s students graduated with STEM degrees in China, significantly higher than the 429,298 bachelor&#8217;s and 142,775 master&#8217;s STEM graduates in the United States that year. In 2020, 71 Chinese universities ranked among the top 500 globally, a substantial increase from only 23 in 2010. These top-ranked Chinese universities graduated an estimated 26,500 STEM Ph.D.s in 2019, compared to 22,000 STEM Ph.D. graduates from similarly ranked American universities. Projections suggest that, by 2025, China will award nearly 77,000 STEM Ph.D.s annually, nearly double the estimated 40,000 in the United States. China’s Strategic Immigration Programs and Policies China’s rising status in science and technology can be linked in large part to its immigration policy. In the last two decades, the Chinese government has launched generous recruitment policies and programs on both national and sub-national levels to attract talent. Part of China&#8217;s strategy is government-sponsored, attractive incentives such as signing bonuses ranging from the equivalent of $420,000 to $700,000 to recruit top talent from around the world. Beyond the signing bonuses, China offers support packages that address common relocation hurdles, such as assistance with housing in the form of subsidies to buy homes and mandating that employers must find jobs for the spouses of recruited talent. These initiatives have resulted in the return to China of more than 500,000 Chinese nationals as of 2018, as well as the successful recruitment of over 20,000 talented individuals from abroad. The table below summarizes several programs and policies the Chinese government has implemented over the past two decades to attract, retain, and incentivize both Chinese and foreign professionals to contribute to its scientific and technological sectors.

The Bipartisan Policy Center hosted a reception on Wednesday, April 10, 2024, to recognize and celebrate this momentum. The event brought together members of Congress, their staff, and key stakeholders to cultivate and garner support within and beyond Capitol Hill. Congress is making significant progress in paid family leave policy. This includes the establishment of Bipartisan, Bicameral Paid Family Leave Working Groups, working tirelessly behind the scenes; the expansion of paid parental leave to more military families; and bipartisan efforts to strengthen the 45S Employer Credit for Family and Medical Leave. Bipartisan Paid Family Leave Working Groups In January 2023, Reps. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) and Stephanie Bice (R-OK) announced the creation of the House Bipartisan Paid Family Leave Working Group. Consisting of six Representatives, the group is committed to forging a bipartisan path forward. In December 2023, Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) followed suit, forming the Senate Bipartisan Paid Family Leave Working Group, adding eight senators to the mission.

Last year the House Working Group hosted six stakeholder meetings, welcoming a wide range of insights from paid leave advocates, state administrators, trade associations, and small businesses. Additionally, the announcement of the Senate Working group in December was paired with a formal Request for Information to gather further input to inform the groups’ efforts. The House working group released its policy framework in early 2024 and is now working to turn those ideas into legislation.  The framework includes a host of policy ideas ranging from utilizing private insurance to harmonizing paid leave programs across states. House Working Group’s Legislative Framework Public-Private Partnership Paid Leave Pilot: Funding to states who want to set up a new paid leave program. Coordination and Harmonization of Paid Leave Benefits Across States: Creation of an “Interstate Paid Leave Action Network (I-PLAN)” to help states with existing programs share best practices with one another.

Vanderbilt President Daniel Diermeier defended the university in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Colleges Are Lawyering Up to Avoid Becoming the Next Harvard Hailey Fuchs | POLITICO | April 3, 2024 As conservative lawmakers become increasingly involved in “the fight against perceived liberal bias on campus,” colleges and universities have turned to law and public relations firms for legal representation and crisis communications.

    "content": "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) authorized new technical assistance and pilot programs intended to help state, local, tribal, and territorial governments (SLTTs) build capacity and deliver infrastructure projects more efficiently and effectively. One such program, aimed specifically at supporting innovative project delivery and financing options, is now getting started over two years after the BIL was enacted. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is accepting applications for the Innovative Finance and Asset Concession Grant Program (IFACGP) until May 10, with three years of awards initially available, totaling $57.72 million. IFACGP was created to help public entities identify, evaluate, and plan public-private partnerships (P3s) in which private sector partners take on a larger role in the development, construction, maintenance, operation, and financing of infrastructure assets. P3s allow SLTTs to leverage private sector expertise and innovation in the delivery of world-class infrastructure projects, while often enhancing cost efficiencies and managing key project risks. How the Program Works IFACGP will provide two types of competitive grants: Technical Assistance Grants and Expert Services Grants. IFACGP grants can support a wide variety of tasks relating to pre-development or pre-construction activities for P3s but, importantly, cannot directly finance projects. However, by allowing public entities to hire employees or advisers to assist with P3s, IFACGP provides states with the opportunity to establish P3 offices specifically to prepare for and facilitate P3 opportunities—or supplement P3 capacity and expertise in states with existing offices. Having dedicated P3 offices is a best practice recommended in a Bipartisan Policy Center report on attracting private capital to public infrastructure. Such expert offices can also help to successfully advance these other key activities that can be supported by IFACGP grants: Asset Scans: Also known as an asset inventory, an asset scan creates a comprehensive list of all infrastructure assets owned by a public entity and their condition. An asset inventory can help public entities understand their infrastructure liabilities and existing assets in need of maintenance or replacement, helping them better anticipate and plan for future infrastructure investment needs. Asset inventories can also identify opportunities for cost and risk-sharing with the private sector. BPC previously recommended asset inventories as a best practice for all levels of government in order to establish a more modern, efficient infrastructure system across the United States. Example: In 2017, the District of Columbia created the Capital Asset Replacement Scheduling System, an asset inventory of nearly its roads, sidewalks, vehicles, pieces of equipment, and buildings. With nearly all District of Columbia-owned assets now included, the district is generally recognized as having one of the most complete capital asset management systems in the country. With the ability to determine the cost of all deferred maintenance across all infrastructure, their asset inventory system has become fundamental to how district officials plan for capital improvements and their annual budget—a financial management practice that has also been viewed favorably by bond rating agencies.

    "content": "If you ask the public what they think of Congress, decades of polling shows that you’ll get a negative response. If you ask the staff who work in Congress, you’re likely to get similarly cynical and dejected answers. But a new survey of senior staff suggests that some aspects of Congressional operations have noticeably improved in recent years, reaffirming that Congress has the power to change. Since 2019, Congress has been engaged in an effort to take stock of its internal operations, assess its strength compared to that of the sprawling executive branch, and boost its overall capacity that has been waning for decades. Essentially, Congress has been examining how it can get better at writing laws, helping constituents, and overseeing the federal government. These efforts were initiated by the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, which operated from 2019 to 2023 and passed over 200 bipartisan recommendations aimed at improving the first branch. In 2023, the Committee on House Administration established a new Subcommittee on Modernization to implement the Select Committee’s recommendations and seek out new ideas for boosting congressional capacity. These two member-led efforts, alongside counterparts in congressional support agencies and numerous external stakeholders, have diligently worked to improve the internal operations of the House of Representatives. Among other things, the congressional modernization movement has sought to address issues related to staff capacity, operational infrastructure, and the workplace culture of Capitol Hill. A new report from the Congressional Management Foundation (CMF) provides a snapshot of the impact of this work thus far. When it comes to boosting congressional capacity, the CMF report finds that senior congressional staff are noticing improvement. Across eight different measures including access to nonpartisan policy expertise, human resource support, and technological infrastructure there was a marked increase in respondents who were Very Satisfied with the institution’s performance, ranging from +6% to +20% across all measures since CMF’s last report in 2022. These findings underscore the tremendous successes of the modernization movement. As former Representatives Rodney Davis (R-IL) and Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) highlight in a recent op-ed, Congress has already implemented many of the technology and infrastructure recommendations of the Select Committee, and the efforts of the Modernization Subcommittee have led to the recognition of Congress as a world leader for its approach to generative AI within a legislature. Beyond technology, there have also been numerous advances in human resource support on Capitol Hill. The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) has launched numerous new programs to provide best practices and institutional support to the 441 otherwise independent member offices that have varying levels of management experience, such as a coaching program for staff, a centralized HR hub, and the House Intern Resource Office. These developments help further Congress’s ability to recruit, train, and retain high-quality staff, which is of particular importance in a tight labor market where positions outside the institution often come with better pay and improved work-life balance. The CMF report also brings some nuance to the ongoing narrative of congressional dysfunction. Respondents&hellip;",

    "content": "Next year, policymakers in Washington will once again confront the nation’s debt limit. Its current suspension, initiated by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), ends at midnight on January 2, 2025. One major factor in the Treasury Department’s management of government finances during debt limit episodes is the cash it has on hand when a given debt limit suspension ends. The size of these cash reserves dramatically impacts the timing by which policymakers must act to avoid the worst economic outcomes that come with jeopardizing the full faith and credit of the United States. A recently released 2021 Department of Justice opinion sheds new light on how Treasury has managed its cash on hand in the leadup to recent debt limit episodes and what officials might do next year. The X Date Absent congressional action to raise or further suspend the debt limit, Treasury will begin using its existing cash on hand and extraordinary measures in early 2025. Because the federal government is running large annual deficits, those resources will quickly deplete and the U.S. will cross the X Date, the day on which the federal government is no longer able to meet all its obligations in full and on time. The ramifications of any missed payments could be severe. Even approaching the X Date has negative economic consequences. Extraordinary Measures Treasury’s accounting maneuvers create additional room under the debt limit for Treasury to meet its financial obligations. Treasury has a number of tools in its extraordinary measures toolkit, including pausing reinvestments in the Thrift Savings Plan Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund) and the Exchange Stabilization Fund, whose securities mature daily. Treasury can also pause the crediting of interest income to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF), and delay rollovers of maturing securities to the CSRDF. Cash on Hand Since 2011, Treasury’s cash on hand has become an increasingly important determinant of when the X Date will arrive because Congress has generally shifted from raising the debt limit by a specified amount to suspending the debt limit for a specified period of time. From 1993 through 2011, Congress increased the debt limit 15 times and never suspended it. Since 2012, Congress has suspended the debt limit eight times and increased the debt limit just twice (both in 2021). When Congress raises the debt limit, Treasury’s net borrowing—and thereby its cash on hand—is directly constrained by that limit. In contrast, when a suspension ends, the debt limit is automatically increased by the amount of obligations the U.S. government has incurred during the suspension period. Congress limits the increase to “necessary” obligations of the federal government during the suspension period. Several, but not all, recent debt limit suspensions have also prohibited Treasury from increasing their cash on hand balance “above normal operating balances in anticipation” of the end of the debt limit suspension period. (The FRA includes this language.) Before 2021, “uncertainty” about the meaning of the statute led Treasury to draw down its cash balances to approximately match the cash on&hellip;",

    "content": "Happy tax day! Many Americans are well aware this time of year, albeit often begrudgingly, of how much they paid in taxes over the previous year. In January, the Bipartisan Policy Center launched an interactive tool—the Federal Taxpayer Receipt—that provides taxpayers with an itemized receipt showing how their federal tax dollars are allocated across government programs and services. A related new poll from BPC and Morning Consult provides insights into Americans’ perceptions of how their federal tax dollars are used. Our findings suggest that taxpayers generally perceive that their tax dollars are being spent inefficiently, but this changes when they are given more information—demonstrating how important public engagement is for fiscal policy. Are Federal Tax Dollars Spent Efficiently? Past research suggests that Americans typically do not think their tax dollars are being spent efficiently or effectively. Results from BPC’s latest survey bear this out, with some interesting variations, particularly by generation. The majority of U.S. adults responded that tax dollars are spent inefficiently (58%) with 30% saying somewhat inefficiently and 28% saying not at all efficient. When broken down by generation, Baby Boomers (67%) were the most likely to say tax dollars are being used inefficiently. Younger generations were slightly less likely to suggest the same: GenXers (59%), Millennials (55%), and GenZ (45%). Over two-thirds of Republicans (68%) felt that tax dollars are used inefficiently, compared to Independents (61%) and Democrats (46%). To test the extent to which taxpayer perceptions changed after receiving more information, participants in this survey were given an illustrative example generated using BPC’s Federal Taxpayer Receipt for an individual who paid $18,000 in federal income and payroll taxes in 2023, broken down by eleven primary spending categories. After seeing how federal tax dollars are actually distributed, Americans shifted their perceptions on federal spending: fewer respondents (46%) said their tax dollars are being spent inefficiently—a sizeable shift (12 percentage points) from the original 58%. Baby Boomers were the most likely to be influenced by the receipt, with only 51% still feeling that their tax dollars are spent inefficiently compared to the 67% before the receipt—a 16-percentage point swing. Republicans had the greatest shift in perceptions after seeing the receipt, with 54% still responding that tax dollars are used inefficiently compared to the initial 68%—a 14-percentage point swing. Independents (50%) and Democrats (36%) also shifted from their original responses. Table 1: Shift in Public Perceptions on the Efficiency of Use of Tax Dollars Before Tool After Tool Percentage Point Change All Respondents 58% 46% -12 Men 56% 45% -9 Women 60% 46% -14 Gen Z (Born                   1997 – 2012) 45% 38% -8 Millennials (Born 1981-1996) 55% 44% -11 GenXers (Born 1965-1980) 59% 47% -12 Baby Boomers (Born 1946-1964) 67% 51% -16 Democrat 46% 36% -10 Republican 68% 54% -14 Independent 63% 50% -13 Do You Know Where Your Tax Dollars Go?

    "content": "This blog was written in partnership between BPC and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville’s Baker School of Public Policy and Public Affairs. Global consumer demand for sustainable products and materials is increasing, driven in part by a growing recognition of the environmental impact of product and material sourcing, manufacturing, and end of life. Recent surveys show that consumers are willing to pay a price premium for products that are better for the environment. Innovation in wood products can meet this mounting demand while also displacing the use of more emissions-intensive materials. According to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization, the use of wood products results in lower greenhouse gas emissions over their lifecycle, when compared to products made from non-renewable or emissions-intensive materials like steel, cement, and plastics. Research further shows that when sustainably-sourced wood is used in place of other construction materials, there is an average emissions reduction of approximately 0.9 kilograms (kg) carbon for every 1 kg carbon in the wood used, with innovative management practices holding significant promise as nature-based solutions to climate change. Despite these trends, the United States lags Canada, Australia, and many European nations in commercializing innovative wood products such as mass timber building systems, wood fiber insulation, and wood fiber nanotechnologies. Significant federal policy opportunities exist to bolster wood innovation, building on the U.S. Forest Service’s Wood Innovation Grant Program that received new funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Farm &amp; Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force identified this as a policy priority, recommending that “USDA explore ways to support emerging markets for innovative wood products through new incentives for domestic manufacturers, federal procurement across executive branch agencies, and other options.” There is great potential for sustainably-sourced forest biomass to be used in a wide range of products beyond lumber and furniture. Applications such as biofuels, biochemicals, bioplastics, composites, and nanomaterials for the automotive, aerospace, electronics, and medical device industries can replace many emissions-intensive products. Vast domestic forest resources mean that the United States could be a global leader in innovative wood products, building on the foundation of today’s industry. Within the United States: Approximately 30% of the land area is forested. More than 50% of the 765 million acres of forestland are privately owned. The forest products industry employs approximately 950,000 people and contributes nearly 5% to domestic manufacturing GDP. Timber production represents two-thirds of forest land use. What limits market opportunities for forest products? The forest products market is constrained by several intersecting and compounding factors: decreased federal research capacity and funding for research at land-grant universities, coupled with reduced private sector investment has ultimately stifled the innovation needed to ensure the industry remains competitive. Slowed innovation and broader market forces have lowered the demand for products from the domestic forest sector. These converging challenges have constricted the forest science workforce, which further constrains the market: Federal research capacity in the forest sector has fallen by half in recent decades, with only 25%&hellip;",

Boosting a strong domestic manufacturing sector has long found supporters on both sides of the aisle. In its first 100 days, the Biden administration announced an executive order to develop a supply chain strategy, following the Trump administration’s establishment of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy in the same timeframe. Manufacturing is one of the largest sectors of the U.S economy, representing 11% of total gross domestic product. Despite this, manufacturing employment has fallen from its peak of nearly 20 million workers in 1979 to just under 13 million in 2024—all while the U.S. leads the world in funding for research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D), meaning that U.S. inventions are being manufactured elsewhere. There are clear national security benefits to maintaining a strong, domestic manufacturing sector that reduces reliance on volatile or adversarial nations. There are also economic benefits such as providing good-paying jobs to American workers, and environmental benefits of to reducing emissions from manufacturing processes and producing components for clean energy deployment. The federal government provides support through a variety of programs that address specific aspects of the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem. This guide provides a brief overview of these programs and their role in increasing U.S. manufacturing capacity, supporting manufacturing process innovation, strengthening supply chain resiliency, and setting manufacturing strategy. Programs focused on increasing U.S. manufacturing capacity  These programs focus on sustaining manufacturing capabilities and breaking through technological barriers.   The National Semiconductor Technology Center, established by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, is a forthcoming public-private partnership led by the Department of Commerce. The program seeks to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem through partnerships between government, industry, and academia to conduct research, design prototypes, and build a strong workforce.  The Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program is a program administered by the Department of Defense (DOD) to develop and deploy key defense-related manufacturing technologies and to accelerate manufacturing process innovation, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses.  The Advanced Manufacturing Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) programs funds research to address issues to revitalize American manufacturing across a range of key industries, with emphasis on multidisciplinary research to transform manufacturing capabilities, methods, and practices.  The Manufacturing Extension Partnership based at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a national network of centers located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico that provides services to small- and medium-sized manufacturers to improve production processes and upgrade technology.  The Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (45X) is an Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created production tax credit (PTC) aimed at incentivizing domestic production of clean energy technology components, including wind turbine blades, solar panel wafers, electricity inverters, batteries, and critical minerals.  The Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit (48C), expanded by the IRA, is an investment tax credit (ITC) for domestic advanced energy projects, including projects to produce or recycle clean energy products and projects to reduce emissions at manufacturing facilities.  Key&hellip;",

    "content": "The Senate is considering a bipartisan tax bill that, if passed, would grow the economy and extend financial support for working families. The bill proposes offsetting some of the costs for these provisions with changes to the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC). The ERTC is a pandemic-era tax credit that was designed to help businesses remain open and their staff employed during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent economic recession. Since then, the cost of the ERTC has far surpassed initial projections, in part due to fraudulent and improper claims. The bipartisan tax bill will reduce ERTC fraud and provide about $79 billion in offsets. When a Credit Outlives Its Policy Purpose The ERTC was initially enacted in the March 2020 CARES Act. Eligible employers could claim 50% of up to $10,000 in qualifying wages against their payroll tax liability annually. Employers whose operations were impacted by COVID-19 mandates or whose revenues decreased by 50% compared with the same quarter in the prior year qualified to claim the credit. Congress extended and enhanced the credit in late 2020 and again in 2021. The changes: Allowed employers to apply the ERTC to wages paid throughout the 2021 calendar year, Increased the maximum credit from $5,000 to $14,000 and then to $28,000, Extended eligibility to employers who received a Paycheck Protection Program loan, (PPP) loan, Created a new credit for recovery startup businesses, among other reforms. Following the ERTC’s expansion, an aggressive marketing campaign by advisors and firms advertised their services to help businesses claim the credit. These firms typically take a cut of 20% or more of the refund a client receives. Because taxpayers can amend their returns for up to three years, businesses can continue to file ERTC claims through April 2025. The IRS has seen a sharp uptick in ERTC claims in recent months. In September 2023, after the IRS had accumulated 3.6 million claims, the agency announced a moratorium on processing refunds. Many of those claims have since been deemed erroneous or even fraudulent. In December 2023 alone, 20,000 claims were denied. The claims backlog has grown to over 1 million, though this figure was last updated in December 2023. The total cost of the credit was initially projected to be $50 billion—now, projections exceed $550 billion. A Path Forward The bipartisan tax agreement under negotiation in the  Senate would expand the statute of limitations for the IRS to pursue fraudulent or erroneous claims of the credit and prohibit new claims after January 2024. These changes are estimated to raise or otherwise save $79 billion in federal coffers and help offset other reforms in the tax package. Why the ERTC Offset Matters Although many lawmakers in both parties support curtailing the ERTC, some have raised objections about its use as an offset in the bipartisan tax bill. There are three key reasons that curtailing the ERTC is a necessary and worthy offset. We’re Past the Worst of the Pandemic Placing a limitation on new ERTC claims&hellip;",

    "content": "For the first time in the United States, commercial-scale offshore wind is bringing power to the U.S. grid from an enormous, virtually untapped American resource. The United States has nearly 1,500 gigawatts (GW) or 1.5 million megawatts (MW) of fixed-bottom offshore wind technical potential, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. By 2030, the United States has a goal to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind generation capacity. But over the last eight years, the nation’s 0.042 GW of installed capacity has lagged China (31 GW) and Europe (30 GW) by an order of magnitude. So, it was a big deal when turbines began turning this month at Ørsted and Eversource’s newly operational South Fork Wind in New York, with Avangrid’s Vineyard Wind 1 in Massachusetts likely to follow close behind. This comes on the heels of a somewhat turbulent past 12 to 24 months, in which many U.S. offshore wind deals were being inked while others were canceled. What happened to create this seesaw effect in the industry, and does it spell trouble moving forward? High Interest Rates and High Cost of Capital 2022 was an optimistic year for the industry, with an unprecedented expansion into new leasing areas around the country and a significant number of projects entering the permitting phase. In the last 12 months, however, several offshore wind projects have stalled due to increasing project costs related to supply chain disruptions, higher interest rates, and the overall higher cost of capital. Project developers rely on revenue from selling power to an offtaker (typically a state utility) to fund project development. However, due to the long development timelines of large-scale energy projects, many of these power purchase agreements were negotiated during a more favorable financial environment and are no longer sufficient to cover increased project costs. Many developers of stalled projects plan to (or have already begun to) renegotiate and rebid their projects in the coming year. Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Logistics Challenges High-interest rates and the cost of capital are also constraining the needed expansion of domestic component manufacturing, ports, and specialized marine vessels for enabling a cost-effective pipeline of U.S. offshore wind projects. Offshore wind turbine fabrication requires specialty manufacturing. Much of the expertise in manufacturing offshore wind components currently resides in Europe, in large part due to the industry’s maturity on the continent. Onshoring offshore wind manufacturing could generate new market opportunities for domestic manufacturers and boost U.S. manufacturing employment. Offshore wind components for turbines, each typically capable of producing 6 to 8 MW, are often too large to transport over land. The growing offshore wind industry will require a network of ports with complementary capabilities like fabrication or assembly. According to a 2023 report from the Business Network for Offshore Wind, 35 offshore wind ports are either in development or have recently reached commercial operations. But these ports are facing material financing gaps due to higher-than-expected construction costs. A lack of U.S. wind turbine installation vessels is also a major challenge for&hellip;",

    "content": "On February 28, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a virtual gathering of mayors and policy experts to delve into the pressing issue of homelessness. Panelists engaged in a candid dialogue about the scale of the problem, shared insights into innovative policy approaches, and discussed best practices for cities working to prevent and end homelessness. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and former Houston Mayor Annise Parker joined policy experts Rosanne Haggerty and Phil Mangano as panelists. BPC President and CEO Margaret Spellings introduced the event, with former HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros moderating the conversation. This blog highlights key themes and takeaways from each of the panelists. The full recording of the event is available on BPC’s website. Mayor Karen Bass underscored the equal importance of housing and support services in meeting the needs of unhoused people. Lamenting the lack of a formal definition for &#8220;comprehensive services,&#8221; the mayor emphasized the importance of robust health care interventions to address behavioral health issues such as substance use disorders. She advocated for clear accountability measures for health care interventions, stressing the importance of long-term individual outcomes rather than just the number of people served by a program. Mayor Bass has wielded her executive authority to expedite housing construction in Los Angeles. During her first week in office, she issued Executive Directive No. 1 (ED 1), directing city departments to accelerate and streamline processes involved in affordable housing construction. Despite her focus on expanding the supply of permanent housing, she pointed out the growing need for interim housing solutions in Los Angeles—which provide shelter to unhoused people on a temporary basis—to prevent individuals from languishing on the streets while they wait for a permanent housing placement. Annise Parker, the former mayor of Houston who kickstarted the city’s celebrated approach to reducing homelessness, attributed the success to her administration’s efforts in uniting fragmented and siloed service networks into a centralized “command center.” Parker emphasized the pivotal role of committed leadership who are willing to expend political capital and employ “brute force” coordination among disparate groups if necessary to drive systemic change. The former mayor also noted some of Houston&#8217;s advantages, including a flexible housing market, lack of zoning, and a streamlined permitting system, which allowed the city to significantly add housing supply even as her administration worked to coordinate essential services and shelter systems. Rosanne Haggerty, president and CEO of Community Solutions, discussed the indispensable role of data collection in addressing homelessness effectively. Community Solutions collaborates with 105 communities across the country, providing best practices in data-gathering and coordination. By optimizing community resources, their model seeks to achieve “functional zero”—a milestone that indicates that fewer people are experiencing homelessness than are routinely exiting homelessness at any given time. Haggerty echoed Mayor Parker’s emphasis on a centralized approach to homelessness services. She With support from Community Solutions, 14 communities have achieved functional zero for specific populations such as unhoused veterans, illustrating the tangible impact of data-driven interventions.

    "content": "Last year was “a year of groundbreaking advances in AI and computing.” Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform almost every area of the economy, from business operations to the workforce. Opportunities and challenges exist with these technologies for businesses of all sizes, but the impact is felt more acutely by small businesses which often have fewer resources and increased barriers to adopting any new tool. A new poll by the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult offers several insights into small business AI use – both the good and the bad. Since small businesses make up around 44% of all U.S. economic activity, understanding how their owners successfully use technology is paramount to a strong national economy. Significant progress in connecting small business owners to AI has occurred over the last two years. In a 2022 BPC and Public First poll, 74% of small business owners believed digital skills were important to their business. However, only 21% of that group were early adopters of new technology, and only 52% planned on making investments in digital tools over the next year. The 2023 BPC and Morning Consult poll reveals that 83% of small business owners who use AI  say it has been helpful in improving systems, increasing efficiency, focusing time on more valuable tasks, and helping produce content. 54% say it has had a positive impact on business growth. Moreover, 33% of small business owners are early adopters of new technology, and 58% plan to invest in AI over the next year. Notably, the 2022 poll asked about digital tools broadly—any program, software, or application that runs on a digital device like a computer, tablet, or smart phone—while the 2023 poll focuses only on AI. In that short period of time, AI completely revolutionized the digital tool market, with many companies adding AI features to their existing platforms or producing AI-based products. This rapid change highlights the need for policymakers to catch and keep up with changes to better serve small businesses. Recent technological advancements play a central role in AI’s growing prevalence. Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that can generate text, images, or other data in response to prompts. In the last year, generative AI products, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have enabled individuals and small businesses to use this new technology without significant special training or equipment. Specifically, it enhanced the customer experience through chatbots, streamlined the research and brainstorming process, and even helped produce articles and marketing material. Minority small business owners have a better experience with AI than white small business owners. More Black (76%) and Hispanic (69%) than white small business owners (63%) believe AI will have a positive impact on their business two years from now. Black (75%) and Hispanic (77%) small business owners plan to make more investments in AI over the next year than white small business owners (54%). Male small business owners use AI more and have better experience with it than female small business owners. Male small business owners (38%) are&hellip;",

    "content": "The House’s impeachment of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas is the first time since 1876 that a cabinet secretary has been impeached and only the second time in history. But this is just the latest instance, as data show, in a pattern of increased threat of reprimand by Congress. As historian David Kyvig notes, we are living in an “age of impeachment,” and both parties have engaged in the practice. While the Senate may quickly dispense of the Mayorkas matter, the episode raises larger questions about the state of American politics and the proper recourse for holding political officials—elected or appointed—accountable. French scholar Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in 1835 that “when the American republics begin to degenerate it will be easy to verify the truth of this observation, by remarking where the number of political impeachments augments.” This sentiment has more recently been echoed by political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, who argue that a democracy’s decline often results from the excess use of institutional powers no longer restrained by informal or historic norms. That is, the breakdown of democracy can come about through the use of tools that are perfectly within an institutional officer’s authority. It does not require a breaking of process to signal a degrading of institutions. The Mayorkas impeachment marks the third impeachment passed by the House of Representatives in six years, a noticeable uptick compared to historical trends. Impeachment isn’t the only means by which public officials can be held accountable. There has also been an increase in other accountability mechanisms used for federal-level officials across the board. The figure above tracks the introduction of accountability mechanisms for federal officials in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Because we are counting introductions rather than passage of resolutions, it should be noted that certain instances of attempted accountability are counted multiple times. For example, four of the five expulsion resolutions in the 118th Congress are related to the removal of Rep. George Santos (R-NY). Still, as the figure shows, there has been a marked increase in the use of accountability mechanisms in recent years. It is true that these resolutions have primarily been introduced by just a handful of members of Congress. It is also true that accountability tools have been used for political gain throughout our history. However, the steep increase in use and the increased threats of their introduction indicates a shift in institutional norms around such tools. Members of Congress have signaled that they too believe the situation is beginning to escalate out of control. For example, some have proposed changing the constitutional threshold necessary for impeachment, and there have been numerous attempts to codify what constitutes an impeachable offense to provide more clarity than is given in the Constitution. Even casual observers of American politics can sense that the rise in intense partisanship has made our politics more aggressive and conflictual. The politicization of these tools runs the risk of enabling actual corruption to be discounted as nothing more than&hellip;",

    "content": "In recent years, heightened scrutiny has targeted the integrity of election processes, particularly regarding noncitizen participation in U.S. elections. We address here four frequently asked questions concerning noncitizens voting in American elections: Can noncitizens vote? How do election offices verify voters’ citizenship status? What are penalties for voting as a noncitizen? Have there been documented cases of noncitizen voting? Can noncitizens vote? The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections. It is not legal in any state for a noncitizen to cast a ballot in a federal election. While federal law does not prohibit noncitizens from casting a ballot in state or local elections, no state currently allows noncitizens to vote in statewide elections. Three states and Washington, DC, have municipalities that allow noncitizens to vote in certain local elections. San Francisco allows resident noncitizen parents and guardians to vote in school board elections. Oakland is currently attempting to enact a similar law. Some cities in Maryland and Vermont permit noncitizens to vote in municipal elections. New York City enacted a law allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections in 2021, but it was ruled unconstitutional by a state judge in 2022. Washington, DC, recently enacted a law to allow noncitizen residents to vote in all non-federal elections. As voting in federal and state elections is limited to citizens, communities that do allow noncitizens to vote maintain processes to ensure that a registered noncitizen voter cannot receive a ballot for state or federal races. Maryland’s cities, for example, maintain separate ballots for municipal elections. This ensures that noncitizens, who may only vote in certain local elections, cannot receive a ballot for state or federal contests. How do election offices verify voters’ citizenship status? The process of verifying voter citizenship varies across the United States. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to use a common voter registration form, which includes under penalty of perjury an attestation that the applicant is a U.S. citizen. States verify voter identity and information using state and/or federal databases, such as the Social Security Administration or state departments of motor vehicles. By cross-referencing information that the voter provides against information provided by these entities, election administrators can ensure that identifying information submitted on voter registration forms is accurate and legitimate. This hinders those who may attempt to register to vote using fraudulent or false information. What are penalties for voting as a noncitizen? Does voting by a noncitizen affect their immigration status? Illegally voting in a federal election can result in a fine and up to one year in federal prison. Additionally, a noncitizen found guilty of this crime may face deportation and revocation of their legal status under immigration law. Finally, falsely claiming U.S. citizenship for the purpose of registering to vote may also result in deportation or denial of future immigration status. Deterrence is an important factor in ensuring compliance with voting laws. The consequences for breaking federal election law can have&hellip;",

    "content": "In recent years, investing based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations has become a hot-button political issue. Few acronyms have equaled ESG’s ability to increase investment capital while simultaneously creating a political firestorm. Despite ESG driving trillions of investment dollars—largely through retirement investments—and numerous corporate commitments over the last two decades, financial traction has not translated into widespread tolerance. Individual states, a growing number of politicians, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the private sector, and even the European Union have taken varying positions and actions, leaving investors and asset managers—including those managing the American public’s hard-earned retirement savings—with questions and confusion as they attempt to reach a common path forward. The central question: Can politics be removed from retirement investing? How did we get here? The concept of ESG itself has no one accepted definition. First coined in 2005 by the United Nations, its factors have been analyzed and evaluated for decades before transforming in the 2010s into a new investment concept of “doing well by doing good.” How companies defined and measured risks became increasingly important as institutional investors and the international community pressed for more comprehensive disclosure. But as political issues became intertwined with the assessment process, investors began to evaluate ESG-related risks, including climate change, that they might not have otherwise considered material. The traditional concept of evaluating financially material risks has been replaced on one side by a vehicle through which to facilitate social and political change and on the other side by conflating it with “wokeism” and allegations of circumventing the legislative process. The divide could not be more stark, with some political stakeholders arguing that ESG-related-risks are always financially material, while others say that they are never financially material. To fully understand the related risks, however, one must focus on their connection to a shareholder&#8217;s long-term value, keeping politics—though not policy—aside. Policy over politics The investment conversation must be centered around risk management and competitive advantage. Traditionally, most agreed that the analysis of risks was best handled as a balancing act through a dialogue between a company&#8217;s board, executives, and investors. The oversight of this evaluation and subsequent public disclosure falls squarely within the SEC&#8217;s legislatively granted authority. The historic process for disclosure has usually been a principles-based approach unless otherwise mandated by Congress. The U.S. Supreme Court has also previously weighed in, finding that a factor (or a risk) must be disclosed if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would find it important to make a sound decision. These have been the “ground rules” for helping to ensure that political influence on investment decisions is kept at a minimum. Today, at a time when many state pension funds are severely underfunded and face questions over their long-term ability to meet commitments, any deviation from that fiduciary duty is malpractice. American retirees should not have to pay a virtue premium if the underlying metrics used to support that premium are shaky. Investors have a duty to take material risks into&hellip;",

    "content": "As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in early 2020, higher education experts warned that public colleges and universities faced the imminent threat of severe budget pressures similar to those of the 2008 recession. Yet, for the most part, these fears did not materialize. As part of its pandemic relief efforts, the federal government distributed nearly $76 billion in emergency funding for higher education, as well as hundreds of billions more to states for general budgetary relief. These federal relief funds played a pivotal role in preventing severe cuts, stabilizing state higher education spending, and lowering college costs for students. Yet, federal emergency funding fails to deliver a viable long-term solution to recessionary pressures for postsecondary education. Federal emergency funding is costly, potentially inefficient, and provides no guarantee for state institutions of higher education during the next recession. Rainy-day funds, designed to mitigate the impact of unexpected financial shocks, are essential for fostering greater resilience in higher education budgets and long-term financial sustainability in postsecondary education. The Vulnerability of Higher Education Funding During Recessions Higher education is highly susceptible to funding shortfalls during recessions, when nearly all states struggle to maintain spending levels as they face reduced revenues and balanced budget requirements. For states looking to trim spending, higher education funding is often first to go for three reasons: 1) it is a discretionary fund, with spending levels determined on an annual basis; 2) it is the third or fourth largest spending category in most states; and 3) institutions can generate external revenue—especially through tuition and student fees—to offset funding cuts. Consequently, some researchers characterize higher education funding as a “balance wheel” for state budgets. In times of economic downturns, states frequently implement more pronounced reductions in higher education spending compared to other budget areas. As a result, a recurrent pattern emerges where state funding decreases while tuition and enrollment rise. Figure 1 shows how the 2000 and 2008 recessions led to substantial cuts to state higher education appropriations and subsequently to many public institutions leveraging tuition dollars to fill that gap. As a result of the 2000 recession, for example, state educational appropriations declined by 17%, while net tuition revenue per full-time equivalent (FTE) student at public colleges and universities rose by 8%. Subsequently, state educational appropriations saw a more substantial drop of 23% between 2008 and 2012 due to the Great Recession. Net tuition revenue per FTE increased by 18% at public institutions during those years. Institutions that were unable to raise tuition sufficiently to compensate for lost revenues responded by reducing capacity, shrinking or cutting programs, or limiting supportive services for students. The countercyclical nature of higher education, with enrollment tending to rise in recessions, exacerbates these budgetary challenges. During economic downturns, uncertain job markets and layoffs push students to delay finishing their education and lead working-age adults to return to school. Enrollment during the Great Recession experienced a particularly sharp increase of almost 11%. Consequently, during economic downturns, institutions must often grapple with the challenge of reduced state&hellip;",

As a young advocate who grew up in foster care, I found myself in an orientation for a project at the Children&#8217;s Bureau, the federal agency over foster care, in 2013. It was my first time meeting birth parents who identified as advocates and the first time I heard a father share his sorrow over how his young child was harmed because of his parenting failures. I couldn’t believe that I heard a father talk about how he harmed his baby. This admission sent me into a whirlwind of anger and confusion. I remember thinking, “Who is this parent? What is he doing in this room?” At that time, I believed that most birth parents of children in foster care harmed their children intentionally; they chose drugs over loving their children, and they just didn’t care enough to get their lives together. His confession reinforced my belief. He doesn&#8217;t deserve a place among us. Dee: Hearing the shocking story of my peer, at the same orientation meeting, underscored how my own journey diverged. After a family member reported me, I spent nine years navigating a maze in search of mental health support for my child to no avail. I was not treated as a concerned parent but as someone who willfully harmed my children. This unjust perception left me feeling criminalized and misunderstood, fueling my skepticism about the system&#8217;s capacity to truly help. In my peers’ stories and my own I saw opportunities for prevention. What if I had gotten the help I needed in my community for my son? What if my fellow parent leaders got the support they needed early on to prevent a child welfare experience that felt cruel and inhumane? Listening to other experiences from parents and youth, I realized that the narrative around “bad parenting” was an unhelpful label and would not create the conversation needed; it was also necessary to highlight the inadequacies of response by multisystems to support families when they need help. Sixto: Dee’s story, revealing the injustices and challenges she faced in the child welfare system, directly contradicted my belief that most birth parents are neglectful. Her story was a game-changer for me. Storytelling is a catalyst for change Our stories weren&#8217;t mere storytelling; they were catalysts for change. Our participation in a meeting 10 years ago reflects a movement to lift up the experiences of those most impacted to improve our nation’s child welfare policies. These insights transformed our beliefs and drove our actions. That&#8217;s why we are part of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Child Welfare Initiative.

However, several challenges and uncertainties must be addressed in the coming decade by industry leaders and policymakers to ensure the long-term success of this technology and to support our climate goals. On February 8, the Bipartisan Policy Center hosted our second annual DAC Day, which brought together policymakers, industry leaders, and experts to dissect crucial technical and policy challenges that need to be addressed for scaling up DAC. The event included keynotes and panel discussions (here are links to the full agenda and recording). Below are five takeaways from this half-day event. 1) DAC is a necessary complement to emissions reductions and is needed at tremendous scale, yet is just getting started today. The science is clear; the IPCC and other independent experts continue to emphasize that meeting our climate goals will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), including DAC, in the coming decades. DAC technologies are proven, durable CDR solutions which serve as a baseline for best-in-class permanence of CO2 stored. Yet the gigaton scale (billions of tons) of CDR required by mid-century for meeting climate targets dwarfs today’s durable carbon removal capacity. DAC technologies are operating at around 5,000 tons/year today with facilities operating in Iceland, California, and Colorado, and even larger projects are under construction today in Texas. Policy support from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Inflation Reduction Act are catalyzing industry interest in deploying DAC, and we can expect to see millions of tons of DAC capacity deployed in the United States in the coming years. 2) The DAC Hubs are accelerating shovel-ready technologies and elevating earlier-stage technologies to the commercial scale. The BIL’s $3.5 billion DAC Hubs program is poised to accelerate DAC projects through shared infrastructure and new private-sector partnerships with government-backed support. Two potential hubs—in Texas and Louisiana—are well along in their negotiations with DOE, and 19 additional hub proposals are in earlier stages of scoping across the country. As the nascent DAC industry begins to take flight, the hubs program has helped forge new partnerships between industrial actors and DAC companies around a common purpose. Right now is an important moment for the program, as we near the end of negotiations on a first round of funding and questions are being asked about how to effectively structure future funding to meet industry where it stands today. DAC companies at earlier stages of technology readiness undoubtedly have a role to play, but the hubs are squarely about enabling scale. Companies at earlier stages today will eventually benefit from shared infrastructure at the hubs, but DOE is carefully examining barriers that hub applicants face today in order to set the industry up for success in future&hellip;",

    "content": "As the U.S. population rapidly ages and demand for long-term services and supports (LTSS) steadily rises, policymakers should take steps to ensure the health care system is equipped to deliver the high value care older adults and individuals with disabilities deserve. While these actions require policymakers to make certain up-front investments, doing so has the potential to reduce federal and state spending while improving Americans’ lives. This is especially true for the estimated 12.8 million Americans who are jointly enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. These individuals, known as dually eligible beneficiaries, often have complex, long-term needs that tend to require more care. To adequately serve these beneficiaries, our chronic care system requires effective coordination between Medicare and Medicaid, and a robust direct care workforce that can deliver integrated services. However, our system is failing on both of these fronts, leaving beneficiaries with fragmented care and poor health outcomes, while also increasing federal and state health care spending. Make Medicare and Medicaid Work Better for Dually Eligible Beneficiaries Navigating health care can be a challenge, especially for dually eligible beneficiaries. Because of their complex medical and nonmedical needs, dually eligible beneficiaries often require more services than beneficiaries do in only Medicare or Medicaid, and they face multiple social risk factors, such as food insecurity. When Medicare and Medicaid plans fail to coordinate services for dually eligible beneficiaries, there&#8217;s a risk that these individuals won&#8217;t receive appropriate care in the most suitable setting. This often leads to care influenced by conflicting state and federal regulations and separate funding sources. Integrated care models that align the delivery, payment, and administration of services under both Medicare and Medicaid offer a promising avenue for improving health outcomes and equity while simultaneously increasing long-term cost savings. However, as of 2022, only about 21% of full-benefit dually eligible beneficiaries were enrolled in integrated care models. One integrated care model that stands out is Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). The model offers medical, social, and rehabilitative services to frail older adults who need nursing home-level care, but who wish to remain in their communities. Despite PACE’s proven track record of improving care for dually eligible beneficiaries and producing modest Medicaid cost-savings compared to care provided under a Medicaid waiver or in a nursing home, the uptake of PACE has been slow. PACE can reduce costly, preventable hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and institutional stays while lessening racial and ethnic disparities. The program also helps meet the growing demand for home and community-based services, particularly crucial in rural areas due to the higher percentage of adults ages 65 and older and a greater prevalence of adults with multiple chronic conditions, as compared to urban areas. Yet, PACE is out of reach for many. BPC released a report that unpacks the various challenges to growing PACE and offers federal policy solutions. The Direct Care Workforce Shortage Limits Care Access To increase access to integrated care models like PACE, policymakers must also address urgent health care workforce shortages, including&hellip;",

    "content": "Ver el análisis de la encuesta. There has been a long-standing assumption that Hispanic parents are the least likely to prefer and rely on formal child care (care provided by a center or family child care home.) Anecdotes suggest that Hispanic parents prefer for relatives to provide care because of cultural values known as “familism.” This kind of care is also known as informal child care, care provided by relatives, parents, non-live-in nannies, or other friends and neighbors. Familism not only places high value on the family unit, but also places the expectation that the family unit takes precedence over individual interests within the unit. Until now, data on employed Hispanic parents’ child care preferences, and how culture impacts decision-making was not available. The Hispanic population is growing faster (from 51 million in 2010 to 62 million in 2020) than non-Hispanic white and Black populations. Understanding the child care needs of this growing population is crucial. In December 2023, BPC continued our work on understanding parent preferences and surveyed employed Hispanic parents to understand their child care priorities and preferences. Do they prefer formal vs. informal care? Do they prefer school readiness over cultural teachings? Is there a preference for relative care due to culture? By answering these questions, BPC sought to not only better understand Hispanic parents’ child care needs but also confirm or dispel the belief that Hispanic parents prefer informal child care because of culture, or familism. Key survey findings are highlighted below. What Matters Most to Hispanic Parents when Choosing Child Care? Whether Hispanic parents are using formal or informal child care, the following are the most and least important factors when it comes to selecting a child care provider: The Role of Latino Culture in Child Care Arrangement Hispanic parents’ likelihood of relying on a formal child care arrangement is not negatively impacted by a provider not offering culturally relevant teachings or activities. This is true across parent’s generational statuses and current use of informal or formal child care. However, 58% of all surveyed Hispanic parents, and 65% of those relying on a formal child care arrangement believe it is essential or important but not critical for their child care provider to incorporate Latino cultural practices, traditions, or values in their care. Employed Hispanic Parents Current Child Care Arrangements Current child care arrangements are working for most Hispanic parents, 73% of those relying on formal care and 67% relying on informal care, prefer their current arrangement even if child care were free and in a convenient location. However, some Hispanic parents relying on informal care express interest in formal care under certain conditions: 56% are absolutely certain or would very likely consider formal child care if it were affordable and within their budget. 65% would be absolutely certain or very likely to consider formal child care if it were located inside their work or their spouse’s workplace. Most (78%) Hispanic parents need child care during traditional work hours, 8am-6pm, and over one third (35%) also&hellip;",

    "content": "As the United States continues to experience labor shortages in various areas, the Department of Labor (DOL) has an effective tool at its disposal to help address it. Regularly updating Schedule A—a list of occupations for which DOL has determined there are not sufficient workers in the U.S.—would allow businesses to more easily fill critical vacancies through immigration. In December 2023, DOL published a request for information (RFI) to solicit expert input on which Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM occupations should be included in the list. This post examines why now is such an opportune time for action, and how we can effectively update Schedule A to tackle labor shortages now and in the future. A Brief Overview and History of Schedule A Schedule A, created by DOL under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1965, is a list of occupations for which  there are insufficient U.S. workers who are “able, willing, qualified, and available.” If a U.S. employer’s vacancy falls within one of these occupations, they do not have to obtain an individual “labor certification” from DOL to sponsor a foreign national for legal permanent resident status. This exemption is valuable to businesses because obtaining labor certification is a complex process involving a supervised domestic recruitment effort to prove to DOL that there are insufficient able, willing, and qualified U.S. workers to fill the role they intend to sponsor the immigrant to work in, and that hiring foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed workers. The multi-step process can take well over a year, is exacerbated by growing backlogs, and can cost businesses thousands of dollars. In its original regulation in 1965, Schedule A contained just three categories of employment, but the rule allowed the secretary of labor to amend this list “at any time, upon his own initiative.” DOL used this authority in subsequent years to update the list based on economic needs. In 1991, following the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, the Labor Market Information Pilot Program intended to strategically study labor market data to enable informed annual revisions to Schedule A. In 1994, however, the program expired without any of its conclusions implemented. Today, only nurses, physical therapists, and immigrants of exceptional ability are listed on Schedule A, with no changes having been made for more than 30 years. The Time is Ripe for an Update The negative impacts of labor shortages are wide-ranging, with U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis showing nine of 13 industry classifications facing shortages in January 2024. As businesses struggle to fill vacancies, economic growth is restricted and consumers face fewer choices and higher prices. The impacts are not just economic. Beyond just nurses and physical therapists, our health care sector is among the worst affected by labor shortages, with BPC analysis identifying a long-standing shortage of direct care workers including personal care aides, certified nursing assistants, home health aides, residential care aides, and psychiatric aides.

    "content": "Breakthroughs in various clean energy technologies are essential to establishing cost-effective pathways and avoiding abrupt transitions toward a cleaner economy that can meet our energy demands while achieving net-zero emissions.  In the transportation sector, innovation in clean technologies like electric vehicles have garnered much attention while low carbon fuels such as electrofuels (e-fuels), which can replace conventional fuels, have been relatively overlooked. What Are E-fuels? E-fuels, also known as power-to-fuels, Power-to-X (PtX or P2X), synthetic fuels, or electro fuels, refer to a diverse range of low-carbon fuels synthesized from their chemical constituents (such as hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2)) utilizing clean energy, rather than derived from fossil fuels or traditional petroleum refining processes. E-fuels can take various forms, including gaseous options like e-methane, or synthetic natural gas (commonly referred to as Power-to-Gas), and liquid synthetic fuels such as e-methanol, e-diesel, or e-kerosene (Power-to-Liquid). Derived from clean energy sources like renewables, e-fuels are regarded as energy carriers, much like hydrogen. Consequently, e-fuels can also serve as energy storage solutions. While hydrogen is sometimes considered an e-fuel, this blog will focus on e-fuels that are drop-in replacements for other fuels. How Are E-fuels Made?  E-fuel production involves various technologies and has two main steps: feedstock production and fuel production.   Feedstock Production: The chemical constituents for e-fuels (water, H2, CO2, N2) can be produced in a low-carbon manner from various sources. Clean hydrogen production methods have been discussed in a prior blog. CO2 can be sourced from industrial waste gas, biogenic sources (like biorefineries or digesters), captured from point-sources via carbon capture or from ambient air using direct air capture (DAC). N2 can be separated from air using various air separation technologies and methods.  Fuel Production: Once these feedstocks or building blocks are available, electrochemical, thermochemical, or biological methods can be used to produce syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2) or higher-order e-fuels.  Electrochemical Method: Using excess clean energy and select electrodes, CO2 and water can be reduced to produce syngas or other intermediates like formic acid. Syngas can be used directly or further synthesized to produce fuel through thermochemical or biological methods. Often referred to as co-electrolysis or electrocatalytic reduction, this method is also capable of directly producing e-fuels such as methanol, methane, ethylene, and ethanol. Twelve, an early-stage commercial-scale carbon transformation company, utilizes direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 to produce sustainable aviation fuel or e-jet fuel.  Thermochemical Method: Refers to the utilization of catalysts, at elevated temperature and/or pressure to convert syngas into e-fuels. Air Company, a carbon utilization company, produces e-jet fuel using a thermochemical process referred to as Fischer-Tropsch (FT).  Biological Method: Converts syngas to hydrocarbons through biological techniques such as fermentation. LanzaTech, a sustainable fuels and products company, employs a proprietary biocatalyst and fermentation to produce ethanol. This ethanol serves as a precursor for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (also known as alcohol-to-jet) or chemical commodities.  An often-overlooked, non-hydrocarbon variant of e-fuel is e-ammonia, produced through electrochemical or thermochemical (Haber-Bosch) methods, utilizing&hellip;",

    "content": "In 2023, there were a record-setting 28 billion-dollar natural disasters in the U.S., totaling $93 billion in damages. As the costs of weather and climate events increase, so too does reliance on federal programs to direct assistance to survivors and communities in need. However, accessing this assistance is a challenge for both individuals and public officials because the system for delivering federal aid is complex. After seeking feedback from disasters survivors and the public, FEMA recently announced a slate of reforms to improve access to its Individual Assistance (IA) program. While the changes are a positive step forward, further action is needed to simplify the provision of disaster aid across programs and agencies. This blog outlines some of the remaining challenges survivors and state, local, Tribal, and territorial (SLTT) officials face when applying for federal disaster assistance and explores how a universal application could improve the process. Complex and redundant disaster assistance processes burden survivors. Disaster survivors often deal with trauma associated with lost loved ones and damaged or destroyed homes and are forced to find temporary housing and living situations for their families in the wake of a disaster. Amidst this turmoil and chaos, they also must assess damages, file insurance claims, and navigate federal assistance programs to access resources to address housing and property damage and other disaster-related costs. FEMA’s Individual Assistance and the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Disaster Loan Program are the primary sources of direct federal assistance to survivors in the short term after a disaster. FEMA and SBA applications demand a lot of work from disaster survivors, requiring them to compile comprehensive personal information and details about the extent of damage. For example, the SBA application asks for a catalogue of household debt owed and valuation of assets, such as a valuation of property and residences prior to the disaster as well as the value of all bank and retirement accounts. FEMA and SBA’s applications are also frequently duplicative. A BPC review of the applications found 16 questions on the FEMA disaster assistance application that are at least somewhat duplicative of questions on the SBA Disaster Home/Sole Proprietor Loan application, with some of those questions including multiple components. For example, both applications ask whether survivors have home insurance, and if so, to provide additional information about the type of policy and the insurance provider. In some cases, FEMA and SBA ask related questions but request different levels of detail, so applicants cannot simply copy answers, as shown in the insurance-related questions below. In the past, survivors often needed to apply for FEMA assistance, then apply for SBA loans, and wait for the SBA loans to be denied before they could be eligible for further assistance. This process confused many survivors: they were unsure whether they would be required to accept a loan if approved, worried that a loan denial would damage their credit score, and puzzled as to why they should fill out an SBA application if they are not involved in a small business.&hellip;",

Yet this strength masks a concerning long-term trend dating back to the 1950s— declining men’s labor force participation. For men aged 25-54 in particular, BLS data shows that the participation rate has declined from a high of 98% in September 1954 to 89% in January 2024. A recent BPC-Artemis survey of non-working, prime-age adults (defined in the survey as ages 20-54) sheds light on the factors preventing today’s prime-age men from entering the workforce. The survey considers both those who are not looking for work (out of the labor force) and those who are seeking work (unemployed). For prime-age men not seeking work, health-related barriers are the most prominent reason, raising the importance of policies such as sick leave, health insurance, and flexible work arrangements that could encourage some to enter the labor force. Finding 1: Men out of the labor force are significantly more likely to cite a health-related barrier than unemployed men looking for work. Fifty-seven percent of prime-age men not in the labor force said their main reason was their physical or mental health, with 55% citing a disability, serious illness, and/or receiving disability benefits, and 2% citing a mental, emotional, or behavioral health reason. This was significantly different from men who are looking for work, of whom only 16% said their physical or mental health was the main reason they were out of work. Finding 2: Men out of the labor force indicate that paid sick leave, health insurance benefits, and mental health benefits are important when considering entering the workforce. Fifty-two percent of prime-age men out of the labor force indicated health insurance benefits as a very important consideration when deciding whether to enter or return to the workforce. Workplace benefits were close behind, including paid sick leave, accommodations for disability, flexible work arrangements, and paid personal medical leave. Otherwise, 40% of men out of the labor force considered the provision of mental health benefits as very important for starting to work. Meanwhile, 28% of prime-age men out of the workforce due to physical or mental illness specifically said they would have been more likely to have stayed in their past job if they had access to paid personal medical leave. Finding 3: Men are less likely than women to raise caregiving challenges as impediments to seeking work. &nbsp; While women bear the brunt of caregiving responsibilities, just over 30% of non-working prime-age men also cited caring for others—including a seriously ill, special needs, disabled, or aging family member—as a reason for not working. This figure did not differ significantly between men who were looking for work and those who weren’t. Access to paid leave to care for a family member is not as important a factor for men when deciding to start or return to work as it is for women. When asked if&hellip;",

Informal child care: Care provided by relatives, parents with alternating work schedules, a non-live-in nanny, or other friends and neighbors. Moving is stressful and expensive.  It often comes with the challenges of securing a new job, finding a new home, and getting involved in a new community. Given the obvious downsides of moving, BPC finds that 25% of working parents with young children who depend on relatives for child care are either relocating closer to family or having family move closer to them to assist with child care. In the last three years, BPC conducted 10 surveys of parents to understand the complexities of parent choice and considerations when choosing child care. We learned that safety, cleanliness, and, most importantly, trust, are the key factors parents consider when choosing a child care provider. The fact that so many families are willing to move so that a trusted family member can care for their children is significant. Why does this matter? There is a shortage of child care providers in this country. BPC’s analysis of the supply of care available versus the potential need for care, or the “child care gap,&#8221; shows that 32% of young children with both parents in the workforce do not have access to a formal child care space. But how much of that gap is actually unmet demand?  Are parents not using the formal child care system because it is not available, or for reasons we don’t yet fully understand? Not all parents want to enroll their children in a child care center or family child care home. In fact, 57% of parents who use informal care would continue to do so, even if a formal child care option was free and conveniently located. This means that, while there are parents who would prefer a formal care arrangement if it were available, there are some who will never enroll in formal care. It&#8217;s possible that the 25% of working parents who either moved or had relatives move for an informal care arrangement are likely part of the community of parents who wouldn’t use formal child care even if it was free and conveniently located. This motivation provides valuable insights into how much of the child care gap is actual unmet demand and the complexities involved in developing a system parents trust. Effective policy must be grounded in parent preferences. There is still more work to be done to understand parents’ child care preferences, especially at the state and local level. These decisions have implications for children, families, and local economies. Our surveys show that child care has an impact on parents’ significant life choices, including how much (or if) parents work, where they live, and how many children they have. Policymakers and advocates from across the country are working to address the child care shortage; however, expanding child care supply without understanding parent preferences will not be effective.

    "content": "Our nation’s fiscal trajectory is unsustainable, a reality underscored by the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) February 2024 report on the budget and economic outlook of the United States. Rising budget deficits, rapidly increasing debt, and significant interest payments on the debt pose threats to economic growth, policymakers’ ability to address domestic and global challenges, and the United States’s leadership in the world. CBO’s “baseline” projections are used each year to help inform policymakers and experts as they devise and debate ways to improve the nation’s fiscal outlook. This blog highlights key takeaways from CBO’s report. The deficit will hit $1.6 trillion this fiscal year (5.6% of GDP), a slight decrease from last year’s $1.7 trillion deficit. Over the next decade (FY2025-2034), the annual deficit will increase by $786 billion (44%) to $2.6 trillion (6.1% of GDP). As spending continues to outpace revenues, deficits will exceed $1.5 trillion (an average of 5.6% of GDP) in each of the next ten years. In comparison to May 2023’s budget outlook, deficits are projected to be a cumulative $1.4 trillion less over FY2024-2033. Contributing to this are: A $2.6 trillion decrease in cumulative deficits due to legislative changes, namely the discretionary spending caps enacted under the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) in June 2023; and A $1.2 trillion increase in cumulative deficits from technical and economic changes, including the impact of corporate profits on tax revenues or changes in interest on net interest costs. The gap between revenues and outlays is only expected to increase, laying the groundwork for rising deficits through FY2054. Revenues will increase 2.3 percentage points, from 16.5% of GDP in FY2023 to 18.8% of GDP in FY2054. Spending increases will outpace revenue increases, going from 22.7% of GDP in FY2023 to 27.9% of GDP in FY2054 (a 5.2 percentage point jump). Over the next three decades, deficits will steadily increase, from 6.3% of GDP in FY2023 to 9.1% of GDP in FY2054 (a 2.8 percentage point jump).  Debt held by the public (the portion of the country&#8217;s total debt that is owed to individuals, businesses, and foreign governments) will be $28 trillion (99% of GDP) by the end of this fiscal year. Debt is expected to grow considerably to reach $48 trillion (116% of GDP) by FY2034—a higher level of debt than at any time in the nation’s history. Over the next three decades, debt will increase from 97% of GDP in FY2023 to 172% of GDP in FY2054 (a 75 percentage point jump). CBO adjusted its projection of this year’s (FY2024) debt held by the public to be $509 billion higher than expected in last year&#8217;s baseline report. While the debt is predicted to rise to $46 trillion in FY2033, that level is roughly $1 trillion lower than projected in last year&#8217;s baseline. Net interest costs will increasingly crowd out other expenditures. Last year, net interest costs surpassed Medicaid spending, and they are projected to surpass defense spending this year and non-defense discretionary spending next year.  From FY2025 to FY2034,&hellip;",

Johanna Alonso and Sara Weissman | Inside Higher Ed | January 26, 2024 The University of California Board of Regents met to discuss whether departments and campus centers should be allowed to publish statements on social issues “via official channels of communication.” Supporters of the move say that messages on departmental websites may be mistakenly considered representative of every department member or the whole university; critics say that prohibiting statements curtails academic freedom. The proposal has been tabled until the next meeting in March. American University Bans Indoor Protests Jessica Blake | Inside Higher Ed | February 1, 2024 American University President Sylvia Burwell announced that the university has banned all indoor protests in a recent letter to the campus. The letter states that the decision was made in response to “recent events and incidents on campus have made Jewish students feel unsafe and unwelcome.” The university’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors criticized the decision, arguing that it will have “the effect of suppressing and chilling expression.” Law Schools Must Adopt Free Speech Policies to Maintain ABA Accreditation Lexi Lonas | The Hill | February 6, 2024 The American Bar Association approved a new accreditation policy that extends free speech protections to all law students, staff, and faculty. The new standard requires law schools to adopt written policies that protect “robust debate, demonstrations or protests” and prohibit conduct that interrupts free speech.

    "content": "From bill introduction, through committees, to final passage, the iconic Schoolhouse Rock segment “I’m Just a Bill” illustrates the ideal path of successful legislation in Congress. Yet, this textbook legislative process no longer reflects what really happens in Congress—a big part of why Congress is struggling to function. Reinvigorating Congress’ committee system is a prerequisite to “cleaning up” the House. This blog explains two approaches to reforming the committee system. First, changes to the House rules—which determine which bills receive floor votes and whether amendments can be offered—would reduce procedural roadblocks in the legislative process. Second, increasing the resources available to committees would improve their capacity for policymaking. The Critical Role of Committees Committees should be the center of Congress’ legislative development. Committee meetings have historically allowed members and staff to develop the necessary policy expertise to craft legislation vis-à-vis the executive branch, and debates within committees are one of the few remaining venues for bipartisan interaction on policy issues. Throughout history, Congress’ committee system has had differing levels of influence over legislative outcomes. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 weakened the committee system, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s 1990s reforms—which weakened congressional capacity in what scholars often term the “big lobotomy”—helped usher in the current era of strong party leadership. With the rise of strong party leadership came changes to the legislative process. Today, important bills are frequently written by the majority party’s leadership and brought to the House floor with little to no committee consideration or opportunities for amendments. Bill text is sometimes made available to members mere hours before scheduled votes. Additionally, leadership decides which bills will be brought to the floor for a vote, meaning that they can prevent bills with significant support from reaching the floor if they conflict with leadership’s priorities. House rules include a few mechanisms designed to facilitate floor consideration of committee-reported legislation; however, these mechanisms are rarely, if ever, used. Reforms to these rules can put the House committee system back on the right track and address the nearly ubiquitous complaints about a lack of “regular order” lawmaking among rank-and-file Republicans this Congress. 1. Consensus Calendar The Consensus Calendar was designed to help bills with high rank-and-file support reach the floor for a vote. It declares that if a bill that has obtained 290 cosponsors (a two-thirds majority) is not reported out of committee within 25 legislative days, it is automatically placed on the Consensus Calendar. House majority leadership is required to consider at least one bill from the Consensus Calendar during each week in session. Increased use of the Consensus Calendar can be a useful tool for the rare bill with broad support which the majority leadership does not want to come to the floor. However, it is unlikely to significantly change House power dynamics as it is best suited towards bringing bills with supermajority support to the floor. Those bills generally have a good chance of reaching the floor as party leaders tend to support items once the majority&hellip;",

    "content": "On January 30, the Bipartisan Policy Center, in partnership with Mastercard, hosted a one-day symposium: The Future of Data-Driven Financial Services. This one-day symposium had over 150+ attendeees and consisted of speakers and expert panelists sharing their regulatory, industry, and market-forward perspectives on key issues. The financial services sector is being continually transformed by digitization, as well as the rapid utilization and consumption of data. From payment systems to underwriting, asset management to digital footprints, nearly every American has been affected by these changes. As the digital market outpaces regulatory frameworks, hear what panelists had to say on how policy can adapt to protect people without hindering innovation. Currency is Not a Partisan Issue The day began with members of Congress from both parties sharing their views on the future of data-driven financial services. They discussed a future where consumers own their data, and their efforts to promote policies that protect consumers’ digital assets. The House Financial Services Committee is pursuing legislation that does this without interrupting the pace of development-seeking to strike a balance between innovation and privacy. With this, there are opportunities to inform Congress on how financial data has been used, the positives of the features, and the potential of open banking and machine learning for consumers. Data is the New Oil As more users are allowing access to their information on various platforms, that data becomes more valuable. While regulators support the objectives of these cutting-edge apps, they want to make sure users have security and privacy, while knowing who to hold accountable if the trust is broken. From a regulatory standpoint, the core fundamental risk management and controls remain the same: data integrity and confidentiality of data. To mitigate these risks, coordination and collaboration between agencies is necessary to create systems where consumers can access their data directly so that they are empowered and have true ownership and trust of their data’s safety. If vulnerable consumers understood how to respond to threats posed, overall financial health would improve. It’s Not Just About Innovation, it’s About Responsible Innovation. Tech giants and financial services companies are asking: are our products delivering what they promised? Do consumers have access? Are we providing good user experience? How can we foster trust from our consumers to handle their information responsibly? Banks and fintechs agreed that these questions implicate governance and the need for consistent levels of protection throughout the ecosystem, especially as cybersecurity continues to threaten both the legacy and startup providers. As development surges, regulators focus on financial inclusion. Consumers require fairness, equity, and security to address biases, making responsible innovation essential. To ensure AI curtails rather than amplifies bias and discrimination in the financial sector, policymakers, regulators, and industry need to ensure the right safeguards are in place.  Having a human checkpoint can help mitigate bias and bridge community gaps to make finance more accessible. Conclusion Digitizing financial services is not new, what is new is the speed with which the technology is being developed, implemented, and adopted&hellip;",

    "content": "Choosing the age at which to claim Social Security&#8217;s Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) benefits is one of the most consequential decisions related to retirement security anyone will make. Individuals can claim reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62, but the longer one waits to claim (up to age 70), the higher their monthly benefit amount. These adjustments are intended to ensure that an individual with average life expectancy receives approximately the same level of lifetime benefits regardless of when they begin receiving benefits. But these actuarial adjustments were developed decades ago, and significant changes in longevity and interest rates have skewed the adjustments. Today, claiming at a later age nets the average retiree more benefits over their lifetime. Thus, the decision of when to claim Social Security benefits can entail tradeoffs between monthly income, total expected lifetime benefits, longevity protection, and the immediate need or desire for income. As BPC explained in a 2020 report: &#8220;A younger claiming age may yield higher expected lifetime benefits (e.g., because the claimant expects to live a shorter life than average), but an older claiming age may still be optimal because it provides income security if the claimant lives longer than expected and could provide a higher survivor benefit to a spouse. Conversely, for some, claiming later may maximize expected lifetime benefits, but claiming now might be optimal because it meets an urgent financial need that cannot be filled otherwise.&#8221; All four considerations—monthly benefits, lifetime benefits, longevity protection, and immediate needs—are important, but individuals and financial advisors often underappreciate Social Security’s insurance value in favor of focusing on maximizing estimated lifetime benefits. Partially because of this, the distribution of claiming ages skews younger, with many choosing a reduced monthly benefit, and the most common claiming age being the earliest eligibility age of 62. The distribution of claiming ages differs slightly between women and men, with women claiming slightly earlier, on average, than men—despite the fact that the average 62-year-old woman will live three years longer than the average 62-year-old man. But Social Security claiming behavior has changed significantly over time. In 1998, 60% of people claimed benefits at age 62, and nearly 80% claimed before reaching their full retirement age (FRA). By 2022, the proportion of people claiming at age 62 dropped by more than half, to 29%, and the proportion claiming before FRA fell to 61%. At the same time, the proportion of people claiming benefits after FRA more than doubled, from 9% in 1998 to 23% in 2022.",

    "content": "In an era defined by deep polarization, the groundbreaking Harris Poll commissioned by the Bipartisan Policy Center suggests a remarkable—and encouraging—degree of consensus among Americans when it comes to key issues in child welfare. As one would expect, the poll’s extensive data finds some distinct inclinations among various sub-groups, but the far more surprising news is the extent of shared values and common ground across Americans of all stripes. People of devout religious faith are no exception. While diverging here and there from their less religious neighbors, their opinions track closely with the broad consensus shared by most Americans. When differing, they reflect these consensus values with heightened passion and personal commitment. Religious Commitment and Personal Service Research consistently finds religious faith and practice to be highly connected to giving and service of all kinds, including child welfare. While under 40% of Americans attend church services weekly, 65% of foster parents do. Barna Research found that practicing Christians are twice as likely to foster or adopt than the general population. They are also more likely to welcome sibling groups, older youth, and children with special needs. Faith-motivated individuals support child welfare and other needs in an array of ways, including giving at significantly higher rates to both faith-based and non-religious charities. Faith communities also provide critical material, emotional, and spiritual support to adoptive, foster, kinship, and biological families. More than 40% of congregations offer some form of organized foster and/or adoption support, and many more provide some form of this help organically. Many churches provide extensive support to biological families who may have experience with child welfare as well, from material needs to childcare to addiction recovery communities and more. Indeed, in some parts of the U.S., the faith community may be the sole source of such supports to families. BPC’s Harris Poll confirmed this: People for whom religion plays a major role in life are nearly 50% more likely than those with minimal religious commitments to be familiar with the child welfare system. People rooted in deep faith play an indispensable role in child and family welfare, from foster parenting to volunteering as CASAs to supporting biological families. Their voices are critical in efforts toward bipartisan improvements in child welfare. Highly Religious Individuals Hold Views Similar to Most Americans, Only More So Overall, religious Americans, like most Americans, believe that parents bear the primary responsibility for children, but also affirm that the government can play an important, if limited, role in child welfare. For example, when asked about the tension between parental authority and government interest in child wellbeing, a solid majority of all Americans emphasize the role of parents over government. This includes those who are minimally religious (by a margin of 54% to 40%) and moderately religious (58% to 38%).  Those who are highly religious are even more committed to this shared value, at 62% to 33%. The polling data further bears out this general alignment of perspectives between religious individuals and the broader consensus of Americans&hellip;",

    "content": "Every morning, millions of children are welcomed into their classrooms by members of the child care workforce. Once parents wave goodbye, these directors, teachers, and teacher assistants spend countless hours caring for our youngest and most vulnerable. But who is qualified to care for our children? The answer depends on which state you live in. BPC scanned training and education requirements for staff working in a child care center in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The unfortunate reality is many states require little to no training for child care staff working in a licensed center and requirements vary greatly from state to state. To work in a child care center as a teacher: One state has no requirements (NV)   Eleven states require individuals to be a certain sixteen, unless otherwise noted (AK, ID, LA, MO-18, ND- 14, NM-18, IA, SD- 18, TN-18, UT, WY).  To work as a teacher assistant: Three states have no requirements (FL, MI, and NV). Twenty-one states require individuals to be 16, unless otherwise noted (AK, GA, ID, IA, LA, MA, MO-18, MS, NE, NM-18, NH, NC, ND-14, OR-15, KS, SD-14, TN-18, UT, VA, WI-18, WY). Many states barely exceed this threshold, requiring just a high school diploma to work as a teacher or teacher assistant. Licensing requirements are the minimum standards to work in a child care center, meaning centers can also employ a workforce with qualifications that far exceed the licensing requirements. The Child Care and Development Block Grant requires Lead Agencies to set baseline requirements for CPR, first aid, and safe sleep practices. More information on a state’s basic health and safety training requirements may be found in their CCDF State Plan. BPC’s Child Care Workforce Licensing Database only includes training and education requirements listed in child care center licensing regulations. Centers that participate in a state’s child care subsidy program or quality rating and improvement system typically have additional requirements, including basic health and safety training. However, states with no minimum requirements for teachers and teacher assistants run classrooms without specialized training or experience. On the other hand, some states do require preparation for teachers and teacher assistants to enter the classroom. In Mississippi, child care teachers must have a high school diploma, CDA, and three years of experience. In Illinois, teachers must have a high school diploma, 60 semester hours from an accredited college with six hours related directly to child care, one year of experience, and the completion of an approved credential program. To learn more about licensing requirements, see our recently released Child Care Workforce Licensing Database. Young children’s relationships with adults, especially child care staff with whom some spend 40 or more hours a week, can provide the foundation for an entire lifetime, no matter what state a child lives in. To build a system that parents want, we need to build trust. Creating a child care system that parents trust goes hand-in-hand with developing the competency and stability of the workforce.  BPC’s 11 parent&hellip;",

    "content": "In the aftermath of a major natural disaster, survivors may need assistance from FEMA, among other federal agencies, to secure housing and rebuild. However, onerous requirements and complicated application processes often make it harder for survivors to access that assistance. After a thorough review of its Individual Assistance (IA) program, FEMA recently proposed a package of major reforms designed to address these challenges, improve access, and better meet the needs of disaster survivors. The proposed changes, which are expected to go into effect for disasters declared in late March 2024, appear promising, targeting a handful of longstanding issues raised by survivors navigating disaster recoveries. See a summary of the proposed changes below: Conclusion After careful analysis of the Individual Assistance program and its major problems, based on the experience of survivors, FEMA’s proposed changes offer a positive path forward in making federal disaster assistance programs work better. Because our nation’s federal disaster response and recovery system involves numerous programs across agencies and levels of government, federal officials should follow FEMA’s lead to comprehensively review their disaster recovery programs. At the same, Congress should holistically review and advance the statutory changes necessary to simplify and improve the delivery of assistance to disaster-impacted communities and households.  ",

    "content": "On average, almost a third of parents considering using formal child care (care provided in a center or home-based care) cannot find a place for their child. This is a problem for parents and the economy: about 70% of children under six have working parents. Beyond losing the long-term child development benefits of quality early childhood programs, insufficient child care supply has serious consequences for gender equality, family incomes, poverty alleviation efforts, local economies, and spatial inequities: Rural and low-income areas face larger child care shortages than urban or higher-income neighborhoods. One study estimated that the U.S. economy loses $122 billion per year from the infant and toddler (0-3) child care supply shortage alone—estimated in lost parental earnings, business and tax revenues. Although it is generally agreed that public funding is needed to address the child care supply shortage, whether demand- or supply-side policies (or a combination of both) ought to be used is debated by early childhood education experts. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) is one demand-side policy which helps offset a portion of families’ child or dependent care expenses by reducing their federal or state income tax liabilities. This blog presents the findings of a new study that analyzed the association between state CDCTCs and the level of child care supply to address demand-side concerns. Demand-Side Child Care Policies In the formal child care market, providers expand supply (i.e. add child care slots) to meet the care needs of families (demand). (Note: Formal care is paid care provided by an individual, licensed center, or family-based provider, while informal care is provided by a child’s parents, relatives, friends, or neighbors.) One key challenge in modeling child care demand is the difference between potential and actual demand. For example, a low-income community with many single working parents may have high potential need for formal child care, but little financial capacity to acquire it. This population can be characterized as having “latent” demand. It should be noted that, because some parents will always prefer to use informal child care, some degree of a child care gap will exist. Child care decision-making is a dynamic and complex process filled with trade-offs and influenced by family ideology, employment status, income, and race/ethnic background. That said, latent demand contributes to the size of the current child care supply gap. BPC found in a 2022 survey of parents using informal care that approximately 40% were doing so because they found formal care inaccessible, particularly with regard to cost. This suggests that the equilibrium at which the child care market currently clears is not where it would clear for low-income families: Formal care would be in higher demand if child care was cheaper or if families had a greater ability to pay. However, due to the unique constraints of operating a child care business, providers cannot further lower prices (they are already under-charging for the true cost of delivering care). Income, therefore, influences formal child care consumption and, by extension, drives supply. According&hellip;",

    "content": "The U.S. fiscal house stands on shaky ground. Marked by a federal debt that has eclipsed $34 trillion, growing annual deficits, persistent inflation, and rising interest rates, Americans are increasingly frustrated by both these risks and Washington’s gridlock over how to address them. Lawmakers no longer have the luxury of focusing on just one side of the fiscal equation: we cannot continue to deficit finance our way through changing economic conditions. Revenue generated by the federal tax code is a critical part of the ledger. The federal government collects revenue from a variety of sources, including individual income taxes, payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare, excise taxes, corporate income taxes, among other fees. As taxes will be on most Americans’ minds throughout the 2024 filing season, there is an opportunity to increase public awareness and understanding of the revenue side of the ledger, starting with helping Americans better understand where their tax dollars go. Paying Taxes: It’s Complicated Americans have a complicated relationship with the tax system. In a 2023 Gallup poll, over half of taxpayers (51%) felt that the amount they paid in federal income taxes was not fair, the highest it’s been since the poll’s inception. Moreover, the findings suggest that Americans are more critical of federal income taxes, with most (34%) perceiving it as the least fair tax compared to federal Social Security tax (payroll tax), state income and sales tax, and local property taxes. Not only do Americans think what they pay in taxes is unfair, they also have strong opinions on how tax dollars should be spent. A 2020 GoBankingRates survey found that more than half (56%) believe their tax dollars are not being spent effectively, with a majority saying they would prefer more of their tax dollars be prioritized for Social Security and Medicare. When it comes to spending tax dollars on other public assistance programs, which encompassed 11.8% of government spending pre-pandemic, opinions were split: 27% of respondents felt that spending was about right, 35% felt it was too much, and 39% felt it was not enough. Meanwhile, over a quarter (27%) of respondents did not know how their tax dollars were being spent. The data demonstrates that the gap between what Americans know, or think they know, can be pretty off-base from reality. A previous poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most Americans overestimate how much of the federal budget goes toward social programs and international aid. However, with more information, perceptions changed: Once people learned how much the government spent on different public initiatives, their opinions about what was too much or too little also changed. Improving public awareness is thus key to building a more engaged, informed citizenry. Educating the Public Using the Federal Taxpayer Receipt The Bipartisan Policy Center partnered with Intuit and Polco to launch the Federal Taxpayer Receipt to help Americans better understand exactly where their federal taxes go.

    "content": "The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently finalized groundbreaking transparency requirements for artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive algorithms. Although it has notable limitations, the rule aims to demystify the complexities of certain AI tools in health care. The Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing (HTI-1) final rule is the first federal regulation to set specific reporting requirements for developers of AI tools and might set the stage for future government action. ONC could take this landmark step because health care is different from other sectors that use AI in at least three important ways: Health care operates under existing privacy frameworks: The health care industry’s regulated nature has laid the groundwork for additional AI rules. Unlike many other industries, health care already operates under a federal privacy standard set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This existing framework provides a strong foundation for AI regulation in health care, despite HIPAA potentially requiring updates to fully address AI-related issues. HHS has technical expertise: HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act positioned individuals in HHS with expertise in emerging technologies, including AI. Regulatory developments are spurring ONC action: The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has also begun to address AI liability as part of its nondiscrimination proposed rule. If OCR finalizes its rule as proposed, providers—rather than AI developers—will likely be liable for AI-related actions. As such, it is crucial for providers to have information about the AI tools they use. Background The ONC final rule implements provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) and updates ONC’s Health Information Technology (Health IT) Certification Program. The certification program is a voluntary initiative that certifies health IT products—including electronic health records—that meet standards for data exchange, privacy, and security. Through the HITECH Act, Congress requires certain providers participating in Medicare and Medicaid to utilize certified health IT. Transparency Requirements for Health Care AI The final rule establishes transparency requirements for predictive decision support interventions (DSIs) that are part of certified health IT. The rule adopts strategies from a toolbox of options to enhance transparency in AI development and deployment. Transparency in AI development: The final rule requires developers of certified health IT to conduct risk management for all predictive DSIs in their health IT modules. Developers must describe their data governance procedures—including how data are acquired, managed, and used—and evaluate and mitigate risks related to accuracy, bias, and safety. In addition, developers of certified health IT must submit summary information on their intervention risk management practices to a publicly accessible ONC site. Many commenters on the proposed rule expressed concerns about exposing trade secrets or proprietary information. In response, ONC emphasized the importance of transparency and stated they do not see new risks related to proprietary information.

    "content": "This piece was updated on April 29, 2025, to reflect the bill’s reintroduction in the 119th Congress. The bill was originally introduced in 2024, On February 5, 2025, Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Angus King (I-ME) alongside Reps. Stephanie Bice (R-OK), Randy Feenstra (R-IA), and Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) reintroduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to reform the 45S Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave (45S) that would make the credit more durable and help businesses provide paid leave benefits to more workers. Originally enacted in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the bipartisan 45S tax credit was the first federal policy to support paid family and medical leave in the United States. Amid an ever-changing economy and tight labor market, paid family and medical leave can importantly encourage workers to stay in the labor force, support household finances, and help businesses compete for workers. A 2023 BPC-Artemis poll found that many prime-age adults (defined here as those aged 20-54 who are not full-time students) are not currently in the workforce due to caregiving responsibilities, especially women. Moreover, when compared to a wide range of potential workplace benefits, prime-age adults who are not in the labor force say that paid family and medical leave is about as important as compensation when considering starting or returning to the workforce. As momentum grows to find innovative federal and state solutions to offer paid family and medical leave, enhancing the 45S tax credit is a critical next step to expand access to employer-provided paid family leave benefits. Enhancing the 45S tax credit by making it permanent, allowing employers to apply it toward insurance premiums, and expanding the base of eligible workers could further help more employers provide paid leave to hardworking American families. Key provisions in the bill, which parallels many of BPC’s past recommendations include: &nbsp; Making the tax credit permanent. The 45S tax credit was initially enacted as a two-year pilot program through 2019 and subsequently extended twice on a temporary basis. To maximize the tax credit’s effectiveness, employers need confidence that the tax credit will be available to them for years to come. Making the tax credit permanent provides employers with certainty about its future and further incentivizes them to use it to provide or expand paid leave benefits. Covering leave mandated by state and local government. Currently, 13 states, the District of Columbia, and several other cities and counties, have established mandatory paid family leave programs. Despite being required to participate in these programs, employers in those places are currently unable to claim the credit to offset some of their costs. Moreover, employers who operate and provide leave in both mandated and non-mandated states are ineligible to claim the tax credit, which disincentivizes providing equitable access to leave benefits for all workers. Changes proposed in this bill would rectify this issue, allowing businesses to claim the credit for leave provided in non-mandated states, along with leave provided over and above what is mandated by state and local programs.

    "content": "The leaders of Congress’ tax-writing committees, House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) and Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR), recently announced the first major bipartisan tax agreement since 2020. Among other reforms, the deal would make significant changes to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for 2023-2025. One proposed change in particular—allowing parents to use previous year income for determining their CTC amount if it is greater than their current-year income—has caused concern among some lawmakers and commenters, including the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal. While the provision contains work incentives and disincentives, the editorial cites a new paper from American Enterprise Institute (AEI) scholars that claims that “over 700,000 parents” could stop working as a result of the proposed rule. This estimate, however, requires context. First, the determination that 700,000 parents would leave the workforce is over two years, not one, and is a gross figure, not net. When accounting for parents who would be pulled into the workforce, the net job loss estimate is around 150,000 per year—far lower than 700,000. Second, the methodology is an outlier among peer research. Last September, BPC released a paper comparing several studies of the employment effects of a permanent expansion of the CTC, similar to that enacted temporarily in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. While we found that such an expansion would lead to modest job loss—validating some policymakers’ concerns that, if made permanent, the policy would disincentivize work—one study in particular was an outlier: a 2021 estimate from two of the same AEI researchers that 1.5 million parents would exit the workforce, double the next largest estimate for job loss. The authors projected a much higher elasticity (a much larger negative effect on workforce participation) than their peers for low-income single mothers. This methodological outlier is repeated in their paper on the proposed CTC income lookback, with the authors estimating triple the responsiveness of low-income single mothers to changes in tax policy compared to other scholars. Finally, the change must also be measured against other changes to the CTC proposed in the deal that would increase work incentives for many households, such as the enhanced phase-in for parents with multiple children and the increased refundability of the credit. Increasing the phase-in for the CTC and enhancing its refundability are two ways to increase work incentives for taxpayers subject to the phase-in, especially those lower on the income ladder. The Wyden-Smith deal does both. Regardless of the work incentives and disincentives generated by these potential changes to the CTC, the proposal must be evaluated for its complexity and for its temporary nature, as raised by experts at the Tax Foundation and by AEI’s Kyle Pomerleau. It must also be evaluated against the realities facing working parents; it strains imagination that hundreds of thousands of parents could or would effectively game the system—choosing to forego jobs paying tens of thousands of dollars per year—just to receive a few extra thousand dollars of CTC.

    "content": "There is widespread concern (amongst those in the field, those who study the issue, those who advocate…) that the historically bipartisan nature of child welfare policymaking has been negatively affected by political polarization. Learning how different groups of society see the role of the child welfare system will allow policymakers and advocates to respond to public sentiment in this space and build on consensus where it can be found. This blog examines how political differences between Republicans and Democrats shape the public’s view of the child welfare system. As we look at the polling data, a few general observations: Broad bipartisan consensus on most aspects of the child welfare system: Polling shows few differences between how Republicans and Democrats think about the causes of child abuse and the ways that the child welfare system should respond. However, areas with significant public consensus may not be aligned with the views of system leaders. Small but meaningful differentiation on who is at fault when child abuse occurs: While not large, there are meaningful differences on questions surrounding who is at fault when child abuse occurs. Republicans generally are more likely to say that child abuse is the parents’ fault. Small but meaningful differences in the child welfare system’s purpose: Democrats are more likely to say that the child welfare system should strengthen families, whereas Republicans believe that the child welfare system should prioritize protecting children. Why Child Neglect and Abuse Occur Republicans and Democrats both believe that the most significant causes of child abuse are the ill-intent or desire of parents to harm their children; parents who use drugs or alcohol; generational trauma or patterns; and untreated mental health issues. Democrats and Republicans are less likely to believe that material hardship—such as lack of financial resources, lack of access to child care, or lack of access to affordable housing—are reasons why child abuse occurs. Questions on why child neglect occurs shows a similar pattern of agreement but provides different causes. Americans continue to believe that drug or alcohol abuse is an important factor in child neglect. Yet they are more likely to also believe that some parents are uninterested in caring for their children or that there is a lack of financial resources or knowledge in parenting by families where child neglect occurs. The consensus here is striking, not only because there is a strong level of agreement, but also because this view is at odds with what many child welfare leaders believe. While many public agencies and nonprofits have suggested in recent years that more material supports for struggling families could reduce investigations into families and removals to foster care, across the political spectrum the public seems to see causes other than poverty as the main drivers of child maltreatment. The public’s focus on the influence of substance abuse and mental illness suggests that child welfare leaders and policymakers may want to pay closer attention to the connection between these factors and involvement with the child welfare system.  It is important&hellip;",

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background Montana has a rapidly growing population, due in large part to an increase in migration from places with higher costs of living, especially the West Coast. Although Montana has long been a destination for wealthy retirees and vacation home buyers, migration to the state surged during the pandemic, driven by the increased ability to relocate and work remotely. The state has seen skyrocketing housing prices as a result. Between 2010 and 2020, Montana’s population increased by nearly 10%, and despite an increase in homebuilding, housing supply struggled to keep up, only increasing by 7%. During the pandemic, from 2020 to 2023, the state’s population is estimated to have increased by another 4.5%, or about 50,000 people. Yet only 19,000 new homes were built in that time. According to Zillow, the median home value in Montana jumped by over 60% over the course of four years, starting at $274,000 in 2019 and reaching $446,000 by 2023. Reforms Implemented In 2022, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte issued an executive order establishing a housing task force of diverse stakeholders to develop recommendations for addressing the housing affordability problems facing the state. The task force included Republicans and Democrats from the state legislature, as well as representatives from state agencies, businesses and industry groups, nonprofits, academia, and local communities. The task force put out two reports in 2022 and, in 2023, the state passed a series of laws based on many of the task force’s recommendations. Those laws focused on allowing for increased density in existing towns and cities to prevent sprawl and preserve Montana’s natural beauty. Bill Description Date Implemented House Bill 211 Streamlines the subdivision review and approval process, which divides land so that it can be developed for housing. Applies to subdivision applications approved on or after October 1, 2023 Senate Bill 245 Allows multifamily residential and mixed-use buildings to be built in areas zoned for commercial use. Passed May 17, 2023; effective upon passage House Bill 246 Allows cities and towns to create zones that allow tiny homes. Passed April 19, 2023; effective upon passage Senate Bill 323 Allows duplexes to be built wherever single-family homes can be built (only applies for municipalities with more than 5,000 residents). Intended to be effective January 1, 2024, but temporarily on hold Senate Bill 382 Requires municipalities that meet population minimums to create land use plans that detail how they will meet long-term housing needs. Requires cities to implement at least five regulatory changes that would increase housing supply from a list of 14 suggested changes. Accelerates the opportunity for public comment on planning decisions so that it occurs earlier in the process. Passed May 17, 2023; effective upon passage Senate Bill 407 Eliminates design review by external boards.

    "content": "On January 16, the chairmen of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees unveiled a $78 billion tax policy package known as the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024. The package includes two important housing provisions originally proposed in the bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act, which are aimed at strengthening the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). Here are a few things to keep in mind about LIHTC and the reforms included in the tax package. LIHTC is the main federal tool for financing the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental homes. Since its creation in 1986, LIHTC has helped finance approximately 3.7 million rental homes serving approximately 8 million households. According to the most recent data provided by HUD, the median income of households in LIHTC-assisted units was $18,600 in 2021. Here’s how it works: The federal government provides housing credits to states based on their population. State and local LIHTC-allocating agencies provide these credits to developers competitively, evaluating proposed projects using scoring criteria they outline in Qualified Allocation Plans or QAPs. Developers then sell these tax credits to outside investors, gaining equity for their projects. As a trade-off for reducing their financing costs, the government requires developers to maintain affordable rents in a percentage of their units for a certain amount of time. There are two kinds of housing credits: the 9% and 4% LIHTCs. The 9% LIHTC provides a greater tax credit subsidy, making it more valuable, and is typically used for new construction without additional federal subsidies. In contrast, the 4% LIHTC has a lower subsidy rate and is paired with tax-exempt private activity bonds (PABs), requiring developers to finance a portion of their project with these bonds to access the credits. The tax deal would increase the amount of housing credits that states can allocate. States receive annual allocations for their 9% LIHTCs based on a per-capita formula. In 2018, Congress passed a 12.5% increase over this base allocation, in effect providing more credits for states to fund affordable housing developments. While this initial increase expired in 2021, the proposed tax package would restore it retroactively for 2023 and extend it through 2025. This increase can help address the growing gap between the supply of housing credits and developer demand for them: In 2020, developers requested nearly 2.5 times the amount of housing credits that were available to states. Additionally, expanded credit allocations can contribute to offsetting the increasing expense of building LIHTC housing. The proposed reduction in the private activity bond minimum threshold needed to use 4% LIHTCs would allow states to fund more affordable housing. PABs are a federally-funded debt financing tool that states can issue for a variety of purposes—including subsidizing affordable housing construction. Developers interested in gaining access to the 4% LIHTC—and avoiding the competitive process involved in acquiring the more lucrative 9% LIHTC—can automatically qualify to receive the credit if they finance a minimum of 50% of their aggregate basis (the combined cost of building and&hellip;",

    "content": "This blog post is the second in a series highlighting local approaches to improve housing choice for low-income families, incentivize family self-sufficiency, and achieve greater cost effectiveness in HUD spending through the Moving to Work demonstration program. Research shows that housing choice vouchers (HCVs) can reduce homelessness, improve housing stability, and reduce overcrowded conditions for low-income families. However, only 60% of families who receive vouchers are ultimately able to use them to lease units. Voucher recipients face numerous hurdles when looking for and leasing rental housing, including competition from households that can pay market rents without subsidies, landlords who are hesitant to deal with administrative processes required by public housing authorities (PHAs), and misconceptions about voucher holders. This blog features strategies that four Moving to Work (MTW) PHAs—Atlanta Housing Authority (AH), Louisville Metro Housing Authority (LMHA), Oakland Housing Authority (OHA), and San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC)—have implemented to directly respond to these common barriers and expand housing choice. Common Barriers &amp; Housing Authority Solutions to Boost Housing Choice Barrier #1: Landlords, especially those in high opportunity neighborhoods, have many options to fill their units. Housing vouchers uniquely enable low-income households to live in communities they may not otherwise be able to afford, offering them a chance to move out of higher-poverty and less-resourced neighborhoods if they so choose. Despite their importance to the success of the HV program, landlords have participated in fewer and fewer numbers in recent years, as HUD and others in the industry have documented. Solution: Landlord incentives MTW housing authorities draw on flexible funding to make voucher families more competitive applicants in their unique rental markets. For instance, in response to a limited supply of available one-bedroom units in the Louisville area, LMHA offers a special incentive to landlords who lease this housing type to their voucher holders. To test and evaluate landlord incentives, HUD selected 29 PHAs to join the MTW program as a cohort focused on these strategies. While it is too early to report on any findings from the cohort, the PHAs highlighted below were able to report increases in housing choice because of their landlord incentives. Barrier #2: The inspection process lengthens lease-up timelines, and owners incur the costs of repairs. More than half of landlords surveyed in HUD’s landlord participation study cited inspection issues as motivation for not participating in the HCV program. The process of scheduling an inspection can take days or even weeks, and failed inspections add more days to the lease-up timeline. Last year, HUD completed a comprehensive overhaul of its inspection protocol, and the resulting National Standards for the Inspection of Real Estate rule replaced Housing Quality Standards as the framework to determine housing quality. One of HUD’s goals for the overhaul was to address landlord concerns about the consistency of inspections, but challenges remain. Solution: Flexible inspection timing and incentives for compliance MTW PHAs have developed their own strategies in response to critiques about the inspection process, with the aim to boost landlord participation and thus&hellip;",

Campus Happenings &#8216;Fear Rather Than Sensitivity&#8217;: Most U.S. Scholars on the Mideast Are Self-Censoring Manuela López Restrepo | NPR | December 15, 2023 As colleges and universities respond to a surge of antisemitism on campuses, U.S.-based scholars on the Middle East are increasingly self-censoring, according to a survey of over 900 scholars conducted by the University of Maryland and George Washington University. The Middle East Scholar Barometer survey found that 82% of respondents self-censor when addressing Israel-Palestine issues due to perceived pressures from students, administrators, and external advocacy groups. Harvard President Claudine Gay Resigns Amid Plagiarism Claims, Backlash from Antisemitism Testimony Steve LeBlanc and Collin Binkley | Associated Press | January 2, 2024 Claudine Gay announced her resignation as president of Harvard University on January 2. Gay faced considerable pressure, especially from conservative donors, activists, and lawmakers to step down in the wake of her controversial congressional testimony and investigations that revealed dozens of instances of plagiarism. Gay released a statement and defended herself in an essay in the New York Times. She will return to her faculty post after serving just six months as the university’s president. State and Federal Diversity Offices on College Campuses Will Soon Be Illegal in Texas, as 30 New Laws Go into Effect Ayden Runnels | Texas Tribune | December 28, 2023 Texas Senate Bill 17, which went into effect on January 1, “requires public universities to end so-called diversity, equity and inclusion work.” The new law shutters DEI offices and prohibits universities from offering DEI training or requiring diversity statements during hiring. Many public institutions in Texas have preemptively shrunk their DEI offices and are closing some student support programs due to concerns that they may not comply with the new law. The Censors’ Next Target Jeffrey Adam Sachs and Jeremy C. Young | Inside Higher Ed | January 10, 2024 PEN America researchers Jeffrey Sachs and Jeremy Young assess the recent efforts by state lawmakers to advance educational censorship bills.

Kevin Wallsten | Heterodox Academy | December 6, 2023 Political science professor Kevin Wallsten dives into the data to answer the question posed by the essay title.

    "content": "Last year, as companies launched their generative AI for widespread public use, several individual content producers and media companies took legal action to protect their creative works from misuse. Central to these debates are ethical and legal implications of training these large generative AI models and policies that govern the intricate interplays of AI, data privacy, and copyright. Several legal challenges illuminate questions concerning the unauthorized use of personal data in AI model training, where few protections exist. Others raise concerns about the copyrights and reputation of individuals in creative industries, including the application of the “fair use” doctrine—allowing specific uses of copyrighted works for education, news reporting, research, and other areas. The core issue in these legal challenges lies in the data used to train generative AI models. In general, more data for training or fine-tuning improves a model’s efficiency, precision, or generalization. However, using methods like web scrapping, which involves automated extraction of vast volumes of content from websites and online databases, introduces complex issues around privacy, licensing, and transparency. These techniques raise legal and ethical considerations about the legitimacy of obtaining the training information in the first place and about the application of these systems’ outputs. As courts exercise their authority, the role of regulators and policymakers in governing the intersection of AI, privacy, and copyright needs exploration. Three Legal Challenges 1) Most recently, a lawsuit filed by the New York Times accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of widespread copyright infringement and competition concerns. At its core, the lawsuit asserts that both companies used millions of published news articles by The Times to train their large language models (LLMs), powering generative AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot. In response, OpenAI wrote that the New York Times is not a significant source of information in its training data and that it aims to prevent “regurgitation” of content. OpenAI also noted it is helping news organizations “elevate their ability to produce quality journalism by realizing the transformative potential of AI.” Some of the policy and legal questions this lawsuit raises include:  2) A proposed class action lawsuit filed in July 2023 alleged Google misused personal and private information to train its AI system. The plaintiffs, including authors, artists, journalists, and others, argue Google used their data without “notice, consent, or fair compensation.” Google updated its privacy policies in early July to specify that it may “use publicly available information” to train its AI models and tools, such as Google’s new chatbot Bard, and used this as its defense in court, asserting that even the plaintiffs recognize the training data that was used was “public.” In Google’s motion to dismiss states the lawsuit “would take a sledgehammer not just to Google’s services but to the very idea of generative AI.” Similar lawsuits have also been filed against OpenAI and Microsoft, raising parallel concerns. Some of the policy and legal questions these lawsuits raise include: 3) Another proposed class-action lawsuit filed by three artists in U.S. federal court in&hellip;",

    "content": "This blog is informed by BPC’s participation in a December delegation to Maui organized by After the Fire, a non-profit organization created by wildfire survivors and experts to support communities as they prepare for wildfires and recover, rebuild, and reimagine a more resilient future after a wildfire. Five months after the devastating Maui wildfires, disaster response efforts are still working to address the urgent needs of survivors. The island has a long road ahead before it fully recovers, with significant housing, infrastructure, and economic challenges. This blog outlines five key takeaways federal policymakers should know about Maui’s recovery efforts. 1. Survivors still need stable housing while Lahaina rebuilds. As of December 15, about 6,000 survivors were living in hotels, a number FEMA says is dynamic and changes daily. Due to the shortage of available homes, finding stable, medium-term housing for survivors to transition into after they move out of hotels is a pressing challenge, as Lahaina could take years to rebuild its housing stock. According to the American Red Cross, the average cost to house a family through the Non-Congregate Sheltering program on Maui is approximately $1,000/day (including meals and administrative costs). Some survivors staying in hotels have had to relocate multiple times, adding to their turmoil and making it difficult to get back on their feet. Only a very small number of survivors have been able to utilize FEMA’s rental assistance to secure long-term housing because of the lack of available rental units. Meanwhile, some survivors relocated out of Hawai&#8217;i in their search for housing. One potential source of housing for survivors is short-term rentals (STRs). There are more than 12,000 STRs on Maui, by one estimate, though as of late November only a few hundred were staying in STRs. In December, FEMA issued a press release offering to pay “fair and stable” compensation to STR operators housing survivors, and is working to secure more long-term rental housing options for survivors currently in hotels to move into. The Maui County Council has also considered tax incentives for STR operators to house survivors and a moratorium on STRs. However, concerns remain about whether STR operators will be persuaded to house survivors and the proposed moratorium could face legal challenges. Promisingly, the state of Hawai&#8217;i, county of Maui, and a group of philanthropic organizations recently partnered to announce a $500 million plan to provide stable housing for a few thousand households, with 18-month commitments for each household by July 24, 2024. 2. Maui faces a broader long-term housing crisis. Even before the fire, Maui faced a severe housing crisis. Maui needs to rebuild its lost housing stock and dramatically expand its supply of affordable housing. Hawai&#8217;i has the highest median home value in the nation, as well as the fourth highest level of homelessness. Since 2000, Maui has experienced over 300% price growth in homes. Many locals working service jobs, particularly in the tourism industry, do not make incomes that can meet such high housing costs. In Maui County, more than&hellip;",

Here are a few things to know about it: A Long Overdue Correction to the Tax Treatment of R&amp;D: The agreement restores full and immediate expensing for businesses’ research and development expenditures, undoing the five-year amortization requirement that took effect in 2022. It also makes R&amp;D expensing retroactive to investments made from 2022 through 2025. These changes incentivize business investments that enhance productivity and grow the economy. Read more about the importance of R&amp;D expensing here. Child Tax Credit Expansions That Support Low-Income Families and Retain Work Incentives: The deal makes important, targeted expansions to the CTC by enhancing its refundability—the portion of the credit available to parents even when they have no federal tax liability. This should help low- and middle-income working parents. It also retains work incentives, such as the earned-income phase-in. Read more about the difference between refundability and earnings/work requirements here and what’s included in the deal here. Bipartisan Expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC): The agreement increases LIHTC allocations available to states and reduces the amount of bond financing needed to access credits, two of BPC’s long-standing recommendations to strengthen the credit and increase the supply of rental homes affordable to low-income families. These policies are an important first step in responding to America’s housing affordability crisis. Includes Responsible Offsets: It is encouraging to see lawmakers offer a substantial offset: extending the statute of limitations for the IRS to pursue fraudulent or erroneous claims of the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) and prohibiting new claims after January 2024. Although the credit helped business owners weather the pandemic, it has been subject to fraudulent claims due to aggressive marketing. As lawmakers look to the trillions of dollars in tax cut expirations next year, they must put fiscal responsibility front and center. Read more about the interaction between tax and fiscal policy here. First Major Bipartisan Tax Deal Since December 2020: Since late 2021, lawmakers have attempted several times to expand the CTC and address business tax expirations from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

    "content": "For the first time since 2021, lawmakers are seriously considering modifications to the Child Tax Credit (CTC). Here are a few things to keep in mind about the CTC from BPC’s Economic Policy Program: The deal makes changes to the refundability of the credit and the phase-in for the credit—these are distinct changes. “Full refundability” means the full credit is available to parents regardless of federal income tax liability. The elimination of the CTC’s earnings threshold would mean the full credit would be available to parents regardless of earnings, but this agreement does not eliminate the earnings threshold. (More on the difference here.) This agreement brings the CTC from 85% refundability ($1,700 per child) under current law to full refundability by 2025. Additionally, the CTC would still phase in beginning at the earnings threshold of $2,500, but it would do so simultaneously for multiple children in a family (rather than one child at a time under current law). The changes will have the greatest impact on families living below the federal poverty level. These changes are designed to retain earnings requirements in the CTC while expanding the credit for low-income families, especially those with multiple children. For example, a family of four earning $20,000 in 2023 (67% of the federal poverty level) and taking the standard deduction during this tax season would receive $3,600 in CTC instead of $2,625. The changes should not have a significant effect on work/employment in the economy. BPC recently assessed five academic studies that attempted to measure the work/employment effects of a permanent American Rescue Plan (ARP) CTC. The academic consensus is that an expanded CTC with no earnings phase-in would lead to a modest decline in employment alongside reductions in poverty. Given that the recently revealed bipartisan agreement maintains earnings requirements and phase-ins for the CTC, and actually enhances the incentive to work for some parents, we do not anticipate the CTC changes will have significant effects on work/employment. The changes should not have a meaningful impact on inflation. The deal reportedly provides around $35 billion in CTC expansions over three years, roughly $12 billion per year on average. In a $19 trillion per year consumer economy, these modest changes to the CTC are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on inflation.",

    "content": "Election Day marks the final day on which voters can cast a ballot in the 2024 election. But the electoral system for choosing and inaugurating our president extends well beyond November 5. Notably, the Electoral Count Reform Act, enacted in late 2022, updated certain dates and procedures in the electoral vote counting process that will be in effect for the first time in the 2024 election. Election Day: Tuesday, November 5, 2024 This is the final day on which votes can be cast in the 2024 election. In many states, opportunities to cast ballots will have begun days or weeks ahead of Election Day. Even in states where mail-in ballots can be received after Election Day, such as California, they must have been cast and postmarked by Election Day. The election serves as the appointment of electors of president and vice president and must take place in accordance with the laws of the state enacted prior to Election Day. Once the polls close, election officials complete the process of counting the votes and certifying the results, which takes place in the subsequent days or weeks depending on state law Certificate of Ascertainment of Appointment of Electors Issued: no later than December 11, 2024 Every presidential election year, the executive of each state issues a certificate of ascertainment, which names and appoints the individuals who will cast the state’s electoral votes for president and vice president. The certificates are treated as conclusive in Congress with respect to the determination of electors appointed, except in the event of judicial relief described below. Certificates include: the names of the electors; the state’s certified election results (also known as the “canvass”) or, in some cases, another determination under the laws of the state of the number of votes given or cast for each person considered for elector; the seal of the State; and at least one security feature, set by the state, for purposes of verifying the authenticity of the certificate. The executive of each state transmits the certificates to the Archivist of the United States immediately after their issuance “by the most expeditious method available.” Provisions enacted in 2022 establish a legal venue and expedited judicial procedures in the event an aggrieved candidate for president or vice president challenges the certificates issued by a state’s executive. In the event the judicial process finds, prior to the date of the meeting of electors, that a  certificate of ascertainment must be issued or revised, that certificate shall replace and supersede any other submitted certificates. Meeting and Vote of Electors in their States: Tuesday, December 17, 2024 The electors meet in their respective states on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December (which, in 2024, is December 17) to cast their votes for president and vice president. The meeting of electors in each state is governed by state law enacted prior to Election Day. Electors sign multiple certificates attesting to the votes they have given, sign and endorse the certificates, and transmit them to officials in Washington, DC,&hellip;",

    "content": "Last month, two lawmakers who happen to also be hockey fanatics joined BPC&#8217;s American Congressional Exchange for a trip to Chicago to find common ground off the ice. Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois and Republican Rep. Pete Stauber hail from very different places—the nation’s third largest city and largely rural northern Minnesota—yet share similar histories. Both lead the Congressional Hockey Caucus. Stauber played the game professionally, while Quigley is still an avid “beer league” player “with over 300 stitches to prove it.” After serving as a police officer and area commander for 22 years in his hometown of Duluth, Stauber was a county commissioner before being elected to Congress in 2018. Quigley, a lawyer, also served as a county commissioner prior to his 2009 election to his congressional seat. With Stauber serving on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and Quigley on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, their trip focused on transportation and housing. Stauber’s visit started with a ride on Metra, the commuter railroad for the Chicago area, and the fourth busiest in the U.S. Travelling with the engineer in the giant locomotive’s cab, which is high-tech enough to pass for an aircraft cockpit, they learned about a federally mandated computerized system to prevent collisions and derailments and discussed federal funding opportunities for rail improvements. A short drive from where the train ride ended brought Stauber and Quigley to the Little Italy neighborhood to tour a unique real estate development combining a public library with 73 apartments, 40% of which are affordable units. The urgency of affordable housing and neighborhood revitalization is a key focus in Chicago—and for BPC’s J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing. The lawmakers heard firsthand from officials from a range of organizations that public housing projects are being demolished or rehabilitated with new designs that take a comprehensive approach. The effort stems, in part, from a series of court remedies to end the concentration of public housing units in predominately Black neighborhoods, which had limited public housing residents from accessing neighborhoods of opportunity. Gathering with an array of public, private, and nonprofit affordable housing leaders, Stauber and Quigley learned how federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits have been essential in generating the equity to support these revitalization efforts and the construction of affordable apartments. Duluth has used some of the same federal programs to great success. Stauber exclaimed he learned things he hadn’t known, and the two members found a common interest in additional conversations about housing policy and affordability when they returned to Washington. From there it was off to Chicago’s United Center arena, where Quigley and Stauber spent time with members of the Chicago Police and Fire Department hockey teams following their charity match—an especially meaningful visit for Stauber given his years on the force. In their capacity leading the Hockey Caucus, a forum for hockey&#8217;s cultural, social, and economic significance, the Republican and Democrat exchanged ideas with Chicago Blackhawks team owner Danny Wirtz about the team and the game’s&hellip;",

    "content": "The disappearance of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin brings to mind other instances of senior officials going AWOL: In March 2004, Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized, leaving deputy attorney general James Comey in charge. Comey was poised to rule against the White House on the legality of a post-9/11 surveillance program, so White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales went to George Washington Hospital to get Ashcroft to overrule Comey. Comey, however, got wind of it and went to the hospital to prevent it from happening. In 1965, during the Watts riots, Lyndon Johnson was unavailable as domestic policy advisor Joe Califano desperately tried to reach him from Washington. Califano later noted that it was the only time that he found the telephone-obsessed Johnson unreachable. On July 1, 1893, President Grover Cleveland had secret surgery to remove a tumor from his mouth. The White House never informed the press about the surgery, and Cleveland went on a boat for the surgery to maintain the secret. In September 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower had a heart attack while on vacation in Colorado. He stayed in the hospital for seven weeks while he recovered. The Austin incident as well as these other historical events are reminiscent of Phil Silvers&#8217; famous joke at the 1954 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Silvers looked at the assembled dignitaries and said, “My goodness, who’s minding the store?” The audience erupted in laughter and a CBS executive in the audience thought Silvers was so funny that he offered him a TV show afterwards.",

    "content": "The first year of the 118th Congress may not have included any big legislative achievements for small businesses, but it did include a lot of legislative activity aimed at strengthening federal support for America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs—including more than 30 small business committee hearings. As the new year begins, let’s look back at two important small business developments from 2023 and ahead to what will undoubtedly be a consequential next 12 months. SBA Modernization Gains Steam Congress has made many meaningful improvements to small business lending, technical assistance, and other programs over the years, but it hasn’t passed a comprehensive Small Business Administration (SBA) reauthorization bill since Bill Clinton was president. While 2023 began with hopes that the reauthorization drought would end, SBA modernization appeared in jeopardy last spring when bipartisan opposition emerged against SBA rulemaking. In keeping with longstanding bipartisan cooperation on small business issues, former Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee Chairman Ben Cardin, along with the committee’s ranking member, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), guided legislation through a committee markup that reopened the door to SBA reauthorization by rolling back and revising some of the changes SBA was pursuing through the rulemaking process. After the 18-1 vote in favor of S. 2482, the Community Advantage Loan Program Act, Sen. Cardin called the committee’s actions “historic” and said they “reflect the bipartisan spirit of our committee and our goal to remain laser-focused on codifying, modernizing and streamlining SBA programs.” Last year, the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee passed 10 additional bills, while the House Small Business Committee advanced 14 for further consideration. Although none of these bills has yet to make it through the legislative process, 11 have cleared the House; all comprise important components of what could become a comprehensive and bipartisan SBA modernization bill in 2024. Small Business Contracting Reforms Hitch Ride on NDAA As 2023 ended, Congress passed the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Embedded within this extensive must-pass bill were several reforms pertaining to small business contracting, including the elimination of self-certification for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) and an increase to the government-wide procurement goal for SDVOSBs from 3% to 5%. The latter provision mirrored the bipartisan and bicameral Investing in VETS Act (S. 2146 and H.R. 5147). While increasing small business procurement goals can help more small businesses win contracts with the federal government, setting higher goals alone is insufficient. Fewer small businesses are providing products and services to the federal government today compared to just 10 to 15 years ago, despite the government meeting its 23% small business prime contracting goal for the past 10 years. To further bolster small business contracting, the 2024 NDAA directed the Defense Department—the government’s largest purchaser of goods and services—to factor in the past performance of small businesses’ affiliate companies when evaluating bids. Doing so should help more small businesses establish a past performance track record, thereby improving their chances of winning government contracts.

    "content": "In recent years, taxpayer audits by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have gained renewed attention due to funding and policy changes at the agency. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocated an additional $80 billion to the agency, partially for initiatives aimed at reducing the estimated $688 billion annual tax gap. Yet, how the IRS determines which taxpayers to audit and conducts those audits has implications for fairness and equity in tax enforcement. While part of the IRS’s mission is to enforce the law with “integrity and fairness to all,” the unintended consequences of pursuing efficiency—primarily through focusing on simpler, electronic audits—can have an outsized impact on low-income tax filers. This has historically resulted in the agency disproportionately auditing claimants of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a tax credit designed to support low- and moderate-income workers by incentivizing workforce participation. These audits have significantly impacted people of color, especially Black filers, who are more likely than their white counterparts to claim the EITC. In recent correspondence to Congress, IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel acknowledged this issue and announced that the agency would adjust resources to focus collection and compliance efforts on high-income taxpayers. This was also reflected in the IRS’s 2023 Strategic Operating Plan. EITC Audits and Improper Payments While higher-income taxpayers are more likely to be audited—those with incomes above $1 million face higher audit rates than all others earnings less— EITC claimants are audited at 5.5 times the rate of the rest of the population. This is due in part to its improper payment rate as well as efficiency factors: The EITC&#8217;s improper payment rate has increased in recent years (from 24% in 2020 to 32% in 2022). Improper EITC payments are those received by people who are either ineligible for the credit or receive more than they should by law. Some improper claims are fraudulent, but many are honest mistakes by individuals confused by the EITC’s complicated eligibility rules. The average audit of an EITC recipient can be closed in five hours. Meanwhile, high-income tax returns are far more complex to audit; for those with income over $10 million, an audit may take several years and require a live caseworker, thus decreasing the hourly return on investment. Source: TRAC, Syracuse University Racial Disparities in EITC Audits Audits can place a significant financial burden on individuals—especially low-income workers eligible to claim the EITC—given that their tax refunds are often frozen during the process. Furthermore, eligible individuals may be denied the EITC if they cannot navigate the complex audit process successfully. These adverse encounters can dissuade eligible EITC claimants, particularly those in vulnerable communities. A 2023 Stanford University study assessed comprehensive microdata from the Treasury Department on approximately 148 million tax returns and 780,000 audits conducted between 2010 and 2018. It found that Black taxpayers are, in general, 2.9 to 4.7 times more likely to be audited than non-Black taxpayers. Nearly 80% of the difference occurred due to Black EITC claimants being audited at higher rates than white EITC claimants.&hellip;",

    "content": "The 2023 housing market was defined by increasing unaffordability—the result of rising mortgage rates, elevated rents and house prices, and continued supply constraints. Below we review these key trends, highlight improving conditions to watch for in 2024, and note a few implications policymakers should consider. Record High-Interest Rates Before Year-End Dip Interest rates rose steadily over the course of 2023, with January 30-year mortgage rates at 6.48% and peaked at 7.79% in October, the highest rate seen since 2000. Since October, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage has fallen 84 basis points, helping foster a slight rebound in builder sentiment, a jump in the number of housing units that started construction, an increase in the number of homes listed for sale, and an uptick in mortgage applications. The consumer price index (CPI), which is used to measure inflation, did not increase in October, after slowing steadily in August and September. Year-over-year inflation at 3.2% is higher than the Fed’s goal of 2%, though much lower than the 6.3% at the start of the year. Shelter costs remain high, up 6.7% year-over-year in October and continue to offset declines in other areas measured by CPI. Limited For-Sale Inventory and Higher Costs for Homebuyers Despite rising mortgage rates, home prices have not decreased significantly due to limited housing supply. While the median sale price began to drop in the summer of 2022 as the Fed’s rate hikes quickly translated into higher homebuying costs, prices started to climb again at the start of 2023 and reached the previous record high of $365,000 in June 2023. Higher home prices and higher mortgage rates means that buying has become much more expensive relative to renting. A buyer purchasing a home at June’s median price of $365,000, with a 20% downpayment and 6.7% mortgage rate, would have a monthly housing payment of $1,884. For the same price, with the same downpayment in June 2022, when a 5.09% mortgage rate was available, the monthly housing payment would be $300 cheaper—a 15.9% difference in overall cost. The impact of inflation and higher borrowing costs has been felt throughout the housing market. Home sales fell 20.2% year-over-year from August 2022 to August 2023, and the number of new listings fell 9.29% year-over-year from September 2022 to September 2023, based on data from Zillow. The number of active home listings fluctuated between 600,000 and 750,000 throughout the year, with a dip to 560,000 in March. These inventory levels are still far below pre-pandemic levels that regularly topped 1 million, but higher than the lowest levels in 2021 and 2022. Homeowners who took out mortgages when interest rates were two to three times lower than they are now are extremely reluctant to sell, leading to fewer existing homes available in the market. Strong competition for limited inventory continues to mean that homes for sale do not last long. New construction has helped to fill the gap, making up more of the available inventory than is typical for the market. In August&hellip;",

    "content": "According to the most recent national count, 653,104 people were experiencing homelessness across the United States on a single night in January 2023—an increase of 70,642 people (12%) from 2022. At the time of the count, one out of every 500 people in the U.S. was unhoused. The numbers from the 2023 Point-in-Time (PIT) count represent the single largest one-year increase in homelessness since the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development began collecting data in 2007. Diving into the data, the PIT count finds an overall increase in homelessness across all genders, ages, ethnicities, and races; among individuals and families with children; and in sheltered and unsheltered locations. This blog highlights key takeaways from the 2023 PIT Count and identifies trends to watch for as policymakers at all levels of government work to stem historic increases in homelessness across the country. Quick Takeaways The PIT count, published as part one of HUD’s Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), is an estimate of homelessness based on data collected by Continuums of Care (CoCs), regional or local planning bodies across the country that coordinate housing and services for homeless families and individuals. These counts are conducted by local volunteers on a single night in January and are a snapshot of homelessness. While imperfect, the PIT count is one of the most important sources of data on homelessness nationwide. Beyond the all-time-high PIT count, the 2023 AHAR included several key takeaways: The increase in homelessness is national in scope. From 2022 to 2023, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased in 41 states and D.C. Chronic homelessness has worsened across the country, with 33 states and D.C. seeing an increase in the number of individuals experiencing chronic patterns of homelessness from 2022 to 2023. In January 2023, 60% of people experiencing homelessness were staying in sheltered locations, while 40% were residing outside and in other places not fit for human habitation. Homelessness response and rehousing systems across the country added significant capacity: total beds across temporary shelters and permanent housing programs increased 6.4% from 2022, 18.1% since the last pre-pandemic count, and 82% since the first count in 2007. Despite this increase in inventory, the 2023 count identified a 200,000-shelter bed shortfall compared to the total number of people experiencing homelessness. Unsheltered homelessness was at the highest level it has ever been since data reporting began in 2007. 72% of people experiencing homelessness were individuals, while the remaining 28% were part of households with children. Among individuals, the 2023 PIT Count found an historically high 143,105 people experiencing chronic homelessness—a 12% increase from 2022. Within this group, 92,968 people (65%) live in unsheltered locations. For the first time, the 2023 PIT expanded its age categories to identify people experiencing homelessness across five ranges: 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 or older. This approach is consistent with takeaways from BPC’s 2016 Senior Health and Housing Task Force report, which recommended that HUD should take a more granular approach in monitoring homelessness among older adults.&hellip;",

    "content": "During my six-year tenure in the Oklahoma State Senate, I was privileged to sponsor bipartisan legislation related to various crucial issues such as health care, education, and criminal justice reform. My most noteworthy contribution came through my work on child welfare initiatives. I collaborated with my colleagues across party lines to establish a foster care system for young individuals involved in the juvenile justice system. Additionally, we addressed the definition of “failure to protect” in legal codes and defined the critical components of a children&#8217;s emergency resource center designed to support families in crisis. No other work was as significant to me as my commitment to promoting strong families and ensuring the well-being of children. Americans across the political spectrum recognize and agree that a safe and nurturing environment is crucial for children’s growth and development. Based on my experience in Oklahoma, despite a growing political divide, legislators from different parties can still come together to pursue this goal and address challenges in the child welfare system. Bipartisanship serves as an essential unifying force and is a cornerstone of effective governance. Government functions at its best when bipartisan collaboration transcends party lines to find common ground. Working cooperatively fosters compromise, ensures that public policies are informed, well-rounded, and representative of diverse perspectives. This cooperative approach not only strengthens the fabric of democracy but also instills public confidence in the legislative process. Bipartisanship is a testament to shared values, demonstrating that, despite ideological differences, lawmakers can unite for the greater good. There is no greater good than protecting the well-being of children. New data from the Bipartisan Policy Center—including a national public opinion poll and, released today, a 50-state legislative review—indicates numerous opportunities for state legislators to continue bipartisan collaboration to reform child welfare. The 50-state review found legislators introduced 567 bills addressing child welfare in 2022 and 2023, with 146 enacted. Of the enacted bills, 58 were introduced by Republicans, 33 by Democrats, and 55 had bipartisan cosponsorship. These results indicate that state legislators from both political parties share concerns about children and families served by child welfare and want positive outcomes for these families. Policy issues of interest to both parties include: establishing the Indian Child Welfare Act in state policy, improving system oversight, narrowing the definition of neglect, improving the reliability and quality of reporting and investigating, improving prevention and family preservation services, strengthening financial support to kinship and adoptive families, strengthening and supporting foster parenting, supporting the unique needs of youth in foster care, and addressing workforce issues. Prevention to intervention and permanency, providing opportunities for lawmakers to address public concerns, implement system improvements, and deploy effective practices are all areas of bipartisan agreement. State legislators’ role in implementing best practices, such as kinship care, is essential. Legislation introduced by both parties and available research indicates bipartisan agreement that kinship care is a crucial and compassionate solution, supporting familial stability amid tumultuous circumstances. As an alternative to traditional foster care, kinship care places children with relatives or&hellip;",

    "content": "The Department of Energy’s Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs, or H2Hubs, poses an opportunity for the United States to scale clean energy infrastructure while bolstering economic growth. Spanning more than 16 states and 100 congressional districts, the H2Hubs program aims to establish regional clusters of clean hydrogen producers and end users. The seven H2Hubs represent a diverse collection of American communities, from Appalachia to the Pacific Northwest and down through the Gulf Coast. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s preliminary analysis of the congressional representation of the H2Hubs shows that three of the hubs are represented by majority Republican members, three are represented by majority Democratic members, and one (the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub) is located across congressional districts split between both parties. Each H2Hub is a collection of geographic locations; congressional representation of a hub is determined by analyzing the congressional districts that overlap with that hub’s locations. See the full list here. Note: This analysis is based on potential location of hub projects that is subject to change with local input and other project considerations. There is a long history of bipartisan support for clean hydrogen. The $8 billion H2Hubs program, authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden, is just the latest in a deep history of bipartisan collaboration for this important energy carrier. Hydrogen research and demonstration was first connected to the national interest in 1990 when former President George H.W. Bush signed the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen, Research, Development and Demonstration Act into law. Two decades later, an effort to modernize and renew investment in clean hydrogen innovation passed on a bipartisan basis in the Energy Act of 2020 signed into law by President Donald Trump. The H2Hubs represent the next step in this legacy to facilitate the rapid scale-up of clean hydrogen technology. The potential benefits of H2Hubs are noteworthy, especially in areas with existing industrial resources, infrastructure, and workforce skills—helping to ease the impacts of the clean energy transition, create jobs, and strengthen local economies. The Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub is situated in a region with extensive industrial activity, and the region’s existing infrastructure and skilled workforce present an opportunity to kickstart decarbonization of heavy industry while boosting local economic activity–more than 35,000 construction jobs and 10,000 permanent jobs are anticipated at this hub. The total economic impact of the Appalachian Hydrogen Hub is estimated to reach $6 billion, bringing opportunities for skills transfer and workforce training for existing skilled labor while tapping into the region’s geological storage potential for captured carbon. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub, leveraging its proximity to the agricultural sector, will help expand American-made fertilizer production using clean hydrogen, providing a secure, reliable, domestic fertilizer source for America’s growers. To set up the conditions for success, leaders of H2Hubs will need to cultivate trust and enthusiasm through robust community engagement to avoid siting challenges and preemptive project rejections that have hindered past demonstration and energy infrastructure buildouts.

One of these conversations included a stop in Columbus, OH, to hear how competitiveness is defined, what has been driving the city’s success, and what is next for the region. Fast Facts: Columbus, OH Leader in Growth | Columbus outperformed the rest of Ohio in post-COVID economic recovery and in 2021, was the 33rd largest metro economy nationwide. Economic Contributors| Columbus is a versatile economic center, with opportunities in higher education, farming and agriculture, manufacturing, and the automotive industry. Budding Industry Investments | Tech and automotive companies are building data centers and manufacturing facilities in Franklin County, proving that economic expansion comes from various sectors. The Heart of it All Columbus, OH, is America’s 14th most populated city, and with continuous economic and population growth, this Midwestern city is one to keep an eye on. As with our other roundtables, we wanted to understand how local stakeholders define competitiveness. Interestingly, in Columbus, it turns out they don’t: Participants laid out a different approach, steering clear of the term “competitiveness” and instead opting to describe themselves as rooted in “collaborative-ness.” Participants coined this term to better describe the integral nature of the cooperation taking place within the community. They aren’t just collaborating with one another in Columbus—it is a condition to their economic growth. Embracing this strategy involves community stakeholders joining forces to address and promote economic growth. Participants recognize the inherent strength of the region and understand that Columbus is prime for investment because of its multifaceted economy and ideal geographic location. Moreover, there is a realization that the community can leverage current and new private and public investments. Strategically, Columbus does not rely on only one sector for growth. The Columbus City School District, the largest in the state, The Ohio State University, and Columbus State Community College are actively working to capitalize on education as a catalyst for economic development. The recent growth of Columbus’ population extends beyond sheer numbers, showcasing diversity that surpasses Ohio’s demographic trends. As the workforce has diversified, so have the industries that make up the region’s economy. Given the steady stream of new residents and industry growth in Columbus, participants were asked about the factors contributing to the region’s appeal. They pointed to geographical advantages, citing the absence of natural disasters, proximity to major cities (for individuals and cargo transportation), and took pride in the city’s abundant resources, including large supplies of natural gas, cost-effective energy, and a relatively affordable cost of living.  A Tale of Three Cities While the term “competitiveness” may not resonate in the Columbus region, it is inherent throughout the state. Ohio has three major metropolitan areas: Cleveland in the northeast, Cinccinati in the southwest, and Columbus in the middle. These three cities make up what is known as the “three C’s” and function almost as &#8220;city-states,&#8221; sparking some rivalry among them. Each&hellip;",

    "content": "Encounters at the border have reached record levels in recent years. The Biden administration, like many of its recent predecessors, has tried and failed to address this issue and counter criticisms from both ends of the political spectrum. The rise in border apprehensions necessitates an understanding of the impact of border policies as Congress considers various reforms. This blog outlines the impact on apprehension numbers of the implementation and/or termination of various immigration policies at the border during the Trump and  Biden administrations, such as the Zero Tolerance Policy, Migrant Protection Protocol (MPP), Prompt Asylum Claim Review (PACR), Humanitarian Asylum Review Process (HARP), Third Country Asylum Rule (Trump), Title 42, Family Expedited Removal Management (FERM), Circumvention of Lawful Pathways Rule (Biden), and the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan Parole programs. There is significant overlap of many of these policies, and some, like MPP, were stopped and re-started by litigation during this time period resulting in inconsistent border policy. 254 Apprehensions Levels and Policy Changes The chart below displays how or whether the policies may have influenced border apprehension numbers based on their start and end dates. Border apprehension numbers refer to the count of individuals detained at the Southwest land border by U.S. Border Patrol and excludes those encountered at legal crossings. While the graph may indicate some correlations, it should not be interpreted as determinative of causation. Southern Border Apprehensions and Policy Changes (2014-present) Graphics by Alexander Varisco Overall, the data highlights the absence of a consistent immigration policy at the border. It is challenging to attribute a surge or decline in apprehension numbers to the implementation of a specific policy when multiple policies are in play at any given time, and so many policies and other factors impact migration patterns. Additionally, different border areas may have had different policies in place due to local conditions. Some programs apply only to certain nationalities, such as the country-specific parole programs or the PACR and HARP programs, or to specific demographics, such as the FERM program. Since we only map overall apprehensions in this blog, a more granular look at how these programs may have influenced different demographics might show different responses. Extraneous factors also contribute to border apprehension numbers. For instance, Title 42 was implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic alongside general travel restrictions within and between the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other countries in the hemisphere that could have also affected border encounters. Throughout the period, countries may have lifted or applied visa or other travel restrictions to certain nationalities that could limit movement through the hemisphere. It should also be noted that while other policies during the Trump administration technically remained in place after Title 42 began, for all practical purposes they were not used in favor of the Title 42 expulsions until they were formally ended by the Biden administration. Finally, unintended outcomes of various policies may also affect the apprehension numbers. It has been widely acknowledged migrants to Mexico during Title 42 resulted in higher numbers&hellip;",

    "content": "More than 46 million taxpayers claim the Child Tax Credit (CTC) each year, and recent temporary expansions have sparked debate in Congress about the credit’s future. Lawmakers have many decisions before them, including: What the per-child credit amount should be; How much of the credit should be available to parents who owe very little or nothing in federal income taxes; and Whether the full credit should go to parents with little or no earnings. This blog concerns the latter two questions—among the most important for Congress to answer when reforming the CTC: the “refundability question” and the “earnings requirements question.” The Refundability Question Under current law, the CTC is $2,000 per child but only $1,600 per child is refundable. This means only $1,600 per child is available to parents who owe little to nothing in federal income taxes. Some lawmakers talk about making the CTC fully refundable, meaning the full credit would be available to taxpayers even if their federal income tax liability is less than the credit amount. Example A: John and Jane are married joint filers with two dependent children under age 17. John and Jane earned $30,000 in 2023. They take the standard deduction on their tax return, valued at $27,700, meaning that only $2,300 of their income is subject to federal income taxes ($30,000-$27,700 = $2,300). That puts them in the lowest tax bracket (10%), meaning they owe $230 in federal income taxes ($2,300 * 10% = $230). If the CTC were fully refundable, John and Jane would receive $4,000 (the maximum of $2,000 per child, multiplied by two children). Under current law, however, only $1,600 per child is available as a refundable amount, so John and Jane receive $3,430 ($1,600 per child, multiplied by two children, for the refundable amount, plus $230 that offsets their income tax liability). Example A: John and Jane Filing Status Married Filing Jointly Children 2 2023 Earnings $30,000 2023 Standard Deduction $27,700 2023 Taxable Income $2,300 Tax Bracket 10% 2023 Tax Liability $230 2023 CTC Non-Refundable Amount $230 2023 CTC Refundable Amount $3,200 ($1,600 per child) CTC Amount $3,430 The Earnings Requirements Question Other lawmakers talk about ensuring the CTC continues to incentivize workforce participation, meaning there are earnings requirements (thresholds) to claim it. Lawmakers seeking to eliminate earnings requirements want to make the CTC available to taxpayers regardless of their earnings. This is different than refundability, which concerns income taxes. Eligibility to claim the CTC is determined by and phases in with one’s earnings: Anyone earning less than $2,500 annually is currently ineligible to claim the credit. Starting at $2,500 in earnings, the credit phases in at a 15% rate, meaning for every $100 earned above $2,500, a taxpayer receives $15 in CTC. For example, a taxpayer with $3,500 in earnings would receive $150 in CTC ($3,500 &#8211; $2,500 = $1,000; $1,000 * 15% = $150). A taxpayer with multiple children must phase in the credit amount one child at a time. Example B: Mark and Mary are married&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress has barely managed to meet important deadlines in recent years. There seemingly is never enough time to complete even their most basic functions. Since being a member of Congress is a full-time job, why are things always left to the last minute? Part of the answer may lie in the legislative calendar. The House recently released its official 2024 calendar, which reflects an increased number of days members will work in Washington and a decreased number of days members can travel compared to 2023. This change reflects a key recommendation of the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. In its 2020 report, the Committee noted that “while many factors lead to missed deadlines and gridlock, a prominent suggestion for reform is requiring members to spend more time in Washington working on behalf of the American people.” However, BPC proposes an alternative calendar that 1) further reduces members’ travel time while also increasing the time available for legislative work in DC; 2) maintains the traditional August recess; and 3) provides ample time in their districts for constituent work and campaigns. Our calendar would make the schedule more efficient for members and provide more time for Congress to complete its basic duties. First, some context. In 2018, the most recent election year not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,  members of the House were traveling back-and-forth to their districts more days (62) than they had in Washington (59). Legislative work will and can be done on travel days, but they are necessarily truncated and leave less time for robust deliberation, let alone constituent meetings, party caucus or conference business, and relationship building. During election years, it is typical to expect members to spend significant time in their districts fulfilling their representational duties—meeting with constituents, visiting businesses, and assessing the state of infrastructure firsthand— while also being home for campaign events. The 2018 calendar, shown below, provided 22 weeks dedicated to district work, represented in grey. The workdays spent in Washington are represented in blue and travel days are in red. However, the 2018 calendar amounted to only two full days per week for members’ legislative duties in the Capitol. Those duties include attending committee meetings and voting on the House floor. Since each member is usually on five or more committees and subcommittees, the limited days they have in Washington cause critically high scheduling conflicts and make it incredibly difficult for our representatives to be fully present for witness testimony, nuanced policy discussions, and opportunities to foster bipartisan relations. The official 2024 calendar, shown below, affords members an estimated 57 full workdays in Washington, about the same as 2018. There is a slight decrease in estimated travel days— 56 —in 2024 compared to 2018. BPC’s 2024 proposal is for a one-week on, one-week off rhythm with three full days in Washington when the House is in session. This would give members 70 full days—an increase of 13 days from the announced 2024 calendar—and only 38 travel days, a significant decrease&hellip;",

    "content": "Legislators in Wisconsin have proposed sweeping reforms to the state’s election administration apparatus just months before the 2024 election. The legislation would abolish the bipartisan Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC), centralizing election administration authority in an office with no elections experience and subjecting all of the office’s elections-related actions to the approval of the state legislature. This approach to abolishing the WEC would create new opportunities for administrative errors and increase the potential for partisan manipulation. While Governor Tony Evers said he would veto the bill, Wisconsin serves as a microcosm for broader national debates on electoral integrity. How Wisconsin navigates these changes could set a precedent for other states considering similar reforms. At a precarious moment for public confidence in elections, state lawmakers should focus their attention on promoting election management structures that put bipartisan cooperation and secure, trustworthy elections front and center – just like the WEC has been doing for years. The fight to increase partisan influence over elections In a 2022 report, BPC and the Election Reformers Network warned: “The growing susceptibility to partisan incentives in election offices undermines the expectation that elections will result in legitimate winners. While, in the past, the individuals administering the elections process operated with relative obscurity, party leaders have targeted them and their offices in the hopes of controlling the voting process. This amplified attention may incentivize extreme partisans to attempt to subvert, undermine, or overturn an election. Acting with political self-interest, partisan officials could use their power to undermine legitimate and fair elections and overturn the will of the people.” Our nation’s roughly 10,000 election administrators are committed public servants tirelessly devoted to free and fair elections. Yet, to date, this structure has primarily relied on election officials operating with good faith; institutions like the WEC provide bipartisan checks and balances on election administration. As it currently stands, the WEC—tasked with administering and enforcing election laws—requires bipartisan cooperation and buy-in: The commission is led by six commissioners appointed by the governor and state legislative leaders from the majority and minority parties. The commission is led by a nonpartisan administrator appointed by members of the commission and confirmed by the state Senate. Decisions of the commission must have support from commissioners of both parties. Under proposed reforms Wisconsin’s electoral system would change significantly, limiting bipartisanship and introducing further risk of partisan clashes. The reforms would: Abolish the WEC. Make the Secretary of State—an office with no electoral responsibilities currently—the state’s chief election official. Require state legislative review and approval of Secretary of State’s decisions. Sweeping reorganization opens the door to glitches, errors, and delays While secretaries of state across the country are frequently the chief elections officer in their respective jurisdictions, Wisconsin’s currently performs no electoral duties. The office only employs two officials, with a budget of $250,000 per year. Despite having no statutory responsibilities in the area, Democratic Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski has expressed interest in expanding her office’s role in election policy, concerning the state’s current election administrators.

While many face hurdles navigating complex eligibility rules and the tax filing process, immigrants encounter additional barriers that can negatively impact income, educational, and health outcomes. This blog explores structural, social, and psychological barriers that immigrant workers and their families face in claiming these two tax credits. Structural Barriers to Take-Up Immigrant eligibility for public benefits—such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Social Security—has historically been complicated and contingent on the specific program and citizenship and/or residency status of the individual or family, which has changed several times recently. Although the tax filer does not need a Social Security Number (SSN) to claim the CTC, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) limited CTC eligibility to dependents with SSNs, eliminating access for around one million children previously eligible to be claimed. The EITC is also inaccessible to filers without an SSN, which restricts access for over five million Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) filers. Eligibility policy changes and differences between programs increase claiming confusion. The CTC and EITC’s Eligibility Requirements   CTC Under TCJA Expansion EITC: Workers with Children Under Permanent Law EITC: Childless Workers Under Permanent Law Citizenship Status/Residency Claimed dependents must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident. Claimed dependents must have lived with the taxpayer for more than half of the tax year, except for temporary absences due to special circumstances. Must be a U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident for the entire tax year; if filing jointly and during any part of the year the claiming individual or their spouse were a nonresident, they are only eligible if they or their spouse is a U.S. citizen with an SSN or is a resident who was in the U.S. at least six months of the year they are filing and has an SSN.

    "content": "The Executive Order (EO) on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence is a significant step toward implementing a whole of government approach for establishing comprehensive standards and guidelines for the safe and secure use of AI. The EO leverages voluntary initiatives, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, backed by industry commitments to improve AI development practices. This approach aligns with BPC’s recommendations in our AI National Strategy for Congress. The strategy, which culminated in H.Res. 1250, called for a comprehensive governance framework to ensure the responsible use of AI for the future and accelerate the United States’ position as a global technology leader. The EO represents a pivotal moment in the responsible AI landscape, and closely monitoring the actions that follow to achieve the administration’s broad goals is critical. In this blog, we discuss the key takeaways, identify outstanding gaps and AI governance challenges, and inform actions for the future. 10 Key Takeaways: 1) AI Safety and Security The order requires coordinated development of standards and regulations, compelling companies to report their procedures in developing, training, and testing of some of the largest AI models that could pose a security risk to the U.S., in accordance with the Defense Production Act. Companies that meet the technical conditions must report red-team safety testing results and security measures to the government. 2) Civil Rights and Equity The order encourages greater research and standards to address the potential for AI to lead to discrimination or bias in the federal government benefits administration, criminal justice system, or making housing or hiring decisions. In addition, the EO tasks the Department of Justice and federal civil rights offices with addressing algorithmic discrimination by collaborating with stakeholders and providing training, guidance, and best practices to state, local, Tribal, and territorial investigators and prosecutors. 3) Protections for Individuals The order directs the Department of Labor to publish guidelines for best practices for employers to limit AI impacts on health and safety, workplace equity, harmful data collection practices, and employees’ ability to organize. It also signals a reorientation of existing job training and education programs to support a diverse workforce and build resilience for the impacts of AI. 4) Hire, Recruit, and Train AI Talent in the Federal Government Supporting recent efforts to bolster federal government hiring, the order outlines a plan to advance existing federal technology talent programs to recruit and retain AI talent to keep pace with the rapid evolution of AI technologies. The plan includes reviewing current hiring practices, establishing new guidance for pay flexibility or incentive pay programs, and strengthening existing federal tech talent programs like the U.S. Digital Service and Presidential Innovation Fellowship. 5) AI Talent and Immigration Pathways The order leverages existing authorities to modernize and streamline pathways for highly skilled immigrants and nonimmigrants to study and work in the U.S. It also&hellip;",

    "content": "Carbon utilization, the act of repurposing captured carbon dioxide to create usable products, is an emerging frontier for clean energy and manufacturing that aims to help fight climate change, create domestic jobs, and contribute to significant economic growth. Because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the strengthened 45Q tax credit, carbon capture and direct air capture (DAC) are widely anticipated to be scaled over the coming decade. Once CO2 has been captured, it can either be permanently stored underground or repurposed in the production of traditional commodities such as fuels, concrete, baking soda, and even everyday items like shoes. On September 26, the Bipartisan Policy Center hosted a “Carbon Utilization Celebration” on Capitol Hill, which brought together policymakers and carbon utilization industry leaders and experts to discuss and celebrate the recent strides made by the carbon utilization industry. The event included a panel discussion featuring senior representatives from carbon utilization companies followed by an industry technology showcase. Below are several key takeaways from the event. Takeaway 1: Growth of the carbon utilization industry presents a major economic opportunity for American companies There is a growing appetite for climate-friendly commercial products that are produced with minimal emissions. Carbon utilization techniques provide an opportunity for American companies to create economic value from CO2 captured from smokestacks or directly from the atmosphere. According to the International Energy Agency, $484 million in venture capital (VC) investments went to utilization companies in 2022, which is expected to significantly help grow the market for CO2 use by 10 million tons by the end of the decade. This market is also heavily concentrated in the United States, with 80% of total global VC investments in carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) between 2015 and 2022 flowing towards American companies. Panelists pointed out that in addition to lowering overall emissions, using CO2 in productive ways can generate essential revenue for carbon capture and removal (CDR) technologies, helping to spur innovation and scale infrastructure. Takeaway 2: To scale up utilization, equal policy support must be given for equal climate solutions Given the sheer scale of the climate challenge, the private sector must deploy effective innovative climate solutions as quickly as possible. The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture currently awards a lower credit value for captured CO2 that is utilized than captured CO2 that is sequestered underground in Class VI wells. Claiming the 45Q tax credit for utilization requires quantifying the climate impact through a life cycle analysis (LCA) that compares emissions from a process with utilized carbon to a baseline level of emissions carried out without the utilization practice. Because of this LCA, the net emissions of utilization pathways can be compared directly to permanent sequestration through geologic storage. Panelists pointed out that despite this apples-to-apples comparison, the 45Q tax credit unfairly penalizes utilization pathways with a lower credit value, relative to permanent geologic storage, sending the wrong signal to industry that government prioritizes one effective carbon solution over another. Some panelists pointed to the bipartisan, bicameral Carbon&hellip;",

    "content": "Detroit is poised to be the first major American city to experiment with a land value tax (LVT) on a meaningful scale, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of a tax policy that has largely gone untested in the United States despite its historical prominence. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has recently proposed a split-rate tax to be levied on all property to replace the current singular property tax. Land value taxation has a rich history in economic theory, and this experiment warrants a refresher on the concept. Land value taxation finds its patriarch in 19th century economist Henry George, whose magnum opus, Progress and Poverty, sold more copies than every book in America besides the Bible for several decades. George proposed a system where taxing the intrinsic value of land would be the primary form of government revenue, instead of a tax on the total value of a property (or any other taxes for that matter, such as income or capital gains taxes). Modern Georgists do not go that far, with most believing that the current system of singular property taxes should be replaced with a two-tiered LVT. LVTs work by taxing land in much greater proportion to the value of the buildings and property that sit on top of the land. In Detroit, which aims to keep its LVT system revenue-neutral with the current property tax regime, this means reducing the property tax on the assessed value of buildings from 2% to 0.6% and replacing the lost revenue with an 11.8% tax on land itself (hence the split-value tax). LVTs have several theoretical benefits which make them appealing to economists and policymakers alike. Land value taxation is an especially efficient form of taxation because it is non-distortive, i.e., it does not affect consumer and producer decision-making. Most forms of taxation, such as income and capital gains taxes, are inefficient because they change the price of the taxed activity and, as a result, alter market behavior (usually by discouraging economic activity). In comparison, LVTs do not alter market behavior because the supply of land is fixed and taxes on its intrinsic value are allocatively neutral (cannot be passed along to consumers and the owners of land cannot simply produce more or less land as a result of an LVT). Land value taxation also has the benefit of discouraging land speculation and limiting urban sprawl. Because taxes would be assessed largely on the value of the land itself, and not the improvements put atop the land, property owners would no longer be discouraged from developing their property to the full extent for risk of raising their tax bill. In theory, LVTs should make housing more affordable, as land value taxation encourages property owners to develop their land as the price of speculation becomes more costly, thus increasing the supply of housing where zoning permits. While LVTs provide a lot for economists to like, the biggest issues come with the practical implementation. To have its desired effects, the LVT would&hellip;",

    "content": "The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) blurs the line between human and machine creativity, impressing the world with its art-making and innovative potential. The creative industry is ripe for GAI applications. For example, an upcoming film will de-age Tom Hanks using a new Metaphysic GAI tool. The new technology allows filmmakers to capture data from actors to replicate their performances and insert them into future movies without physically being present on the set. The Beatles broke new creative barriers by co-producing a new song with the use of AI. Production studios are increasingly integrating AI into the entertainment industry because it is more cost-effective than employing humans for content creation. Reshoots can be a significant production cost. The latest Superman movie, “Man of Steel,” required several costly reshoots before premiering because the lead for the movie needed to have facial hair digitally removed. In this instance using GAI would have saved money and improved quality. Generative AI is transforming the industry, unleashing new opportunities for human creativity and innovative potential. However, concerns about AI usage on job displacement, copyright, and data privacy played a key role in the recent labor disputes in Hollywood. This blog dives into the specifics of the disputes and workforce implications of companies adopting new AI technology and how GAI impacts creative professionals. The Hollywood Strike This summer two different labor unions, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Writers Guilds went on strike, for four and five months respectively, against the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers (AMPTP), whose members include Amazon, Netflix, Apple, and the big five U.S. studios. Both unions were concerned with how to safeguard their members against disruptions caused by Generative AI. GAI was seen as a threat to writers’ livelihoods if studios were to use GAI to replace writing roles, and actors wanted to safeguard their identities and personalities (‘likeness’) from being digitally recreated without their consent. Workforce Implications According to Goldman Sachs (refer to figure 1), artificial intelligence has the potential to automate approximately 25% of existing work tasks across the United States, and 26% of traditional work-related activities within the arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media. Figure 1 Image: Goldman Sachs Generative AI’s rising capabilities are accelerating the need to establish frameworks that safeguard worker rights and address job disruption, while also leveraging the technology to boost productivity and create new jobs. During the strikes, the entertainment industry negotiated potential remedies for protecting worker rights by emphasizing consent, compensation, and credit for utilizing artists’ work in collaboration with AI. The AMPTP proposed new protections for actors and crew such as wage increases and health contributions, even if studios partially rely on AI tools. For example, the new SAG-AFTRA agreement includes “compensation for the use of Employment-Based Digital Replica for the number of production days that Producer determines the performer would have been required to work.” Policy initiatives are also taking place to protect creative workers from job displacement due to&hellip;",

    "content": "As the 2024 election rapidly approaches, Pennsylvania’s voters deserve to feel confident in the processes and systems they’ll use next November. All eyes will be on Pennsylvania and a handful of other battleground states, making it even more critical that this election runs securely and smoothly. The Pennsylvania legislature must act to provide election officials with the necessary resources and tools to meet the expected demand for absentee balloting and avoid unnecessary delays in election results that risk eroding trust in results. While partisan divides on voting methods emerged over the last several election cycles, Pennsylvanian voters who choose to cast a mail-in or absentee ballot before election day should have their votes included in the election night returns. Pennsylvania is one of a few states, particularly among battleground states, that bars election officials from pre-canvassing absentee ballots before election day. This policy significantly slows the reporting of election results in high-turnout elections. To help improve public confidence in election results, the legislature should permit election offices to begin pre-canvassing ballots – preparing them for tabulation – at least seven days before election day.  Allowing election officials to pre-canvass ballots provides additional time to verify voter eligibility, remove ballots from security envelopes, and prepare the ballots for counting. More ballots will be ready to be tabulated after the polls close on election day, expediting the release of more complete results with greater efficiency, speed, and accuracy. Starting the work before election day enables election administrators more time to plan workflows, troubleshoot unexpected issues that may arise, and communicate directly with voters.  Thirty-eight states, including Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, allow ballot pre-canvassing. Pennsylvania’s election administrators have long argued the change would enable the Commonwealth to report its election results more quickly, and the County Commissioner Association of Pennsylvania supports extending pre-canvassing time. Pre-canvassing helps election officials give voters information about the status of their ballot and opportunities to correct discrepancies. Voters occasionally make mistakes when filling out their ballot envelopes, underscoring the importance of clear and consistent standards for correcting errors. Voters in twenty-four states can correct — or “cure”— problems on their ballot envelope. Since 2020, states including Indiana, Kentucky, North Dakota, and Texas have codified ballot curing. In Pennsylvania, ballot curing is not equally available to all voters; it is left to the discretion of county officials and is often dependent on the availability of resources. Discretionary decision-making in election policy creates opportunities for voters to question the fairness of the process. The availability, process, and timeline to cure ballots should be the same for all Pennsylvania voters.   Codifying one ballot curing standard is essential to uphold election integrity and voter access. Pennsylvania should also codify a straightforward process and standards for missing or incorrect dates and so-called “naked ballots.” In January, the Pennsylvania Commonwealths Joints State Government Commission released bipartisan policy recommendations to improve the administration of elections, including a proposal to clarify that a voter’s failure to date a ballot will not be the sole basis&hellip;",

To explore this changing landscape, BPC spent the past nine months listening to the diverse perspectives of those working for, involved with, and directly affected by child welfare policy. These conversations informed the launch of our new Child Welfare Initiative and demonstrated widespread consensus on challenges in the field. Despite ideological differences, we found strong agreement on the direction the field should be going and acknowledgment of the difficulty in building common ground solutions. This blog summarizes BPC’s landscape assessment. These findings will inform our work to facilitate the development and implementation of effective, bipartisan policies. Defining Child Welfare Child welfare includes an array of federal and state policies relating to how the government intervenes to prevent or address child neglect and abuse. This encompasses policies across the child welfare continuum, including but not limited to, child maltreatment prevention; child protective services, including how reports of suspected cases of abuse and neglect are received and responded to; family strengthening programs; foster care; reunification; kinship; and adoption. Landscape Assessment Methodology To gather information about the child welfare policy environment, BPC conducted: more than 100 interviews with those with lived experience (foster care alumni, birth parents, kinship caregivers, foster and adoptive families), agency leaders and staff, policymakers, judicial officials, faith leaders, tribal leaders, researchers, service providers, and advocates a dozen small group discussions with foster care alumni, birth parents, caregivers, provider agencies, agency leaders, law enforcement and judges site visits to two states to engage stakeholders in Republican and Democratic-leaning communities surveys of community representatives, caseworkers, caregivers, and faith leaders nationally representative poll and two representative state polls, in Georgia and Ohio, conducted by The Harris Poll 50-state review of child welfare legislation (findings coming soon) media scan examining how child welfare appears in news and social media platforms (coming in 2024) Five Key Findings from Landscape Assessment 1) Significant consensus exists on many of the major challenges currently facing the child welfare field Stakeholders largely agree the most urgent challenges include: insufficient workforce capacity and skills high needs of youth and lack of sufficient services child welfare becoming a catch-all system, resulting in some children and families being inappropriately involved lack of appropriate placement resources and concerns about unsafe placements, such as hotels and offices lack of accessible, appropriate mental health services to meet heightened demand among children, parents, and the workforce barriers to implementation of the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018 persistent challenges meeting the basic needs of youth aging out of foster care at age 18 bureaucratic red tape not fully leveraging lived experience and expertise 2) Significant consensus exists around the need to improve child welfare systems through strengthened implementation of existing policies and targeted new reforms that clarify and scale up best practices and reduce system burden.

Artificial intelligence can accurately detect diseases years before diagnosis; pilot self-driving vehicles; and direct robots to harvest crops. AI algorithms power our social media platforms. It is an intelligent, versatile, and deeply complex technology that has only scratched the surface of its massive potential. But people tend to fear what they do not understand, which is why warnings of an AI-driven apocalypse remain dire. After a wave of federal legislation, congressional hearings, Majority Leader Schumer’s AI Insight Forums, and President Biden’s landmark Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, one thing many agree on when it comes to AI governance is transparency. The inability to understand how AI systems reach their conclusions is known as the “black box problem.” To instill public trust in AI systems, American citizens deserve to know what is happening behind the curtain of these powerful technologies. “Transparent AI&#8221; has become a focus for companies, indicating that they&#8217;re taking AI safety seriously. While many governments and stakeholders agree on international norms and principles of AI transparency (see Figure 1), implementing the concept in practice is complicated. This blog will demystify common mechanisms that promote AI transparency. Principles of AI Transparency (from oecd.ai): to foster a general understanding of AI systems, to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems, including in the workplace, to enable those affected by an AI system to understand the outcome, and, to enable those adversely affected by an AI system to challenge its outcome based on plain and easy-to-understand information on the factors, and the logic that served as the basis for the prediction, recommendation or decision. Figure 1 Transparency in AI Development Impact Assessments Guaranteeing automated systems are safe before being launched is fundamental to responsible AI development. Throughout a model’s life cycle, developers and deployers of AI can conduct comprehensive impact assessments for evaluating the risks and benefits of their automated machines. These risk assessments inspect a variety of information such as the data sources used to train the models, the level of human involvement, security measures, ecological impacts, regulatory compliance, and more (see Figure 2). Many tech companies create their own AI Impact Assessments (AI-IAs) voluntarily in adherence to NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework and OSTP&#8217;s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Once completed, some companies, such as Salesforce, publish their AI-IAs results openly (omitting personally identifiable information), which can foster trust with stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and the public. Examples of Impact Assessment Questions (from cio.gov): Please describe the level of autonomy of the system and whether the system will be used to assist or replace human decision-making. Please describe the highest security classification of the input and training data used by the system. Is the algorithmic process difficult to interpret or explain?

An alliance of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and activists from diverse backgrounds helped craft its scale, scope, and promise to address the global AIDS crisis in a manner never attempted. Twenty years later, we know it as one of the most successful global health programs, with over 25 million lives saved. Responding to the severity of the AIDS crisis, PEPFAR took bold, decisive action that changed the trajectory of the pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and around the world. A recent BPC poll conducted by Morning Consult showed that 82% of voters believe it is important for the United States to take the lead on global health efforts, with 51% saying it is very important. These results add to the perplexity: Despite the staggering success of PEPFAR in saving lives and enhancing the U.S. global standing, reauthorization of this historically bipartisan program has stalled in Congress this year. PEPFAR stands as a testament to global cooperation and international compassion. Prior to PEPFAR, three million lives were lost each year to HIV/AIDs across the globe. The commitment from the United States to support this cause and increase partnerships with nations in need is one of the reasons so much progress was made. Now, as we confront the prospect of regressing, we risk losing the momentum gained and, more importantly, endangering the lives of millions. What is PEPFAR? On January 28, 2003, George W. Bush announced the creation of PEPFAR during his State of the Union address. In response, Congress swiftly enacted the program, securing near-unanimous support to allocate $15 billion in emergency funding for antiretroviral treatment, care for orphans, and the development of effective prevention interventions. As mentioned, PEPFAR has been wildly successful in decreasing HIV/AIDS infections and deaths in over 25 countries across the world. As a result of PEPFAR, 25 million people are alive today. Bipartisan Support PEPFAR has always enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Leaders from both sides worked together to pass the original legislation and have done so on every reauthorization since. The poll results support the continuation of this trend, with 52% of voters wanting to see Democrats and Republicans work together to continue the U.S.’s contributions to the global efforts against AIDs. “The program saves lives around the world, while exemplifying the constructive impact of investments in global health,” said former Senate Majority Leader and BPC Senior Fellow Dr. Bill Frist. “PEPFAR, from day one, has been widely bipartisan in support and scope.” Congress has the opportunity to act on this legislation and reauthorize this important program. Without bipartisan action from Congress, PEPFAR will not receive sufficient authorization to continue its global life-saving work. Global Health Leaders As previously noted, an overwhelming 82% of voters believe it is important for the United States to take the lead on global health efforts.

    "content": "On October 11, 2023, BPC’s J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity International, hosted a roundtable discussion in Atlanta. The purpose of the roundtable was to better understand and identify local challenges and opportunities for increasing the supply of affordable homes in Greater Atlanta, including the city of Atlanta and its surrounding counties. BPC has held similar discussions with local stakeholders in Boston, MA and Austin, TX. Representatives from local real estate developers, government, advocacy groups, and community-based organizations in Atlanta participated. To encourage an open dialogue, the roundtable was governed by the Chatham House Rule, meaning the discussion cannot be attributed to specific individuals or organizations. Below are key takeaways and considerations for policymakers informed by the housing affordability challenges in metro Atlanta. Background Atlanta is one of America’s largest and fastest-growing cities. Between 2010 and 2020, the Atlanta metro area gained more than 800,000 new residents, an increase of more than 15%, bringing the total population to more than six million residents. Growth continues: from April 2022 and April 2023, the 11 core counties in the metro region gained nearly 67,000 residents. Metropolitan Atlanta Source: Atlanta Regional Commission In the past year, the fastest rate of growth occurred in the City of Atlanta (2.8%), but each county also registered a population increase. The steady increase in population is being fueled by continued strong employment growth. Metro Atlanta’s job employment base increased 5.4% since the pandemic began in early 2020, the fifth highest in the nation. Home builders in greater Atlanta, like those in many cities with strong job growth, have struggled to keep pace with a rapidly expanding population. During the 2007-2008 financial crisis, permitting of all private-owned home types plummeted from between 5,000 and 6,000 approvals per month to a few hundred. While the permitting rate has slowly inched back up since then, it is still hovering at just over half the pre-crisis level. In 2021, metro Atlanta was about 105,000 homes short of meeting regional demand. Increased housing costs, in what was previously considered an affordable metro area, have put pressure on low- and middle-income families. Atlanta experienced some of the fastest-rising rents in the country in recent years. In October 2018, the average monthly rent in metro Atlanta was $1,497 for a one-bedroom apartment, but by October 2023, rent for the same type of apartment had risen to $2,068. The median-earning household in Atlanta would now have to spend more than 50% of its income to afford the median rent. Meanwhile, homeownership is increasingly out of reach. Between September 2018 and September 2023, the median home list price in the Atlanta metro rose 65%. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta measures the ability of a median-income household to absorb the annual cost of owning a median-priced home in its Home Ownership Affordability Monitor (HOAM) Index. In March 2022, the Atlanta metro fell below the HOAM Index’s affordability threshold for the first time in more than a decade, where it&hellip;",

Established by Congress in response to the Great Depression and currently consisting of 11 regional banks, the FHLB system provides low-cost loans to its 6,800 member institutions to facilitate mortgage lending and offers financing for affordable housing and community development projects. Last year, FHFA began a comprehensive review of the FHLB system to evaluate its performance over the past 90 years and to consider the role it should play going forward. Director Thompson discussed the agency’s findings from its report, FHLBanks at 100: Focusing on the Future, and identified areas of future work. A transcript of the event is available here. Check out some of the highlights: FHFA’s motivation for the FHLB review: Director Thompson shed light on FHFA’s rationale for undertaking the first comprehensive review of the Home Loan Bank System in decades. FHFA took a holistic view of the system and analyzed its dual mission of providing stable and reliable liquidity to members and supporting affordable housing and community development. FHFA also evaluated its own supervision and regulatory processes to see whether there were things that could be improved upon internally. Meeting the mission to remain a stable and reliable source of liquidity: The report addresses the bank failures of early 2023, when some FHLBanks were lenders of last resort for troubled member banks that didn’t have agreements in place to borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window to manage their short-term liquidity needs. Director Thompson emphasized having established processes in place to facilitate coordination among the Home Loan Banks, the Federal Reserve regional banks, primary federal regulators, and FHFA to ensure stability during market challenges. Significantly increasing the FHLBanks’ engagement in housing and community development: Director Thompson discussed strategies that FHLBanks could take to prioritize meeting their affordable housing and community development directives. She urged the banks to think creatively and consider expanding upon existing voluntary and/or pilot programs, further engaging community development financial institutions, and increasing small mortgage lending for small multifamily properties. The report includes a recommendation to double the FHLBanks’ required minimum contribution to their Affordable Housing Programs (AHP) (currently set at 10% of net earnings), an update that would require congressional approval. Ensuring FHLBank boards can address emerging risks: Director Thompson highlighted the FHLBank board governance requirements, which may warrant the inclusion of board members with specialized expertise given new risks to the financial and banking sectors. Addressing insurance and affordability challenges in the face of natural disasters: Director Thompson concluded the fireside chat by highlighting an issue outside the scope of the report but that has become an important topic in the housing industry: escalating property insurance costs due to natural disasters.

    "content": "HUD’s Community Development Block Grant, Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program supports long-term recovery efforts for disaster-impacted areas. Since its first use in 1993, the CDBG-DR program has awarded about $100 billion in long-term disaster recovery funding across the country. What States Have Received CDBG-DR Funding? Click here to download a PDF with total allocations for all states and territories. While the bulk of CDBG-DR funding has gone to a handful of states and territories, all but seven states have received at least some funding. Of those that have received CDBG-DR funding, 30 states and two territories have received at least $100 million since 2001. What Can CDBG-DR Spending Be Used For? CDBG-DR grants are flexible, allowing grantees to fund projects that best support their recovery needs. Spending for the program generally falls under one of the four categories below. Unlike for the traditional Community Development Block Grant program, HUD does not provide easily accessible data on total spending by activity, so it is unclear what percentage of spending goes to housing compared to infrastructure or community development. How Is CDBG-DR Different Than the CDBG Program? CDBG-DR is a source of supplemental funding for HUD’s traditional CDBG program. While CDBG-DR is the most common source of supplemental funding for CDBG, it largely operates as a separate program with some important distinctions, outlined below. What Role Does CDBG-DR Play in Relation to Other Disaster Assistance Programs? Given the constraints on FEMA and SBA assistance, communities generally have outstanding needs for long-term disaster recovery in the wake of devastating natural disasters. CDBG-DR provides important complementary value, targeting assistance to low- and moderate-income households in order to meet housing and community development needs, integrate mitigation and resilience, and reach communities that were unable to access sufficient support through FEMA and SBA. What Causes Delays for CDBG-DR Allocations? CDBG-DR has never been authorized in statute, so Congress must approve funding for each disaster through supplemental appropriations acts. HUD then must develop regulations for every appropriation. The process of disbursing funds—from when the disaster hits, to when impacted communities receive assistance—has many steps that can delay recovery efforts and result in varied timelines by disaster and grantees. For example, after earthquakes in Puerto Rico in late 2019, it took HUD until 655 days after the disaster declaration to make a CDBG-DR allocation. Read more about CDBG-DR timelines in BPC’s previous blog. Conclusion Permanently authorizing the CDBG-DR program would eliminate the lengthy delays often associated with developing and issuing the appropriation-specific Federal Register notices used to manage CDBG-DR funds, providing communities affected by disasters with greater certainty and predictability. BPC Action has more on legislative efforts to codify CDBG-DR. Read this fact sheet from BPC Action. Although detailed HUD data on CDBG-DR spending by activity is not readily accessible, there are estimates and analyses available regarding project spending allocations.

How is the digitization of lending impacting small businesses and consumers alike? On October 26, the Bipartisan Policy Center held a panel discussion to better understand the impact of technological change on credit underwriting and the economy of lending. Congressional Insights Rep. Zach Nunn (R-IA-3) kicked off the conversation by explaining the vital role he sees digitization playing in the financial services sector in his home district in Iowa. Nunn highlighted both the heightened risks and benefits that digitization can bring to our economy. He noted how digitization can provide benefits, such as increased access to credit and a fairer financial system, for the underbanked. However, Rep. Nunn cautioned that novel digitization is not without novel risks, such newly digitized services being used for fraud and other illicit activity. Nunn cited the work he has done in promoting the Financial Protection Act of 2023 to counter illicit activity and bad actors. Nunn also discussed artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential effects on the financial system. According to Rep. Nunn, Congress is up to the task of regulating AI. He added that Congress wants community banks to be adequately prepared to invest in AI, while ensuring privacy and discrimination laws are rightfully enforced. After hearing from Rep. Nunn, we were joined by FinRegLab’s Kelly Thompson Cochran, Enova International’s Joe DeCosmo, and Brookings Institution’s Aaron Klein for a panel moderated by BPC’s John Soroushian. The discussion began with panelists sharing their individual perspectives on how digitization will affect the credit economy in the near future. Digitization and Finance Cochran opened the discussion by exploring the significant impact of digitization and novel forms of data analysis on credit and lending in the U.S. She elaborated on the benefits that small businesses and underbanked individuals would reap through the application of innovative and novel data techniques in creditworthiness assessment. Klein echoed similar benefits but voiced concerns about the potential homogenization of credit factors raising the risk of excluding some individuals from the credit system. DeCosmo emphasized the importance of having humans “in the loop” when using AI and highlighting risks related to fraud and cybersecurity. Credit Analysis Basics and Risk-Based Pricing Klein explained how lenders use credit scores, which are derived from credit reports assessing individuals’ past credit usage, to make lending decisions. He went on to discuss how the Fair Credit Reporting Act governs credit data reporting, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act regulates how lenders allocate credit, requiring explanations for credit denials. Cochran stated that risk-based pricing enables lenders to charge higher interest rates on borrowers with a higher likelihood of default. She noted the debate between proponents, who argue it facilitates credit for riskier applicants, and opponents, who contend it may increase the likelihood of default for such applicants. DeCosmo supported risk-based pricing, stating it allows lenders, such as his firm Enova, to&hellip;",

Butter, too, has had its moments in and out of favor, and dietary trends like Keto and Paleo have waxed and waned. Some people swear by putting butter in their coffee, while others extol the benefits of overnight oats. Then there&#8217;s author Michael Pollan&#8217;s famous advice: &#8220;Eat Food. Not Too Much. Mostly Plants.&#8221; Sure, it’s a catchy phrase, but implementing it can be quite challenging. Knowing how to eat for nutrition can be a daunting task, especially when we’re bombarded with numerous, often contradictory messages about what’s considered healthy. The cost of this nutritional turmoil is staggering. As a country, we spend billions of dollars to manage chronic and life-threatening diseases that could be better controlled or even cured through a healthier diet. To better understand public perception regarding the relationship between nutrition and health, the Bipartisan Policy Center recently conducted a poll with Morning Consult that surveyed 2,000 U.S. adults about their personal health and dietary habits. The results reveal that 78% of respondents believed they were not very confused or not at all confused on what constitutes a healthy diet. Surprisingly, only 40% of those surveyed rated their health as excellent or very good. This striking disparity highlights a significant gap between people&#8217;s understanding of nutrition and its impact on their overall health. Given the abundance of information available to the public regarding various diets and what constitutes healthy eating, it becomes evident that medical professionals have a crucial role to play. To effectively bridge this gap and empower patients, health care providers must guide their patients toward nutritious eating habits. When we have questions about a broken bone or the flu, we turn to clinicians for guidance. However, when it comes to our overall health and nutrition, medical professionals, often lacking training in nutrition, may offer only vague advice to &#8220;eat better.&#8221; The poll findings support this, with 44% of participants indicating that their health care providers had not discussed best practices for eating a nutritious diet. In the absence of comprehensive guidance from medical professionals, we are left with fad diets and viral TikTok trends. Regrettably, nutrition education remains a scarce resource within health care training. A typical medical student receives fewer than 20 hours of nutrition education over their four-year medical school journey, with most of this instruction concentrated in the first year. This deficiency in nutrition education is mirrored in the training of other health care professionals. The findings from the aforementioned poll shed light on the pressing need for health care professionals to receive comprehensive training in addressing dietary concerns with their patients. An overwhelming 79% of adults firmly believe that doctors and other health care providers should undergo comprehensive training to effectively communicate and educate patients about nutritious eating. Notably, younger adults between the ages of 18 and 34 exhibit an especially strong desire for health care professionals to receive this training, underscoring the&hellip;",

Fortunately, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) included essential funding for CCUS facilities, DAC Hubs, and carbon storage infrastructure.  But as is the case with other forms of energy infrastructure, carbon management projects are now navigating a lengthy permitting process before construction activities can proceed. The Environmental Protection Agency’s Underground Injection Control (UIC) program manages the approval process for safe and permanent sequestration of CO2 deep underground, known as “Class VI” permits. In the 13 years since the Class VI program was established in 2010, a total of six permits have been approved, with only two leading to construction and operation. With the passage of the BIL and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the number of Class VI permits pending at EPA has significantly grown—with 169 applications received across 58 projects as of November 9, 2023. Figure 1: With policy support for carbon management from the BIL and IRA, pending Class VI applications for injecting CO2 underground have exponentially increased at EPA. EPA is taking steps to improve processing times and transparency for pending Class VI permits, including by releasing a dashboard with projected timelines for permits currently under review and expanding efforts for regulator training, but more needs to be done to ensure timely approvals. State primary authority, or “primacy,” is the ability for a state to carry out EPA’s authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act in approving a specific type of permit. This approach to processing permits has been used for decades for other classes of permits and has the advantage of leveraging state geologic survey expertise on a state’s unique geology when evaluating a permit application. The UIC program has granted primacy authority for many different classes of wells in 31 states and three territories, but only two states have primacy for Class VI permits today—North Dakota and Wyoming. As EPA expands staff expertise to process permits at the federal level, state primacy authority can play a complementary role to ensure project developers are not stuck waiting for permit approvals before continuing to develop a carbon management project. Fortunately, several states: Louisiana, Texas, West Virginia, and Arizona have taken steps toward primacy approval. Louisiana is the furthest along in the process, with EPA issuing a proposed rule for primacy in April 2023. The rule has been subject to public comment throughout this year and is expected to be finalized in the near future. It is worth noting that 33% of applications currently under review at EPA are from Louisiana, demonstrating the clear benefit of a dedicated approval system within the Bayou State. If primacy is granted, applicants in Louisiana will have the opportunity to resubmit their permit application for review under the new authority. Some applicants that have undergone significant reviews by EPA may choose to finish through the&hellip;",

    "content": "On Monday October 30, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order (EO) to enable the United States to seize the tremendous benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), while also managing risks. The EO rightly recognizes the need for immigration policy change to protect the U.S. lead in AI, with several provisions designed to attract and retain relevant talent. While the Biden administration&#8217;s efforts should be commended, in the realm of immigration policy an EO can only achieve marginal change within the boundaries of decades-old immigration law. For years the Bipartisan Policy Center has emphasized the necessity of congressional action for meaningful immigration reform. Without legislative change, there is a real possibility that the U.S. will lose the tech talent competition against China, risking its current status as the global leader in AI. Immigration Provisions in the AI Executive Order The EO is wide-ranging with several provisions designed to mitigate AI risks to Americans, enhance international collaboration on AI, and promote AI innovation and competition. At the heart of the efforts to boost America’s AI innovation are several immigration policy directives outlined in Section 5.1: Attracting AI Talent to the United States, summarized as follows: Making Visa Processing More Efficient: visa processing will be streamlined for noncitizens with relevant expertise or who seek to work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical and emerging technologies. This will include ensuring timely availability of visa appointments and allowing those already in the U.S. to renew their visas without having to depart the country and disrupt their work. Retaining Exchange Visitors with Critical Skills: consideration will be given to the criteria that designate the countries and skills on the Department of State’s Exchange Visitor Skills List. Specifically, the EO implies that efforts will be made to retain exchange visitors with skills “critical to the United States” by removing the requirement for these individuals to return to their home country for two years after completing their exchange visitor program. (Note: exchange visitors participate in programs often involving study, teaching, research, or professional training). Identifying and Attracting Top Talent in Critical Emerging Technologies: discretionary authorities will be used, and a program will be established to identify and attract top talent in AI and other critical and emerging technologies overseas and educate them on opportunities and resources for research and employment in the United States. A comprehensive guide will outline options for working in the U.S., and a public report will analyze how experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies have utilized the immigration system through the end of Fiscal Year 2023. Modernizing Immigration Pathways for Top AI Talent: policy changes will “clarify and modernize” immigration pathways for experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies including the O-1A (nonimmigrant) and EB-1 (permanent resident) visas for noncitizens of extraordinary ability; EB-2 green cards for advanced-degree holders and noncitizens of exceptional ability; and startup founders in AI and other critical and emerging technologies using the International Entrepreneur Rule.

Plus: a book review, a new academic society, and a new report on censored classrooms. Campus Happenings Colleges braced for antisemitism and violence. It’s happening. Jack Stripling | The Washington Post | October 31, 2023 The Biden administration is warning of an ‘alarming rise’ of antisemitic incidents on college campuses even as college administrators struggle to balance allowing students to voice their opinions and maintaining a safe community. As tensions rise, both Jewish students and Palestinian supporters are discontent with the current campus environment, with the former feeling threatened and the latter censored. Top Law Firms Signal They Won’t Recruit from College Campuses that Tolerate Antisemitism Matt Egan | CNN | November 3, 2023 More than two dozen prestigious law firms wrote a letter to top universities, including Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania, expressing concern over rising antisemitism. The firms suggested that students graduating from institutions that tolerate antisemitic harassment and threats of violence would not be considered for employment.

A recent International Energy Agency report found that technologies not yet available will deliver around one-third of the emissions reductions needed to meet this climate target, underlining the need for continued R&amp;D investments in the energy sector. In 2022, the United States contributed more than any other country to energy research and development, and has long led the world in R&amp;D. In 2019, America contributed 28% of total global spending on R&amp;D from both the public and private sectors, the largest by any country. Business spending on R&amp;D is crucial and drives investment. In fact, businesses invested more than three times as much in R&amp;D compared to the government. &nbsp; Source: AAAS.org To incentivize strong private sector investment in R&amp;D, since 1954, Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code allowed businesses to immediately deduct R&amp;D expenses in the year those expenses were incurred. However, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amended the law, eliminating the full and immediate deduction beginning in 2022. Companies now must spread out the deduction, also known as amortizing expenses, over five years. This leads to a less valuable tax deduction and higher tax burden for companies investing in R&amp;D. Here we explore the impacts of the R&amp;D tax deduction on the U.S. energy research ecosystem, the effects of the R&amp;D tax deduction on energy startups, and the current state of play in Congress to restore immediate expensing of R&amp;D spending. Impacts on Private Sector R&amp;D Spending Changes to R&amp;D tax expensing will have significant impacts on R&amp;D spending in the United States and the jobs those investments create. According to a study conducted by Ernst &amp; Young on behalf of the R&amp;D Coalition, the change requiring amortization will result in a reduction in U.S. R&amp;D spending of $4.1 billion annually in the first five years and $10.1 billion in the second five years and beyond. The same study shows that 23,400 jobs will be lost in each of the first five years and 58,600 in each of the second five years. This policy could diminish the United States&#8217; R&amp;D advantage as other countries do not require R&amp;D amortization. According to a recent analysis by the National Association of Manufacturers, this change makes the United States just one of two developed countries that requires amortization rather than immediate expensing. Meanwhile, China offers a “super-deduction” for R&amp;D that allows for 200% of the eligible R&amp;D expenses incurred by enterprises to be deducted. These impending reductions in R&amp;D spending come at a time when the innovations that can reduce emissions and generate clean energy are critical to meeting net-zero goals. Energy R&amp;D investments have led to important technologies like solar panels and electric vehicles, and continue to drive innovations in carbon capture&hellip;",

    "content": "For years, the Bipartisan Policy Center has advanced bipartisan policies important to American families. While Republicans and Democrats may differ on their approach to policies such as child care, paid family leave or the child tax credit, there is strong agreement that public policy should support parents and children. This bipartisan support extended to policies shaping the child welfare system. From the early 1980s into the 2010s, every major piece of child welfare legislation in Congress passed with significant bipartisan support. We saw similar approaches at the state, county, and city levels where policymakers allocated resources and enacted reforms to strengthen families and ensure children’s safety in a bipartisan way. Addressing the complex issues involved in child welfare—child maltreatment, foster care, adoption—means wrestling with some of the most sensitive and personal aspects of the core unit of American society: the family. Nevertheless, a bipartisan consensus historically underpinned child welfare policy. The longstanding challenges facing the child welfare system—problematic outcomes, resource sufficiency, agency coordination—have increasingly tested that consensus. Growing ideological divisions and sharply different perspectives on the proper scope of government intervention have added to the strain. Little agreement exists on what’s needed to remedy gaps in the child welfare system or even what the system’s purpose should be. After many months of intensive study of the child welfare landscape—including a national public opinion poll and scores of interviews with experts and advocates—BPC launched a Child Welfare Initiative to facilitate development and implementation of effective, bipartisan policies. Through the interviews and our research, we found that the child welfare field lacks a trusted convener to bring together different perspectives and identify shared priorities. Those we spoke with, from child welfare agency administrators and faith leaders to youth and foster parents with lived experience, agree on the challenges facing the child welfare system. They also agree that polarized and divisive rhetoric makes it difficult to find common ground on addressing these challenges and improving the system. Child Welfare Initiative BPC will focus on providing space for bipartisan discussion, consideration of evidence-based research, and constructive debate about policy options. Specifically, we seek to: Help federal policymakers better understand the common and unique challenges state and local child welfare agencies face in implementing federal policies. Create momentum for reforms at the state level in key areas including better differentiating poverty from neglect, improving front-end decision making, and supporting kinship care. Form working groups on selected issues to develop policy and practice guidance. Convene diverse experts to discuss challenges and build consensus on reform opportunities, including implementation of the 2018 Family First Prevention Services Act, addressing mental health challenges faced by parents and youth involved in child welfare, and opportunities to better maintain and support a quality workforce. Collect and disseminate information to support state and local system leaders. including research syntheses, descriptions of innovative policies and programs, summaries of federal guidance and examples of state plans.

A tangled web of federal and state policy guides both public agencies and private organizations. A groundbreaking Harris Poll conducted for the Bipartisan Policy Center—one of the few national surveys to gauge public attitudes toward the child welfare system—finds that Americans accept this complexity. They hold strong opinions about the system’s operations and parental responsibility but clearly prioritize both child safety and family unity. The fact that more than one-third of respondents (35%) have had some direct interaction with the child welfare system informs these nuanced views. Additional Downloadable Materials:  Top Line Data Sample Questionnaire Crosstabs 1 Crosstabs 2 National Report Georgia Report Ohio Report Key Highlights: Dual Mission Appreciated: Respondents see the child welfare system&#8217;s mission as two-fold: ensuring child safety and strengthening parents, with a nearly equal emphasis on protecting children (44%) and supporting families (51%). Faith in Family Improvement: A significant majority (74%) believe neglectful parents can provide safe and nurturing care for their children, with appropriate support. The same hope extends to abusive parents, with over half (53%) holding this view. Support for Kinship Care: Americans advocate for engaging extended family members when parents face challenges, with 90% favoring family involvement before considering foster care and 76% opposing adoption until all family care options are exhausted. Shared Responsibility: Two-thirds of participants (66%) agree that child safety and family assistance should be a shared effort between government and community/religious organizations. Balancing Act in Child Welfare Decisions: Americans lean towards erring on the side of caution, with 61% supporting investigations into reports of child neglect and abuse, even when there is uncertainty. Following an investigation, 53% favor keeping the child in the home even if the perceived risk of future harm is unclear; 39% say the child should be removed. At the same time, majorities of the public are concerned that decisions to intervene may sometimes reflect socioeconomic (73%) and racial (60%) biases. Timeline for Reunification: The public supports parents having sufficient time to meet requirements for family reunification, even if it means children spend more time in foster care. Just over half (57%) agree with the standard 15-month timeline, the suggested duration that agencies must give parents before moving on to other options. Neglect and Abuse Seen as Willful: Parenting is widely recognized as a difficult task, with 89% sharing that sentiment. Two thirds (65%) of respondents, however, believe that child neglect and abuse stem from deliberate parental actions rather than circumstantial factors. Nearly three-quarters (72%) attribute neglect to parents not wanting to care for their child; 8 in 10 attribute abuse to ill intent and desire to harm on the part of parents. Complex Views on Adoption and Cultural Preservation: While 47% of respondents agree that once a child is adopted from foster care, it is better to avoid contact with biological families, nearly three-quarters (71%) agree that, in general, adoptive parents should help adopted children maintain&hellip;",

    "content": "Americans are voting today in state-level elections across the country, but next year’s presidential race looms large on the horizon. While much of the coverage of the 2024 election will focus on candidates, how that election is administered is just as consequential. Here we lay out four under-the-radar election policy issues that have the potential to take center stage in 2024: election official turnover, longer waits for unofficial results, hand counting of ballots, and certification challenges. While 2020 showed that we can’t always predict what will surface during a presidential election year, each of these topics are key to making sure that the 2024 election is well-executed and that the results are trusted by a wide swath of Americans, no matter the result. Election official turnover Elections are chronically underfunded, highly complex logistical operations: experience matters. Election officials have long worked under the pressure of intense media scrutiny, tight deadlines, and inadequate funding. But in recent years, the job of an election official has gotten increasingly demanding. Burnout, compounded by persistent threats and harassment, is spurring an uptick in retirements and resignations that threaten the preservation of institutional knowledge among those responsible for upholding American democracy. New talent can heighten the risk of errors, glitches, and mistakes that—although they are unlikely to impact the legitimacy of results—still undermine voter confidence. Thankfully, our election procedures are intended to be resilient to administrative error, and election officials are working diligently to fill institutional knowledge gaps. BPC recently launched the Election Workforce Advisory Council which brings together election officials and workforce experts to improve and enhance election official recruitment, retention, and training. Learn more: Election Official Turnover Rates from 2000-2024 Longer waits for unofficial results False election narratives are most likely to spread in the hours or days between when polls close and when results are made clear. Therefore, it is imperative that ballots be tabulated quickly and accurately once voting has ended. Forty states allow election officials to process absentee ballots before Election Day, which expedites overall ballot tabulation and enables election officials to release unofficial results sooner. But a handful of key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, don’t allow preprocessing, needlessly delaying those election results. In 2020 and 2022, BPC warned that, with elevated levels of absentee voting and razor-thin margins, results might take longer than expected. We noted that the concept of “election night” may be obsolete—instead, “we must prepare for election week.” The public should prepare for the same in 2024. Learn more: Ballot Pre-processing Policies Explained Hand counting of ballots Ballot tabulators – the equipment that processes ballots to count votes – are the linchpin of accurate and timely election results. Yet, since 2020, at least 13 states and numerous local jurisdictions have attempted to replace them with hand counts. These efforts are based on the false premise that hand-counting ballots is the gold standard of accurate results. In reality, banning machine tabulation would undermine election integrity and sow distrust. If the prospect of waiting a few&hellip;",

    "content": "Introduction At a time when the United States is struggling with labor shortages, nearly 20% of prime-age adults—approximately 24 million Americans aged 25-54 — are not working. The vast majority of these people, roughly 21 million, are not even looking for work and are therefore “out of the labor force.” Only three million prime-age adults are seeking work and so are “unemployed”. A recent BPC-Artemis Strategy Group poll found that personal health and caregiving responsibilities are significant barriers to work for prime-age adults, with 72% of prime-age adults who are out of the labor force citing one of these as the main reason they are not working. This blog provides further insight that could inform policies aimed at bringing those who are not looking for work into the workforce. 1.   Prime-age adults not looking for work are more likely to be female, have children, and be older It is unsurprising that family caregiving is such an important barrier for prime-age adults not looking for work when 59%—an estimated 12 million people—are legal guardians of at least one child. This compares to just 41% of those who are looking for work. It is also striking that 66% of prime-age adults not looking for work—an estimated 14 million people—are female. In contrast, females make up only 38% of those prime-age adults actively looking for work. This disparity suggests that there are systemic or situational barriers preventing women from seeking employment. Addressing these barriers and encouraging more prime-age women to enter the labor force could significantly reduce the gap in labor force participation between males and females, and make for a more productive workforce. 2. While almost two-thirds of prime-age adults not looking for work may be open to working in the future, few have near-term plans to enter the workforce Thirty-seven percent of those not currently looking for work—or roughly 8 million people—do not plan to ever enter or return to the workforce. For these individuals, personal illness, injury, or disability was the most common factor contributing to their non-working status, with 63% citing this. Sixty-three percent of those not currently looking for work—an estimated 13 million people—may be open to working at some point in the future, but it may be quite some time until they do so. Only 13% (estimated at less than 3 million people) intend to work within a year, while 23% (roughly 5 million) do not plan to work for at least a year. For individuals who intend to enter the workforce in the future but are not looking for work now, our polling shows that personal health (60%) and caregiving responsibilities (59%) are the most prominent barriers to work. Acting now to remove these barriers may enable more prime-age adults to enter the workforce in the near-term. Further, 26%—estimated at over 5 million people—are unsure when they will begin working in the future. Our polling shows that these individuals are more likely than others to cite health issues as relevant (69%) but less likely to cite&hellip;",

    "content": "A bipartisan elections task force in Arizona released a set of pragmatic, forward-thinking policy recommendations this week that “offer a preview of what the future of Arizona&#8217;s election system could look like.” The task force, convened by Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ), highlights the transformative potential of collaborative policymaking in advancing election policy solutions amidst increasing political volatility. In a state like Arizona, where election administration has been the subject of intense partisan interest, it is imperative that policymakers attempt to ease conflict and take a bipartisan approach to maintaining secure and accessible elections. The Arizona task force arrived at its recommendations through a policymaking process that BPC strongly supports: prioritizing bipartisan cooperation and the expertise of election officials. The task force includes members of the Arizona legislature representing both political parties, with Gov. Hobbs, a Democrat, and former Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell, a Republican, serving as co-chairs. Additionally, nine of the 18 members have experience as state and local election officials. Bringing election practitioners together to discuss policy reforms transcends partisan motives and puts free and fair elections front and center. The Arizona task force proposes 16 changes to the state’s election policies, many of which have been endorsed by BPC’s Task Force on Elections in prior reports. This shared consensus underscores the pivotal role of collaborative policymaking in funding durable solutions: when bipartisanship meets practitioner expertise, tried-and-true best practices naturally arise. The reforms span numerous election administration topics. Below, we delve into three distinct areas—physical security, workforce, and voter registration—to show how the task force’s input enhanced each policy. &nbsp; Physical Security Many election facilities in Arizona are in aging buildings not designed for current security needs and practices. In a state facing elevated levels of threats and harassment of election officials, it is imperative that all facilities are able to protect the physical security of voting equipment, ballots, and election workers. Drawing on their direct experience with election facilities, the Arizona task force recommends creating a $12.5 million annual statewide fund to bolster physical security. Cities and counties could seek funding for security improvement projects, such as construction or renovation of election administration buildings. This funding structure keeps decision-making authority in the hands of local officials while increasing the pool of available resources—a unique approach to local and state power sharing that reflects the task force’s local perspective. &nbsp; Workforce Recruitment and Training Election offices nationwide are grappling with high turnover, risking the loss of institutional knowledge, especially as we approach the 2024 presidential election. The Arizona task force puts forth several strategies to cultivate an election workforce that can withstand high turnover. One recommendation is a paid fellowship program for recent graduates to acquire practical experience in election administration. This program aims to both assist county election administrators in fostering a sustainable talent pool and address immediate staffing shortages. The governor has dedicated $1 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to support this program. Additionally, the Arizona task force recommends a statutory revision to provide election&hellip;",

    "content": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have gained a lot of attention in 2023, but AI has been operating in various applications, from predictive text to virtual assistants on phones, for years. One recent survey found 23% of small businesses already use AI in some form, with 39% looking to adopt it in the near future, recognizing its economic benefits. However, navigating the norms and a fragmented patchwork of proposed and enacted state and federal regulations on AI remains a top concern for most small businesses. With AI technologies continuing to gain adoption in the market, it’s become the hot topic in Washington, sparking discussions on how AI benefits the small business economy while also considering ways it could impact small businesses and AI startups. Here are four implications for small businesses: To infinity and beyond! By incorporating AI into their operations, small businesses are harnessing its potential, especially in marketing and customer service, where it’s been most effective. AI has also been useful for small businesses when it comes to administrative automation, sales, and gathering business insights. Small business owners that use AI report that it not only helped their business operate more efficiently (82%) but has helped them to compete with larger firms (77%), limit cost increases (69%), and grow in challenging conditions (69%). AI startups developing models, services, and products that deploy AI technologies operate across various sectors. As AI technology continues to evolve, the use cases for small businesses are endless. There are incentives today that encourage greater innovation in this space, which is why the U.S. continues to be a leader in AI. Yet, many small businesses or startups are uncertain or unaware of the benefits, creating an education and technology literacy gap that must be addressed to ensure equitable opportunities. It’s all about the data. While AI technologies hold great potential for small businesses, there are some common concerns with the use of AI systems, including the security and privacy of the data used, both for small businesses and their consumers. To progress, AI systems require increasing amounts of data to improve utility and reliability. This creates privacy and security concerns over the amount of personal information available and fears around possible misuse—including bias against underrepresented groups. Policymakers need to address these concerns without stifling the growth of technology. With great power comes great responsibility. A growing emphasis on the concept of “responsible AI” highlights the importance of safety, transparency, and ethics in AI development and application. Proponents of responsible AI believe a widely adopted, comprehensive framework of best practices will build greater trust in and increase use of AI among organizations and individuals and ensure that AI utilization is reliable and fair. Major developers of AI products, like Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have already created their own blueprints or guidance for responsible AI. The White House and members of Congress have incorporated the responsible AI approach into their deployment of AI as well. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has proposed the SAFE Innovation Framework to&hellip;",

    "content": "Before the end of this year, lawmakers have the chance to pass bipartisan tax legislation, with the key parts of an agreement likely centering on an expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and a change in the tax treatment of research and development (R&amp;D) expenses for American businesses. BPC breaks down the current tax treatment of R&amp;D (called amortization) versus its historical treatment before 2022 (called full expensing). While returning to R&amp;D expensing would incur fiscal costs, the benefits that full expensing provides to U.S. businesses both large and small would catalyze job creation and economic growth in the years ahead. How Does the Tax Code Treat R&amp;D? From 1954 through 2021, businesses could deduct the full amount of an R&amp;D investment from their taxable income in the year they made the investment. For example, if a business invested $100 in R&amp;D in 2021, it could deduct $100 from taxable income, reducing its taxes by $21 in this simple example ($100 multiplied by the 21% statutory corporate income tax rate). This is called full expensing. Under a provision in the 2017 tax law, businesses were required to amortize, or spread out, their deductions over five years starting in 2022. For example, if the business above invested $100 in R&amp;D in 2022, it could only deduct $20 from taxable income over each of the next five years (2022-2026), reducing its taxes by just $4.20 per year. Under R&amp;D Full Expensing Under R&amp;D Amortization Amount of R&amp;D Investment $100 $100 Deduction in Year of Investment $100 $20 Tax Reduction in Year of Investment $21 ($100 * 21%) $4.20 ($20 * 21%) Dozens of lawmakers in both parties are supporting legislation to restore full expensing for R&amp;D and end the five-year amortization requirement. The Case for Full Expensing Full R&amp;D expensing can grow the economy. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) wrote in July that restoring R&amp;D expensing will decrease the cost of R&amp;D, thereby incentivizing businesses to expand their investments. The Tax Foundation estimated that permanent R&amp;D expensing would increase both gross domestic product and wages. R&amp;D expensing can also incentivize private investment, especially among businesses that might otherwise be reluctant to invest in R&amp;D. While R&amp;D can be risky for businesses, such investments are vital to America’s global competitiveness. The pharmaceutical sector is one example, where even drugs that reach the clinical trial phase (after years of costly R&amp;D) only get approved and reach the market around 10% of the time. R&amp;D expensing is no less legitimate than other business expenses such as salaries, office rent, and materials that are fully and immediately deductible. What’s the Proper Tax Treatment of R&amp;D? Congress should restore full expensing. This policy would grow the economy, treat R&amp;D like the legitimate business expense it is, and restore the tax treatment that R&amp;D received for decades. Both Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO) have expressed a willingness to negotiate a year-end tax deal on&hellip;",

    "content": "As Congress works to pass the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) this year, both House and Senate bills incorporate measures to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign mineral supply chains. This focus on securing critical mineral supply chains is essential to fortify the country against future domestic and geopolitical challenges. This blog is your guide to the critical mineral provisions in the House and Senate versions of the FY2024 NDAA. Dependence on fragile critical mineral supply chains dominated by adversarial sources threatens national defense, economic growth, and the energy transition. Recognizing this pressing challenge, Congress in previous legislative sessions worked across the aisle to bolster domestic critical mineral production and diversify sourcing through key provisions in the Energy Act of 2020, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the CHIPS and Science Act. Breakdown of the critical mineral provisions in the IIJA and CHIPS and Science Act: Getting Serious About Critical Materials: the IIJA and Energy Act of 2020 Deploying a Domestic Mining Workforce with the CHIPS and Science Act The FY2024 NDAA House and Senate provisions further strengthen supply chain security by leveraging the Department of Defense.

Senate Bill Text Senate Report Language House Bill Text House Report Language National Defense Stockpile Background: The DOD-managed National Defense Stockpile stores strategic materials for military, industrial, and civilian use, safeguarding against foreign supply chain disruptions. It aims to boost domestic sources, like critical mineral production and processing. In 2022, the DOD agreed to allow the Department of Energy to tap the stockpile for minerals vital to the electrical grid and clean technologies. FY2024 House NDAA Bill Provisions Multi-year Procurement Authority for Domestically Processed Rare Earth Elements (Sec. 181) Allows the National Defense Stockpile to enter into long-term procurement contracts with domestic rare earth element (REE) processing and recycling projects.

Chambliss is a co-chair alongside former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of BPC’s Farm and Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force. The task force issued 24 recommendations focused on finding new ways to incentivize farming, ranching, and forestry practices that deliver both economic and climate benefits. During the event, Chair Stabenow thanked the task force for its work and noted that the majority of its recommendations will be included in the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill—which is passed every five years and sets national agriculture, nutrition, conservation, and forestry policy—encompasses a wide range of financial and technical assistance programs for farmers and forest landowners. The Inflation Reduction Act also provided new funding for agricultural conservation. Chair Stabenow stressed that these popular conservation programs are a true win-win for farmers and the environment. While there are still Farm Bill challenges to be addressed, Chair Stabenow said she seeks to preserve the climate-focused attributes of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) conservation funding as she works with her counterparts towards a bipartisan bill. She would like to either include the IRA funding in the Farm Bill baseline or maintain the funding as set out by the IRA. Chair Stabenow also pushed for a “moonshot” in agricultural research to tackle global challenges facing food security and the importance of centering agricultural research in general discussions on research and innovation. By emphasizing conservation programs, climate opportunities, and innovation priorities, Chair Stabenow spoke to the tremendous potential for a bipartisan Farm Bill to address the needs of America’s farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. This is aligned with the BPC task force’s policy recommendations calling for a rapid scale-up of farm- and forest-based carbon solutions. Beyond helping us meet U.S. climate goals, farm- and forest-based carbon solutions will stimulate investment in rural communities and bolster the long-term resilience and productivity of America’s natural and working lands. A bipartisan Farm Bill is a tremendous opportunity to advance our agriculture and forestry policy for the benefit of all Americans. Watch the full event recording",

    "content": "The Brief Digital services taxes (DSTs) are levied on multinational enterprises providing goods or services online and have been proposed or enacted in at least 38 countries worldwide. Companies subjected to multiple DSTs—many from the United States—face double taxation and significant revenue loss, yielding bipartisan concern from U.S. lawmakers. Pillar One of the OECD’s two-pillar global agreement aims to create a global consensus on nexus issues and the taxation of digital services by reallocating a portion of the global profits of high-revenue, highly profitable multinational companies to the countries in which those companies operate, thus eliminating the need for DSTs. Lawmakers must consider the economic and political ramifications of action (or inaction) on Pillar One, and prioritize policies that balance growth, equity, and efficiency with a rapidly changing digital economy. In the 21st century digital economy, countries are increasingly seeking to redefine the way they tax businesses providing goods or services within their borders. More and more global consumers are engaging in work, advertising, and marketplaces online, and with worldwide e-commerce retail sales projected to increase by almost $3 trillion from 2021 to 2026, many countries have sought to tax companies that offer these online services regardless of where the companies or their employees are located. In lieu of international consensus on how to tax digital commerce, multiple countries have adopted digital services taxes (DSTs). These taxes are typically levied on gross revenues from large companies providing goods or services online and amassing hundreds of millions of dollars in global revenues, with a significant portion of those revenues originating from the implementing country itself. DSTs have enabled countries to levy taxes on business activity generated within their borders, even in cases where the company’s headquarters, employees, or assets are not located within the country levying a DST. U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree that these unilateral taxes could disproportionately harm American companies since many of the entities subject to the tax are U.S.-based. A Short History of DSTs Peru enacted one of the first DSTs in 2007—a 30% withholding tax on payments for digital services made to non-resident businesses. Since then, 38 additional countries have proposed or enacted some form of a DST, including major economies such as France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Existing DSTs range from 1% to 30% of a company’s revenue, bringing in additional funds to the implementing countries. The increasing popularity of DSTs on the international stage has raised alarms in the U.S. as a result of being “unreasonable and discriminatory and burdening or restricting U.S commerce.” Source: Joint Committee on Taxation Note: Multiple taxes on digital multinational companies exist, contingent upon the extent of a company’s economic presence and the nature of operations they engage in (such as advertising, streaming, online marketplaces, etc.) and the collection and sale of user data. “DAT” refers to a Digital Advertising Tax; “DST” refers to a Digital Services Tax; “Digital PE” refers to a Digital Permanent Establishment or expanding the traditional definition of permanent establishment&hellip;",

    "content": "While Congress managed to avert a shutdown (at least for the time being), vital resources for addiction care have lapsed. Thanks to a lack of reauthorization by September 30, many programs authorized in the SUPPORT Act now sit unfunded. As a result, patient access to addiction care hangs in the balance. It’s time for policymakers to step in and act. What is the SUPPORT Act? The Substance-Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act changed the federal approach to treating addiction. This bipartisan law represents a comprehensive response to the opioid crisis public health emergency. It directed federal resources toward prevention, education, coverage, treatment, and law enforcement programs. Since being enacted, the SUPPORT Act has increased access to services by relaxing eligibility and enrollment for vulnerable populations, expanded authorization for new Medicaid demonstration programs, and enhanced prescription drug oversight. The act also allocated funding for critical community-based treatment and recovery programs while requiring expanded coverage for FDA-approved medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD). How has the overdose crisis changed? Since 2018 when the SUPPORT Act was initially passed and signed into law, the nature of the drug overdose crisis has changed considerably. Overdose deaths increased by around 30% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, overdose deaths were driven by increases in prescription opioid pain medications. However, now these deaths are climbing because of increases in the supply of illicit fentanyl. What’s noteworthy is that this rise is no longer confined to individuals with diagnosable substance use disorders; it now extends to first-time and casual drug users as well. These evolving dynamics have led to stark inequities among people of color—overdose death rates rose by 81% between 2019 and 2021 in both Black and Native Americans, compared with just 40% among white Americans during that same timeframe. What’s at stake? With the nation once again exceeding 100,000 overdose deaths in 2022, it is crucial that policymakers reauthorize the SUPPORT Act and respond to the changing needs of the drug overdose crisis. The SUPPORT Act of 2018 shifted the nation’s approach to the opioid crisis by addressing it as a public health issue and bringing a whole-of-government response to fill service gaps across the health care system and within the community. Despite the opioid crisis having the same federal designation—a public health emergency—as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a weaker federal response. Congress now has the responsibility to remedy this by coordinating and assessing how those investments and policies have fared in the intervening five years, and evaluating what must be changed to meet the evolving nature of the crisis. In our 2022 report, Combating the Opioid Crisis: “Smarter Spending” to Enhance the Federal Response, BPC provided recommendations to optimize federal spending to fight the opioid crisis. Congress can use recommendations like these to determine how their investments can yield better outcomes and ultimately prevent more lives from being lost. Long-term success requires longer-term investments across the continuum of&hellip;",

    "content": "Technology is driving an evolution in U.S. health care. The availability and use of digital health technologies have increased exponentially since the COVID-19 pandemic, and artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the patient experience. In developing the federal response to new and emerging technologies, policymakers will need to re-evaluate regulatory structures to ascertain whether they account for the complexities of these innovations. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Health Program is actively engaged in this dialogue and recently submitted a series of public comments and responses to requests for information. We discuss the need for comprehensive health data privacy reforms, strategies to ensure access to safe medical technologies, and guardrails to maximize benefits and minimize risks associated with AI in health care. Below is a summary of these comments. Increasing Patient Access to At-Home Use Medical Technologies (August 2023) BPC responded to the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) request for public comments on increasing patient access to at-home use medical technologies. We draw upon our work to develop evidence-based federal policy recommendations for the effective use of remote monitoring technologies. Our comments focus on the need for transparency and ensuring communities with access barriers can utilize these devices. BPC recommends that Congress direct the FDA to promulgate a rule clarifying that remote monitoring device labels should include performance characteristics. Providers and patients need information on these devices—including how they work across races, ethnicities, and sexes—to gauge their clinical value and appropriate use. We propose creating a list of legally marketed remote monitoring devices or a searchable database to simplify access, eliminate counterfeit device risks, and ensure proper utilization. Many Americans grapple with limited broadband, including 46 million individuals living in rural and frontier communities. To facilitate widespread access, the FDA should ensure remote monitoring devices are capable of store-and-forward technology—the electronic transmission of medical information to a practitioner at a distant site for use outside of a live patient interaction. Additionally, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should allow store-and-forward technologies for billing codes related to remote monitoring and provide guidance on how often patients should transmit data to providers. Health Breach Notification Rule (August 2023) BPC submitted comments in response to the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) proposed rule regarding health data. In the absence of an overarching federal privacy law, BPC supports the FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule and the proposed changes to safeguard personal health information by encompassing a wider range of data and entities. The proposed changes would add wellness products—such as sexual health, sleep, and diet apps—to the definition of health care services or supplies. This broader definition is more consistent with the type of intimate personal information users disclose in health applications. BPC requests additional clarification by the FTC, including to: clearly articulate that there is now little to no gap through which actors can legally share personal health data; ensure the definition of personal health record identifiable information clearly includes data from wellness products; and provide safe-harbor rules around cybersecurity.

    "content": "Introduction In over thirty states across the country, state legislatures are seeking to regulate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives on college campuses. Likewise, boards of regents, the bodies that govern public university systems, are taking action. Regulations targeting DEI initiatives can be grouped into several categories: restricting classroom teaching about DEI; prohibiting the use of diversity statements in appointments, promotions, and tenure (APT); banning mandatory DEI training; and restricting DEI offices. Some complain that these regulations infringe on academic freedom and free expression on college campuses, while others claim that the DEI initiatives themselves constitute the threat. These regulations are hardly the first time that governing bodies’ actions have touched free expression and academic freedom. During the last decade, state governing bodies have banned free speech zones at schools, regulated antisemitic speech, clarified harassment policies, and more. What is new is the bodies’ focus on DEI. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Academic Leaders Task Force argues that it is possible for college administrators to harmonize DEI, academic freedom, and free expression, stating in its report, Campus Free Expression: A New Roadmap: “Addressing the perceived tension between diversity, equity, inclusion, and free expression is an essential rhetorical and strategic task for campus leaders.” That said, commitments to DEI and to free expression and academic freedom frequently are perceived to conflict. That perception may explain, in part, the public sentiment that colleges are limiting academic freedom and free expression: just 36% of Americans express confidence in higher education, and 79% of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents (along with 17% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents) attribute their lack of confidence to “professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom.” Colleges can respond to these concerns with campus surveys of students and their views about whether they feel politically pressured by their professors. Publicly addressing the perceived conflict between DEI, academic freedom, and free expression could be another opportunity to rebuild public confidence. In response to new regulations on DEI initiatives, colleges and universities have turned to an array of new options, including assessing the scope of their DEI policies, working toward transparent relationships with legislators and boards of regents, and proactively adjusting their practices to acknowledge academic freedom and free expression concerns. I. Restricting Classroom Teaching About DEI States seeking to regulate discussions of race and sex on college and university campuses include Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. National attention has focused on Florida’s regulations, where Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) signed legislation that prohibited general education courses at public universities from “distort significant historical events or includ a curriculum that teaches identity politics.” Gov. DeSantis stated that the legislation will end DEI initiatives which “promote dangerous political and social activism,” including “theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States.” On the other hand, critics say the Florida bill infringes on academic freedom, the right of faculty to research, teach, and speak freely without fearing&hellip;",

    "content": "Claudia Goldin, the 2023 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, laid the foundation for our understanding of caregiving’s implications for women in the workforce. Her research delved into the changes in women’s labor force participation after welcoming a child, elevated causes of the gender wage gap, and revolutionized our thinking on balancing careers and families and the benefits of paid family leave. Her work further provides a clear lens to tailor public policy interventions. Women Balancing Work and Caregiving Goldin’s work documents the effects of the “motherhood penalty” on women in the workforce. Despite the steady increase in women’s labor force participation over the past 70 years—with today’s labor force participation rate of prime-age (traditionally defined as those aged 25-54) women near an all-time high—the time demands of caregiving and pay inequity still disproportionately fall on women. In fact, a recent BPC-Artemis Strategy Group poll found that 50% of prime-age women not currently looking for work cite caregiving responsibilities as the main reason they are not employed. Goldin not only highlighted how women earn less than men following the birth of their first child—a phenomenon referred to as the parental gender pay gap–but that fathers are often rewarded at the same time. Today, this gender pay gap remains a top issue for women in deciding to return to work following childbirth. When compared to a wide range of potential workplace benefits, women out of the workforce rank paid family and medical leave (15%) as nearly as important as compensation (16%) when identifying the single most important benefit for returning to work. As such, access to policies such as paid family leave can also be a solution to help curb the motherhood penalty. Paid Family Leave Reduces Barriers for Women at Work An analysis published by Goldin, Kerr, and Olivetti in January 2020 showed that firm-provided paid parental leave benefits greatly increased over the past two decades. These trends suggest that employers see the value of paid leave benefits for workers, and in a tight labor market, recognize that these benefits can help attract and retain top talent. Further expanding access to paid family leave would help many women enter or return to the workforce. The weight of research shows that paid family and medical leave increases labor force participation, especially among women. Studies have found that women who take paid family leave after giving birth are 40% more likely to return to work than those without the benefit. The workforce benefits of paid leave also have long-term implications. Goldin’s research shows that, a decade after childbirth, the labor force participation rate of mothers who used paid family leave is 82%, compared to 64% among moms who quit their jobs during pregnancy. Conclusion Goldin’s research shed light on the gender disparities baked into the labor market that shape employment and economic outcomes, transforming how we think about women in the workforce. Because of her work, economists and policymakers are attuned to the barriers women face and can craft family-focused policies&hellip;",

Without intervention, we risk reaching a point at which elections are administered and staffed by a wave of new officials grappling with the complexities of their role while operating under intense public scrutiny. Even for experienced officials, new challenges require new competencies. Onboarding new workers and preparing existing workers for new challenges will be critical in ensuring that elections are trusted and trustworthy, even as threats shift and grow. Despite high turnover, we don’t have good data on just how many election officials have left, how turnover rates have changed over time, or how they compare to other public service positions. And despite a renewed focus on training and development, little research has been done on what training approaches and curricula are most effective. Creating a sustainable elections workforce in the long term will require investing now in research that helps us better understanding the current landscape to find actionable, evidence-based solutions. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Elections Project and The Elections Group (TEG) have made $500,000 available to support research projects that generate new findings on election administration recruitment, retention, and training.

    "content": "This blog is the first in a series highlighting local approaches to improve housing choice for low-income families, incentivize family self-sufficiency, and achieve greater cost effectiveness in HUD spending through the Moving to Work demonstration program. Public housing authorities (PHAs) promote self-sufficiency as part of their Moving to Work (MTW) programs by designing initiatives to assist families to enroll in educational institutions, secure stable employment, and transition from rental subsidy to paying their household’s full housing costs. This blog explores three initiatives that help families reach their goals in areas that can boost their long-term economic and financial outcomes: purchasing a home, starting a small business, and strengthening their educational foundation. Paving Pathways to First-Time Homeownership—Baltimore, MD The fifth largest public housing authority in the country, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC) assists almost 20,000 families through its housing choice voucher and public housing programs. HABC has been promoting homeownership as a path to self-sufficiency since as early as 1994, when the agency developed a homeownership program in collaboration with residents, housing counseling agencies, and lenders. The program was implemented to give families a pathway to “become independent and self-sufficient while building equity in a home of their own.” Today, HABC’s Moving to Work homeownership program offers benefits to its residents, who are supported in their efforts to purchase their first homes; the housing authority, which repurposes vacant housing stock; and local Baltimore neighborhoods that are revitalized and invested in. HABC’s MTW Homeownership Program was reactivated in FY2020 and modifies HUD’s Section 32 and Section 8 Homeownership programs, two of several resources available to PHAs to help residents become homeowners. Under HABC’s MTW Homeownership program, select scattered site public housing units within Baltimore are available for purchase by eligible housing choice voucher and public housing participants as well as other eligible applicants. Under the program, low-income homebuyers can receive funds for closing costs (matched by HABC up to $5,000 based on household need) as well as apply for non-cash, non-interest bearing second mortgages up to 25% of the after-rehab appraised value of the property. Eligible public housing first time homebuyers may receive up to $10,000 in down payment assistance (participants must complete homeownership counseling from a HUD-certified Housing Counseling Agency). HABC allows for the disposition of its scattered sites to approved community partners who agree to resell the homes to HABC’s public housing residents. In FY2021, HABC added a new component to its program by funding a limited amount of Special Homeownership Vouchers set aside for low-income households who purchase an eligible scattered site home through the program. As with HUD’s traditional homeownership programs, once families have purchased a home, their homeownership costs are partially subsidized by the housing authority for the length of the program term (10 years or 15 years for 20+ year mortgages). To facilitate the transition out of assisted homeownership, the housing authority added a five-year, decelerated assistance term onto the homeownership program period.

    "content": "The Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration is a nationwide program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that allows selected public housing authorities (PHAs) to develop and test innovative, locally designed strategies to meet specific needs of the community. The MTW program exempts these PHAs from many voucher and public housing rules and offers flexibility on how federal funds can be utilized. Although MTW housing authorities must remain in compliance with certain statutory requirements, they may take advantage of several flexibilities that the program offers if doing so is in pursuit of one or more of its three objectives: Reduce costs and achieve greater cost-effectiveness in federal expenditures; Give incentives to families with children where the head of household is working, seeking work, or preparing for work by participating in job training, educational programs, or programs that assist people to obtain employment and become economically self-sufficient, and Increase housing choices for low-income families. HUD requires MTW housing authorities to track the ways their agencies make use of the program’s flexibility and report on outcomes tied to the three statutory objectives—reducing costs, improving self-sufficiency, and increasing housing choice. This blog series explores the innovations that PHAs have adopted with the enhanced regulatory flexibility provided by MTW. A Stable Home Opens Doors: Encouraging Self-Sufficiency Among Low-Income Families Choice and Progress: MTW Public Housing Authorities Expand Housing Options for Families  About Moving to Work The MTW demonstration was developed in response to critiques that HUD programs did not give grantees the ability or resources to tailor programs to the needs of local communities, limited housing choice for low-income households, and did not  encourage self-sufficiency. Congress authorized 39 MTW agencies under the 1996 Appropriations Act, and 100 additional housing authorities as part of the MTW Expansion under the 2016 Appropriations Act. PHAs participating in the MTW Expansion were selected and placed in cohorts, which HUD setup to evaluate the impact of specific innovations, such as stepped and tiered rents, incentives for landlords to participate in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, and pathways to asset building. In 2021, HUD rescinded its section notice seeking applicants for a cohort to test work requirements, citing conflict with the current economic realities and needs of low-income families. MTW PHAs have been implementing creative solutions to the very real housing affordability crisis their residents have faced for decades. At the same time, this has given HUD and external research organizations the opportunity to continually evaluate the MTW program and better understand what works. Some successful MTW innovations have informed large-scale regulatory reforms rolled out nationwide, including inspection requirement updates in the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization Act (HOTMA) and COVID-19 emergency waivers. The program enables the housing industry to diverge from a “one-size-fits-all” approach to affordable housing and allows housing authorities to make informed decisions dictating the use of their resources to serve the vulnerable residents in their local housing markets.",

    "content": "After a pandemic slump, airline travel has returned stronger than ever, with TSA measuring the highest single day volume of passengers in U.S. history this summer. Air travel is only expected to increase: according to an FAA report, annual domestic boardings are expected to rise from 800 million in 2023 to nearly 1.4 billion over the next 20 years. Accommodating this expected rise in demand for air travel will require modernizing and enhancing our nation’s airports to expand capacity. While Congress considers FAA reauthorization legislation—which has historically passed every five years—to support federal investments in airport infrastructure, airports also continue to leverage private sector partnerships to deliver needed infrastructure projects and prepare for the future of air travel. Unlike in some countries, fully private ownership of airports is rare in the United States. While FAA’s Airport Investment Partnership Program permits the sale or lease of public airports to private entities, very few airports have participated. Notably though, the city of Avon Park, FL, just recently submitted an application to lease its local airport to a private airport operator. Public-private partnerships (P3s), on the other hand, are far more common. P3s are long-term contracts where a private entity assumes certain responsibilities for a public asset, such as building, financing, operating, and maintaining it. P3s allow local governments to transfer the financial risk involved with transportation projects to private partners while also incorporating private sector innovations and investment, all without fully privatizing public infrastructure. Most travelers likely do not pay close attention to how infrastructure projects like airports are financed and built. Yet P3s are responsible for a substantial number of airport projects today—both large and small. Some P3s are established to build and operate entire airports, while other P3s are large-scale, complex projects to replace and redevelop entire terminals. However, they also include a diverse range of smaller projects at airports of all sizes and for a variety of different airport functions, including water supply and parking. See below for a summary of projects proposed or completed since our 2017 update on the status of airport P3s in the U.S. Conclusion Airport P3s have shown both promise and challenges across the United States. While some completed projects demonstrate the potential benefits of private investments and management in airport infrastructure development, other projects highlight the importance of careful planning, budgeting, and risk management in a P3. In the wake of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), local governments have greater resources for infrastructure projects. As a result, P3s may be overlooked as a model for developing new projects, because local governments often see them as a useful means to finance projects only when they are cash-strapped. However, airports should still consider P3s as a valuable option for low-risk, cost-efficient, high-quality projects. P3s can help local governments reduce their exposure to risk of projects going over budget and alleviate some of the burden of design, development, and long-term management of airports.

    "content": "Today’s labor force participation rate of prime-age women, traditionally defined as those aged 25-54, is 77.6%—a full rebound from COVID-era levels and exceeding pre-pandemic levels. A BPC-Artemis survey of non-working prime-age adults, defined as those aged 20-54 who are not full-time students, reveals that, despite recent gains, women continue to face barriers to entering and remaining in the workforce. Among women who are not currently looking for work—and thus not in the labor force—caring for children is a leading factor in their decision not to seek employment. The survey suggests that improved family-friendly policies, like child care benefits and paid leave, are crucial to attracting and retaining women in the workforce. Finding 1: Prime-age women are substantially more likely than men to remain out of the workforce due to caregiving responsibilities, primarily to care for children full-time. Note: Responses from prime-age women not in the labor force. Fifty percent of prime-age women who are not in the labor force cited caring for others as the main reason they are not working, with 48% specifically citing caring for children full-time. Prime-age men not in the labor force were much less likely to report caregiving responsibilities (9%), such as caring for children full-time (5%), as their main reason. Finding 2: Prime-age women agree that access to affordable, quality child care is a critical workforce support, particularly for women with young children. Note: Responses from prime-age women not in the labor force for child-related reasons. Child care concerns, specifically related to the cost and quality of care, are major factors preventing women from working. Among women not looking for work who indicated that caring for children or the lack of family-friendly benefits are reasons they are not in the labor force, 53% cited the cost or quality of child care as a factor in their decision. Moreover, when asked about specific characteristics of child care, 88% of women not looking for work indicated that trust in their local child care provider(s) is the most important characteristic when considering whether to enter or return to the labor force. Other important characteristics to women not looking for work include cost (86%), choice in the type of child care (78%), and access to infant or toddler care (65%). The high response rates for each of these characteristics suggest that trust, cost, and choice in type of child care can all play a significant role in incentivizing women to participate in the workforce. Finding 3: Most women caring for children reported that access to paid parental leave, among other benefits, would make them more likely to enter or return to work. Note: Responses from prime-age women not in the labor force for a child-related reason. Many workers still lack access to paid parental leave to care for a newborn, adopted child, or foster child. Only 47% of prime-age women not in the labor force had access to any type of paid leave benefits at previous jobs. Prime-age women who are not in the labor force because they are caring for&hellip;",

    "content": "Amid the current debate in Washington, DC, around U.S. competitiveness issues, BPC has been crossing the nation to gather local perspectives through roundtable discussions with private and public sector leaders. One of these conversations included a stop in Pueblo, Colorado to hear how competitiveness is defined and supported in the region. Why Pueblo? “Rural communities have to be innovative because we just don’t get the resources that urban communities get—change has to be driven from right here.” – Roundtable Participant Pueblo County, historically a leader in steelmaking and manufacturing, is at the center of industry growth and innovation in southern Colorado. Increased focus on economic development, with new initiatives centered around improved infrastructure, revitalized housing, and support for new business ventures, has fostered a pro-business environment in the region. From Fortune 500 companies to homegrown start-ups across industries—including health and wellness, advanced manufacturing, aerospace and defense, infrastructure engineering, and outdoor recreation—entrepreneurs are drawn to the region’s extraordinary quality of life and future-focused business innovation. BPC attended Southern Colorado (SOCO) Start-Up Week to speak directly with local entrepreneurs. Innovation and Investment Starts at Home “Southern Colorado bubble. All the money stays up north, so how do we get involved in those grants and economic development funding?” – Roundtable Participant Colorado is one of the most attractive states to start or own a business. Nevertheless, not all regions share in this success, particularly communities in the southern corridor and “outside of who are left off the economic engine.” Further, participants representing the e-commerce industry expressed concerns about the significant administrative burdens associated with the tax code. To facilitate growth statewide, participants encouraged increased infrastructure development, which starts with fixing “regional and local supply chains to put technology in place” that can help businesses thrive right at home. Nationwide efforts, such as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, are intended to help catalyze economic development and innovation. Roundtable participants were cautiously optimistic about these types of federal initiatives to support domestic innovation. One participant remarked, “long-term it could create the supply chain that will lead into different communities, but it’s going to take a long time,” and only if these initiatives bring about both direct local investment and similar changes in the workforce. While federal funding to spur industry growth is crucial, participants were quick to note that it often imposes preferential treatment for certain sectors and regions, thereby creating additional barriers to local growth. One participant noted, “when industry was less impacted by the federal government, industry thrived.” There was an overarching sentiment that Coloradan entrepreneurs craved the freedom to be creative and competitive in local and national markets, but federal bureaucracy can unintentionally leave them “in many ways, with hands tied behind backs.” Further, statewide goals do not always align with the industry needs of rural communities, leaving them to create their own success with less financial resources and administrative support than urban centers. Ensuring investments equally target legacy sectors like manufacturing and agriculture, alongside technology,&hellip;",

In the eleventh hour, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the government funded through November 17, narrowly avoiding government shutdown. We expect to see a continued focus from Members of Congress on passing appropriations bills to fully fund the government before the CR expires. Other “must pass” bills like the Farm Bill and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) won’t move until the funding issue is resolved. DOE is Set to Improve its SBIR and STTR Programs In July, the Energy Department’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs announced some exciting new changes that align with AEIN’s recommendations to help this important program achieve its full potential. This includes support for underrepresented entrepreneurs, an investor pitch program, and more. OMB Issues Final Guidance on Made in America Provisions Last month, the Office of Management and Budget issued final guidance on “Buy American” requirements for all infrastructure projects that use federal financial assistance. The final guidance requires preferences for American-made steel and iron products, manufactured products, and construction materials. IRS Releases Interim Sec. 174 R&amp;D Tax Deduction Guidance Earlier this month, the IRS released interim guidance on how businesses should follow amortization of specified research and experimental expenditures for the Sec. 174 R&amp;D tax deduction. The main takeaway is that the companies should use this interim guidance until full guidance is released for the 2024 tax year.

    "content": "The U.S. has long been a leader in early-stage basic research and in recent years made efforts to support the commercialization of these ideas. New clean energy technologies are needed at scale to meet U.S. decarbonization goals and supporting innovative clean energy entrepreneurs and startups is a key part of this equation. Supporting the transition of U.S. basic research to commercial product also contributes to energy security and global competitiveness by keeping these groundbreaking ideas – and the minds behind them – in the U.S. There are many ways to characterize the maturity of a technology as it transitions from lab to market. Private investors may consider a company&#8217;s funding stage (seed, Series A, etc.) while the federal government has traditionally relied on technology readiness levels (a scale from 1 to 9) to describe growth. Technology stage (R&amp;D, demonstration, etc.) is another framing that is often used, but it is difficult to apply this framing universally without more specific benchmarks to differentiate between stages. Given that startups often rely on a combination of private capital and government funding to get to market, it is useful to have a shared language for technology maturity to translate between public and private sector funding opportunities. Using common terminology can help address critical funding gaps across the entire investment landscape that may otherwise prevent promising technology solutions from reaching a meaningful scale. In this blog, we summarize a few key frameworks that have been used to describe technology maturity and propose a new way to discuss technology maturity based on risk. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) The technology readiness levels (TRL) were developed by NASA amid the Space Race in the 1970s to assess technological maturity for use in complex systems – like the Apollo 11 mission that put a man on the moon. TRL tracks a product&#8217;s development from basic scientific discovery, through demonstration in various settings, and ending when the technology is validated at full scale in an operational environment. This approach is the most common terminology used by the federal government to describe technology maturity but its focus on technology rather than market adoption means it is not always the best fit for private sector funders to assess the maturity of a technology. NASA’s technology readiness levels Technology Stages Another common method for addressing the commercialization process is through technology stages, generally R&amp;D, development, demonstration, and deployment. These are seemingly ubiquitous but are far from standardized—the definition of each stage can vary across technology areas, sectors, and even between companies and their funders. A number of organizations have acknowledged this issue and proposed definitions for technology stages. In their 2022 report, Prime Coalition highlighted that the lack of standards from “pilot” to “proven technology” often leads to confusion for funders and lack of clarity around measures needed for successful outcomes. “Proven” for a venture capital investor’s perspective is not necessarily the same as “proven” from a project capital provider’s perspective, as each entity is set up to take on different levels of&hellip;",

The Governor of California appoints a Democratic Party operative living in the Washington, DC-area to fill the vacancy. Questions of residency and qualifications could potentially dash the appointment. Across Pennsylvania Ave., the first-term president, a longtime former senator himself, is preparing for reelection. 2023? Yes, but also 1964. The recent death of Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) prompted Governor Gavin Newsom to announce his appointment of Laphonza Butler as her successor. News reports indicate that Butler now lives in Maryland  but was previously a longtime California resident and intends to re-establish residency imminently. Butler, until the appointment, ran a well-known political fundraising outfit with ties to the Democratic Party. Eerily similar circumstances surrounded the 1964 death of Senator Clair Engle (D-CA) and Governor Pat Brown’s (D-CA) appointment of Pierre Salinger to fill the vacancy. Salinger served as White House Press Secretary for Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and  John F. Kennedy until months before the appointment, and was living in Virginia. Like Butler, he was previously a California resident. The Senate’s process, debates, and decisions in 1964 might be instructive today if the Butler appointment is challenged. Process When Salinger’s certificate of appointment came before the Senate on August 5, 1964, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT) already knew there would be trouble, or as he referred to it “a little discussion.” Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL) moved that the Senate refer the matter to the Committee on Rules and Administration before Salinger be sworn in. Dirksen, however, anticipated correctly that Mansfield would make a substitute motion, stating: “Obviously and properly the majority leader will offer a substitute motion for the motion that I have presented. While I have not seen the substitute, I would have to presume from past experience that the majority leader would ask that the appointee be allowed to take the oath and to take his seat in the Senate without prejudice, then sending the question to the Committee on Rules and Administration.” Mansfield ultimately made such a substitute motion and the Senate agreed to have the Rules Committee report back on August 13. Salinger was then administered the oath by the president pro tempore. Debate over the motion clarified that “without prejudice” meant that administration of the oath did not nullify future action by the Senate, any individual, or any other institution—such as the courts. The Rules Committee’s Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections held hearings and took testimony on August 10 and met in executive session on August 11 to consider the matter. On August 12, the Rules Committee reported a resolution to the Senate resolving, “That Pierre Salinger is entitled to a seat in the United States Senate as a Senator from the State of California.” The committee reported the resolution favorably and adopted its accompanying report by a 7-1 vote, and the Senate agreed to it on August 13 – but only after extensive debate. The lessons from the Salinger case reinforce and&hellip;",

    "content": "Industrial policy refers to an organized set of government policies intended to achieve specific economic goals, from reducing unemployment to boosting production within a certain sector. There is strong bipartisan interest in expanding U.S. industrial policy, which could have a major impact on U.S. competitiveness in the years to come—especially as other countries pledge significant government support for nascent industries and technologies. The following highlights recent U.S. industrial policy efforts, as well as the opportunities and challenges ahead for lawmakers. Why Policymakers Are Interested in Industrial Policy U.S. policymakers are working across the aisle with a renewed interest in industrial policy for several reasons, among them: Supply Chain Independence: The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already existing supply chain issues, leaving key industries vulnerable to interruptions in economic activity and shortages. Policymakers want to spur U.S. supply chain independence and market competitiveness to protect against future crises. National Security: With the rise of China and its plan to lead the world in emerging technologies, some policymakers see it as imperative for the U.S. to intervene in markets to improve national security outcomes. These driving factors have led to numerous legislative proposals over the past several years, some of which have made it all the way to the president’s desk for his signature. Recent U.S. Industrial Policy Efforts The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS), signed into law in August 2022, is a prominent recent example of the bipartisan effort underway to expand U.S. industrial policy. The legislation provided nearly $80 billion for American semiconductor production through grants and tax incentives for domestic manufacturing. Democrats in Congress also prioritized industrial policy in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), providing “bonus” energy tax credits for firms that meet domestic content and labor policy goals. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is leading a working group on artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure the U.S. is a leader in AI innovation. And an increasing number of policymakers and stakeholders, including some on the political right, have expressed an interest in increasing America’s involvement and investments in other areas of industrial policy. Opportunities in Industrial Policy There are several goals policymakers seek to accomplish under the industrial policy umbrella and many ways to measure success. These include, but are not limited to: GDP growth; supply chain resilience; technological innovation; development of high-quality products and services; creation of high-paying American jobs, and; furtherance of U.S. foreign policy goals. If U.S. industrial policy is to be successful, policymakers must establish goals that are: targeted; implementable; realistic; consistent, and; measurable. With so many goals included in expansive laws like CHIPS and the IRA—from creating U.S. jobs and countering China to strengthening national security and mitigating climate change—the impact and metrics of the individual policies can easily become murky or, even worse, contradict one another. Drawbacks of Industrial Policy While industrial policy offers opportunities for the U.S. to invest in 21st century innovations and growth, there are many potholes to avoid.

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background Over the last few decades, Minneapolis failed to build enough housing to support population growth, resulting in unaffordable housing prices. From 2010-2016 the city added more than 37,000 residents, but only 12,000 new housing units. Minneapolis also saw a decline of about 15,000 affordable units (available for households earning 50% of the area median income) since 2010, as prices increased for many previously affordable units. Meanwhile, the median home price rose from around $200,000 in 2014 to over $320,000 in 2021. Exclusionary zoning policies have also contributed to racial segregation in Minneapolis. A working paper by the Mercatus Center found evidence of a strong relationship between single-family zoning and racial segregation in both Minneapolis and St. Paul, with single-family zoned neighborhoods housing 21% fewer non-white residents than neighborhoods that allow apartments, controlling for price differences. Reforms Implemented  In 2015, the Minneapolis City Council passed a law that eliminated parking requirements for buildings with three to 50 units near high-frequency public transit (with service every 15 minutes or less) and allowed for a 50% reduction in these requirements for larger residential buildings. Then in 2019, the Minneapolis City Council approved its 2040 Comprehensive Plan, effective at the start of 2020. By approving the plan, Minneapolis became the first large city to eliminate single-family zoning citywide. The plan also included provisions to: Expand zones that are eligible for housing Allow the highest-level density housing in and near downtown Allow multifamily housing and density on public transit routes Eliminate minimum off-street parking requirements on new developments citywide However, in June 2022, a county judge ordered an injunction against the 2040 plan, ruling that the city must halt implementation and revise the plan to follow the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act in response to a lawsuit by Smart Growth Minneapolis and the Audubon Chapter of Minneapolis. Minneapolis appealed the decision and has been allowed to implement the 2040 plan during the appeals process—though, as of April 2023, zoning codes were still being updated to align with the plan. Early Evidence 2015 Changes to Parking Requirements While it is possible that other factors played a role, Minneapolis did see an increase in multifamily housing after 2015 compared to previous years, indicating that eliminating parking minimums could have helped encourage housing development. Specifically, the ratio of parking spaces to housing units fell significantly, and there are several prominent examples of new, large housing projects with much less parking than previously required—further evidence that reduced parking requirements could have played a pivotal role in allowing for more housing. 2040 Plan As it has been only three years since the 2040 plan went into effect, it may take several years for the market to respond and to measure the plan’s impact. New housing has not yet seen a significant uptick compared to years prior to 2020—though compared to other midwestern cities, Minneapolis multifamily housing construction in the first six months of 2022 was particularly robust. Rolling back single-family zoning was intended to spur the&hellip;",

    "content": "Restrictive zoning and land use practices are one of the major barriers to increasing our nation’s housing supply in high-demand regions, thereby contributing to unaffordable housing costs. In recent years, however, proponents of zoning reform have organized, worked to build public support, and secured high-profile policy achievements to allow for more and different types of housing to be built. In some instances, they have succeeded in rolling back burdensome regulatory requirements, which typically prevent development. The J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy has developed a series of brief case studies highlighting several zoning and land use reforms enacted at the local and state levels. The case studies include details of specific provisions to allow for more housing and greater density, as well as a snapshot of any early evidence of impacts. However, because most state and local actions to advance zoning reform have been quite recent, it is premature to evaluate the overall effectiveness of these policy changes. The full consequences of the changes should become more evident in the coming years. Case study series illustrated by Wynton Henderson Case Studies Key Lessons Learned Zoning reform is only one part of the equation. Zoning and land use reform is an essential prerequisite for increasing development, since building more housing is subject to significant legal restrictions in many communities. However, simply improving zoning and land use practices for new construction is often insufficient. Affordable housing is expensive to build, and policies that encourage the construction and financing of new developments to take advantage of new housing capacity may also be necessary. In several cases, reforms may only result in a modest increase in housing supply and affordability. A recent study from the Urban Institute found that, nationwide, policies to relax land use restrictions increased housing supply by an average of 0.8% in the medium term (3 to 9 years).1 This mild but statistically significant effect likely reflects the fact that most land use reforms so far have implemented minor tweaks to the existing rules, while bold, sweeping reforms are a new phenomenon. For the most part, there have not been ambitious land use changes in the U.S., and the few that have passed have yet to take full effect. Still, a modest impact from a land use reform measure does not mean that the measure is unimportant; rather, it likely indicates that the reform is the first step of a process. Successful reform requires multiple attempts and sustained community engagement. Since 2016, the California State Legislature has passed over a dozen bills to encourage accessory dwelling unit (ADU) development. By closing specific loopholes and removing restrictions imposed by local entities, the passage of these bills was necessary for local ADU development to occur.  The fact that so many different pieces of legislation passed demonstrates that zoning and land use reform often requires an iterative process rather than a “one-off&#8221; action—reformers need to build durable support and keep reform at the top of the agenda to make continued progress to encourage&hellip;",

More than a dozen experts shared ideas on carbon market integrity, innovations in livestock-specific carbon credits, and how federal policies can support and further improve economic incentives for on-farm sustainability efforts. The first panel emphasized that best-available science must be used to ensure that credits represent meaningful, verifiable reductions in methane emissions against a robustly measured baseline. Strong methods for conducting verification are also essential to build trust in agricultural carbon credit projects. The panel explored what the dairy and livestock industries can learn from state-level activities, including from California’s mandate to reduce methane emissions. The second panel focused on creating profitability on farms while incorporating sustainable practices through a livestock carbon market. Companies seeking to reduce carbon emissions within their own supply chains can use a “carbon insetting” approach, for example by supporting farmers who want to implement dairy digesters or feed additives for livestock and reduce enteric methane emissions. Panelists discussed the launch of the world’s first carbon insetting marketplace for animal agriculture that is focused on validating, certifying, aggregating, and ultimately monetizing the carbon value of on-farm practice changes. The third panel spoke to the role the federal government can play in supporting sustainability on farms, highlighting key USDA conservation and research programs that focus on issues like soil health, methane capture, and nutrient management. These practices create value for the producer as well as the climate. Panelists also called for faster government action to approve new products, like livestock feed additives, and for programs to support producers of all sizes who want to implement sustainable and climate-smart practices.

With Congress aiming to bolster national competitiveness, high skilled immigration can help improve U.S. security and strengthen the economy by driving technological and industrial innovation. To expand on this topic further, BPC hosted an online event in April on high skilled immigration and its vital importance for national security and competitiveness. Ben Gitis, associate director of the Economic Policy Program, presented BPC poll results on Americans’ perceptions of high skilled immigration, which was followed by a panel discussion on the role of high skilled immigration in advancing U.S. competitiveness. The panelists included: Kai Hirabayashi, senior manager of public policy at Amazon; Divyansh Kaushik, associate director of the Federation of American Scientists; Margaret Stock, attorney at Cascadia Cross-Border Law Group; and Dane Stangler, director of strategic initiatives at BPC. Below are some takeaways from the discussion. Immigration is vital for national security, especially considering recent military recruitment shortages. While immigration isn&#8217;t typically linked to enhanced national security, Divyansh Kaushik set the tone for the discussion with a quote from Winston Churchill’s wartime military secretary: &#8220;The Allies won the war because our German scientists were better than their German scientists.” Skilled talent from across the globe has driven advancements in U.S. national security for decades. However, with green card backlogs making legal immigration to the U.S. more difficult in recent years, America’s weakened visa system is turning skilled talent away from the nation. Margaret Stock focused on the needs of our military and shared that the armed forces have been facing recruitment challenges. While immigrants used to make up a significant proportion of the U.S. military, their participation in the armed forces is at historic lows. This is not because immigrants no longer want to serve, but because immigrants need a green card to enlist, and it is very difficult to obtain one. Skilled immigration drives entrepreneurship and job creation. The impact of the visa backlogs also extends to the nation’s economic strength and standing. Dane Stangler added that immigrants help bolster national competitiveness by playing a key role in expanding and diversifying the economy. He stated that immigrants create businesses and generate entrepreneurial activity at higher rates than native-born Americans. This trend is especially prevalent in the science and technology fields which are critical for innovation. Stangler also shared that immigrant business owners across all types and sizes of businesses create jobs at a higher rate than native workers, opening up more opportunities for workers in the U.S. Barriers to extending visas and obtaining green cards restrict the contributions immigrants make to both entrepreneurship and business. Kai Hirabayashi shared his specific experience working with Amazon, a company that has many foreign-born employees who start with the company on temporary visas and are later sponsored for green cards. Hirabayashi stated that many of Amazon’s employees’ lives are often disrupted when their temporary visas&hellip;",

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background Nebraska has a shortage of affordable homes for low-income households, with only 77 units affordable and available for every 100 renters with incomes at 50% of the area median. Two- to 4-unit housing has seen a steady decline in the state: in the 2010s, Nebraska permitted more than 2,000 units in 2- to 4-unit buildings, compared to over 6,000 in the 1970s. Reforms Implemented In response to Nebraska’s housing affordability challenges, State Senator Matt Hansen developed statewide legislation to allow more housing to be built, gaining support from local realtors and AARP Nebraska. Sen. Hansen said he did not have &#8220;very much negative feedback.&#8221; In 2020, the Nebraska State Legislature passed LB866, which included the Municipal Density and Missing Middle Housing Act, a version of Sen. Hansen’s bill, by a vote of 31-7. LB866 is a less prescriptive policy tool than other reforms in this series of case studies. Rather than setting specific zoning or land use requirements or preempting local laws, the bill requires cities to provide detailed information about their housing needs and existing land use practices. The bill also requires cities to develop their own action plans to increase affordable, denser housing, through zoning reforms and other actions. 253 While not as prescriptive as statewide zoning reform laws in California and Oregon, Nebraska’s approach through LB866 may build more buy-in from cities by encouraging them to be proactive about developing comprehensive, impactful plans to meet their specific needs. Additionally, the law’s information reporting requirements will help the state understand its needs in extensive detail. Finally, the law pairs its zoning reforms with new grants for middle-income housing development—a strategic approach, as zoning reform alone is not sufficient to meet housing supply gaps. Early Evidence The deadline for larger cities to adopt new action plans was in January 2023, and the deadline for smaller cities is January 2024, so it is still far too early to measure the impact of LB866 in terms of the development of new housing. But early city action plans provide an indication of how seriously cities are taking the state’s mandate to carry out zoning reform. Omaha’s action plan declares the city should revise its Zoning Ordinance to “make it easier to build a variety of building types while still respecting existing neighborhood character.” It proposes—though does not commit to—modifying the Zoning Ordinance to allow for more triplexes, fourplexes, and smaller-scale multifamily housing. It also proposes allowing for more ADUs and modifying minimum parking requirements. Lincoln’s more detailed action plan proposes reducing or eliminating parking requirements for affordable units within half a mile of bus lines, as well as allowing more residential housing in commercial areas. The plan also proposes allowing a by-right development process for housing types that have been allowed as exceptions to existing ordinances in the past. These proposals outline modest but meaningful measures to allow for more affordable housing options. The degree to which cities like Omaha and Lincoln take action to implement these&hellip;",

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background From 2010 to 2020, Oregon’s population increased by more than 400,000 people, but its housing supply only increased by about 150,000 units. Meanwhile, over the past decade, housing prices have doubled in the state. Oregon has seen a sharp decrease in the production of duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes: in the 1970s, Oregon provided more than 40,000 permits for 2- to 4-unit housing, but in the 2010s it provided only about 4,000 such permits. Reforms Implemented  Beginning in 2019, Oregon passed a series of zoning and land use reforms outlined in the table below. Year Reform details 2019 Ban on single-family zoning: Oregon’s state legislature passed the bipartisan House Bill 2001, the first statewide bill to prohibit single-family zoning for localities. Specifically: ·       Towns and cities with over 10,000 residents were required to allow duplexes on land zoned for single-family homes by June 2021. ·       Towns and cities with over 25,000 residents were required to allow up to four-unit buildings as well as cottage clusters—four or more detached units with a shared courtyard—in residential zones by June 2022. 2020 Model housing code: The Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) established a model housing code for mid-size cities to adopt to allow for missing middle housing. 2021 Lot divisions: The legislature passed Senate Bill 458, requiring any jurisdiction subject to the HB 2001 changes to allow lot divisions—meaning that homeowners and developers in Oregon can convert existing single-family housing into duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes where those types of residences are legal. 2022 Ban on parking minimums: The state’s land use commission unanimously voted to roll back minimum parking requirements. Beginning January 1, 2023, 61 cities and 8 metro regions are required to eliminate parking requirements near high-frequency transit service, with more comprehensive reforms required in coming years. Early Evidence Most large cities did not update their zoning codes to meet House Bill 2001 requirements until 2021 or 2022, so Oregon’s new law is only just beginning to take effect this year and it is far too soon to measure its impact. In 2020, housing in 2- to 4-unit buildings made up less than 3% of Oregon’s new housing permits—so the state has a long way to go to make “missing middle” housing a substantial part of its housing stock. The legislation does not prevent cities from finding other ways to block denser housing, such as lot size and setback requirements. Additionally, slow permitting for new housing is a major barrier for developers to build new housing in Oregon. In the first six months after the new zoning rules took effect in Portland, the city saw 127 permits for units that were newly legal. Local policymakers in Portland seem to anticipate the new statewide laws will not be enough to catalyze the development of missing middle housing. In 2022 Portland’s City Council unanimously approved a slate of technical zoning changes designed to ensure that 2- to 4-unit buildings are feasible across the city. Unlike Minneapolis, which eliminated single-family&hellip;",

    "content": "In August 2023, the Department of Education rolled out a new income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. This program, the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, aims to tackle major issues within the IDR system and provide student loan borrowers with a more generous repayment option. Yet the SAVE Plan is expensive and poorly targeted, underscoring the need for bipartisan, durable solutions to help struggling borrowers and comprehensively reform a broken IDR system. Serving as an alternative to standard student loan repayment options, IDR plans provide relief to heavily indebted borrowers by guaranteeing manageable payments. These plans tie loan payments to the borrower’s income—10% of discretionary income, in the case of the most used existing plan, the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) Plan—and provide forgiveness of remaining balances after 20 or 25 years of repayment. The IDR system has long been excessively complex for borrowers to navigate. Prior to the enactment of the SAVE Plan, there were four different IDR plans with varying terms, making it difficult for borrowers to determine which plan was best for them. Borrowers had to opt into an IDR plan and recertify their participation annually, which could discourage take-up—especially for the most vulnerable. Borrowers on an IDR plan could also see their loan balance increase over time if their monthly payments did not cover accrued interest since unpaid interest was capitalized and added to their principal balance. In addition, IDR plans have been plagued with servicing errors. On August 14, the Department of Education discharged nearly $40 billion in student loan debt for 800,000 borrowers on IDR plans who had made 20 or 25 years&#8217; worth of loan payments but had not received the forgiveness to which they were entitled. Both the Biden administration and legislators have proposed changes to address these longstanding issues within the IDR system. The administration’s SAVE Plan replaced the REPAYE Plan, raising the income threshold under which borrowers are not required to make payment from 150% to 225% of the federal poverty line, reducing monthly payments from 10% of discretionary income to 5%, offering forgiveness for eligible borrowers with low initial balances after just 10 years, providing for automatic enrollment of borrowers who are delinquent in their payments, and eliminating interest capitalization. Although BPC commends the goal of simplifying and streamlining the IDR system, this plan is costly and regressive. By reducing payments for borrowers regardless of their ability to pay, a significant portion of the plan’s benefits are likely to go to higher-income households. Some argue that the SAVE Plan is an indirect approach to student loan forgiveness, following the Supreme Court&#8217;s rejection debt cancellation. Because IDR reform has significant federal budget implications, it should be determined by Congress. Recent legislative proposals provide three different paths: The SAVE for Students Act (S. 1971), sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), would streamline repayment options for borrowers by creating a single IDR plan based on the REPAYE Plan. Borrowers who are delinquent on their payments would be automatically enrolled and&hellip;",

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background Houston is the only major American city without zoning, meaning it does not comprehensively separate communities by use type, nor does it directly regulate density. However, the city does have land use regulations that shape neighborhoods, including minimum parking requirements and lot sizes. Minimum lot sizes set a minimum square width below which properties cannot be subdivided. In the 1990s, Houston’s population rose steeply, necessitating an increase in the supply of affordable homes. Reforms Implemented In 1998, Houston made substantial revisions to its Development Ordinance as the result of a comprehensive review of planning practices by a citizen committee as well as Houston’s Planning Commission. The reforms were designed to allow for denser, more walkable neighborhoods. Specifically, the city lowered the minimum lot size for single-family homes from 5,000 square feet to as low as 1,400 square feet subject to certain technical conditions in the city center (and 3,500 square feet within most of its broader urban area). Functionally, this change made it possible to divide a large single property into three units. The new ordinance also made the process for granting approval for such redevelopments more efficient. In 2013, Houston expanded the lower minimum lot sizes beyond the city’s most urban area to apply citywide. Notably, communities were allowed to opt out of new requirements to allow for smaller lots. Researchers have posited that the opt-out flexibility was crucial for allowing the new requirements to pass, as it quelled local opposition to the measure. Early Evidence Over 25,000 homes were developed on lots under 5,000 square feet between 1999 and 2016—clear evidence that the 1998 reform directly allowed for denser housing. New, smaller lots were particularly prominent in underutilized commercial land and middle-income residential communities, likely because wealthier communities opted out of the reduced lot size requirements while lower-income communities lacked sufficient demand for any new housing that might be built. Recent research by NYU’s Furman Center found that, from 2005 to 2020, Houston saw more than 5,300 conversions of detached single-family houses to townhouses—where houses on larger lots were replaced with multiple taller, thinner homes. The Furman Center study estimated that less than one-fifth of new dense housing was a result of conversions, with most dense housing constructed on commercial and industrial land. Single-family to townhouse conversions were concentrated in the urban core where smaller and older houses had existed and produced relatively affordable homes. The median townhouse on a formerly single-family lot in 2020 was valued at $340,000, compared to $545,000 for single-family houses built 2007 or later on unsubdivided parcels. As the graph below shows, 2- to 4-unit housing supply increased in the years following the 1998 and 2013 reforms, though a variety of factors undoubtedly played a role in these trends. This data also omits single-family townhomes, which were a large component of the rise in denser housing. Houston has a median house price below the national median despite decades of job and population growth. Read more zoning and land&hellip;",

    "content": "Amid the current debate in Washington, DC, around U.S. competitiveness issues, BPC has been crossing the nation gathering local perspectives through roundtable discussions with private and public sector leaders. Our most recent stop was Corvallis, OR, where we engaged in a conversation about innovation within the state’s food and beverage industry. &nbsp; “We do a lot of stuff well in Oregon. What we do best is grow things and we need to keep doing that and adding value and shipping around the world.” —Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) The idea of “innovation” typically invokes notions of software, laboratories, and, especially in today’s federal policy debates, semiconductor manufacturing. Indeed, it can often seem as if policymakers are locked into one idea of what innovation is. We know, of course, that innovation takes various forms. Within industries, it can occur at every level of the supply chain, from the most basic inputs to the highest value-added outputs. It happens within companies as they adapt their organizational structures to enhance efficiency. And it happens all over the country, even if phenomena such as venture capital investing—closely associated with innovation—are heavily clustered geographically. When thinking of innovation, the food and beverage industry is possibly one of the least often thought of, even though there’s nothing more fundamental to our lives than food. Go ahead: Make a mental list of what industries you associate with “innovation.” Is food and beverage in the top five? Does it even make your top 10? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t, but a prevailing sentiment during our roundtable discussion in Corvallis, OR, in August was that innovation within the food and beverage industry often goes unnoticed. Hosted by Oregon State University, and led by the Oregon Business Council, the roundtable brought together companies, elected officials, higher education representatives, and others to discuss the state and future of Oregon’s food and beverage economy and innovation’s role in it. Sen. Wyden, the state’s senior senator and chair of the Senate Finance Committee, joined the discussion. His comment above underscores the significance of discussing innovation within the food and beverage sector. Food and drink fall under tradable goods, which are essential for economic growth and job creation. Which is why innovation in this industry is critical, as one participant mentioned, “At the heart of a great food and beverage system is research and development (R&amp;D).” From Chips to Grapes (and Cheese and Coffee …) Oregon turned out to be perhaps the perfect place to have this kind of discussion. The state has a rich history of semiconductor manufacturing: Intel has had a presence in the state for 50 years and employs thousands of residents. The company recently announced plans to expand one of its sites—an effort that will receive support from the state, which set aside $260 million earlier this year to leverage federal CHIPS and Science Act funding for semiconductors. In July, Analog Devices also announced a $1 billion expansion of its Oregon semiconductor facility. Yet the state also boasts a thriving agricultural industry with&hellip;",

Auburn, ME—a town of 24,000 located 35 miles from Portland—has plenty of job opportunities but has failed to grow its population over the last few decades due to restrictive zoning, according to Republican Mayor Jason Levesque. Elected in 2017, Mayor Levesque set out to reform the town’s zoning laws, land use practices, and permitting processes to encourage development. He set a goal of adding 2,000 units to the housing stock and attracting 6,000 new residents—a 25% population increase—by 2025. The Agriculture and Resource Protection Zone (known as the Ag Zone) accounts for about 40% of the land in Auburn. Initially set aside for farming but today mostly forested, it heavily restricts development within its borders. Most homeowners in the Ag Zone also oppose nearby development due to concerns it would raise their property taxes. Mayor Levesque’s first attempt at reforms to the Ag Zone failed due to strong opposition. After this setback, the city engaged a variety of stakeholder groups to solicit input, listened to residents’ concerns, and then refined its approach. Reforms Implemented Because mayors do not possess much formal authority in Auburn, Mayor Levesque had to rely on the cooperation of the City Council and Planning Board. Between 2019 and 2023, the City Council passed several reforms including the following: Additionally, Auburn started to sell publicly owned land for housing development. As of October 2022, the city had seven parcels of publicly owned land for sale in an attempt to generate revenue for the city while encouraging developers to increase housing supply. The city also reduced permitting fees out of concern they provided an obstacle to development. Early Evidence While the changes in law are too recent to determine their long-term effect, Auburn had more than 400 units in development in October 2022, the majority of which are multifamily units. The city saw a spike in permit approvals in 2022, with 237 housing units permitted, up from only 26 in 2021. Builders are also using unique and underused buildings, including a former church, for housing developments. In 2023, a local developer applied for a permit to build a mixed-use apartment complex with about 1,100 units across 80 acres, which would be more than 10 times the typical number of houses permitted in Auburn in recent years, and equivalent to about 5% of the city’s population.

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background Cities across the nation have minimum parking requirements, which set a mandatory number of parking spaces to be included when new housing is developed. These minimums have led to an oversupply of parking, with parking spaces making more than one-third of land in many American city centers. Parking minimums raise the cost of housing by using up valuable land, thereby preventing increases in housing density and supply. They also add to construction costs: As of 2016, the average cost to build a parking space was found to range from $5,000 per surface space to up to $35,000 per underground garage space. The extra costs of construction are passed on to households or businesses in the form of higher rents or sale prices, and they disincentivize development. In Buffalo, NY, parking spaces made up much of the downtown area by 2017, guided by a zoning code established in 1953. Meanwhile, over that same period, the city experienced a significant decline in population, jobs, and economic investment, as well as a dwindling housing supply—lessening the need for so much parking downtown. Reforms Implemented In 2017, Buffalo enacted its Unified Development Ordinance, or Green Code, becoming the first U.S. city to eliminate off-street parking minimums citywide. Under the new ordinance, large development proposals are required to submit transportation demand management plans, although these still have no standard parking minimums. The elimination of parking minimums allows developers to consider a variety of factors including the walkability of an area, the distance from bus or light rail stops, and the possibility of shared parking arrangements. While other case studies in this series highlight reforms to boost housing supply to keep pace with the demand for homes, Buffalo did not have excess housing demand it needed to satisfy. Instead, Buffalo’s Green Code was proposed as a tool to attract businesses and offices, promote economic development, and revitalize the downtown, as well as to reduce the city’s environmental impact. However, for other cities, eliminating parking minimums is in fact a tool to increase affordable housing supply to meet demand. Early Evidence In the years after the city eliminated its parking minimums, the reform meaningfully reduced the number of new annual parking spaces per unit of development. Specifically, new mixed-use developments—those with both residential and commercial units—included less than half of the parking spaces that would have been required under previous parking minimums. However, development for single-use residential, commercial, and civic developments exceeded the previous parking minimums. Overall, in the first two years of the reform, the number of off-street parking spaces decreased by 502 spaces. This immediate, overall drop in the number of new parking spaces demonstrates that Buffalo’s elimination of parking requirements is having the impact the city intended. Out of the developments that chose to include parking, one-third made parking an amenity available at an extra charge, instead of factoring the cost of the spot into rent or the purchase price. As a result, there are signs the city is&hellip;",

    "content": "1. What is human capital data and why is it important? Human capital is the value of a company&#8217;s workforce including its skills, education, training, retention, and other factors that distinguish it in the sector. Human capital data, if material, has become an increasingly important asset to certain companies in certain sectors. This data’s importance has grown as a result of changes in the overall economy where the skills of the workforce are seen as increasingly important. 2. Prior to 2020, what type of human capital data has been disclosed? Historically, under Regulation S-K of the U.S. Securities Act of 1934 where human capital data is disclosed, a company would only have to disclose the number of people it employs. However, if a company has more than 100 employees then it would have to disclose demographic data including race, ethnicity, sex, and job categories to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission per the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 3. What do the revisions to Regulation S-K, enacted in 2020, require? It requires companies to expand and clarify their human capital data to the extent that it is material to an investor’s understanding of the company. The rule provides a non-exhaustive list of disclosures topics including a description of a company&#8217;s human capital resources. It further requires a description of any measures or objectives that a company’s management focuses on in managing its business including how it &#8220;attracts, develops, and retains personnel.&#8221; The rule also requires that companies disclose all material regulations that affect the business. This includes the disclosure of material environmental issues. 4. Who decides what&#8217;s &#8220;material&#8221; for a company to disclose? The company ultimately decides what&#8217;s material to a reasonable investor based on the total mix of relevant data. The SEC has made clear that a company&#8217;s human capital disclosure must be tailored to facts and circumstances of its unique business and workforce. 5. What is expected in the upcoming rule? In June of 2021, current SEC Chair Gary Gensler asked his staff for recommendations on how to move from a principles-based disclosure framework to a more prescriptive version. He argued that a principles-based disclosure will not provide human capital data that is consistent, reliable, and comparable across sectors. Human capital data has become exceedingly important for companies. As a result, the SEC is likely to mandate disclosure regardless of a company&#8217;s own materiality analysis.  6. What are the likely arguments against the proposed changes? The 2020 rule was a compromise based on an analysis of public comments. The 2020 rule has only been in effect for two years, and importantly, human capital disclosure has increased in S&amp;P 100 companies. A one-size-fits-all prescriptive disclosure framework was never the intent of Regulation S-K. The SEC is deciding what is material without congressional authority. Reasonable investors want material information, not an exhaustive list of nonrelevant data just to compare across sectors, especially if disclosing such data adds unnecessary costs to the disclosure process.",

The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. You can read the other blogs in our series on congressional support for reauthorization here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. Remarkably, the House and Senate Small Business Committees have reported two dozen bills this year with near unanimous bipartisan support. Addressing the three “C’s” of the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) mission—capital, contracting, and counseling—as well as other aspects of the agency, the bills present elements of what could be a significant modernization of SBA. With Congress resuming legislative activity this month, and another markup already scheduled for September 14 in the House Small Business Committee, we address several key questions about SBA reauthorization in this final blog of the “Road to Reauthorization” series. What’s Been Agreed to? Members of both committees have found bipartisan agreement on nearly all of the bills that have been considered in the three markups held this year. Among other things, these bills make notable reforms to SBA’s flagship lending program, expand the kinds of services available to small businesses through SBA resource partners, and boost U.S. competitiveness by strengthening the commercialization of innovative technologies developed by small firms.

    "content": "In this year’s State of the Union Address, President Biden called for bipartisan legislation “to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on personal data these companies collect on all of us.” Both Republicans and Democrats have also underscored the urgency of strengthening protections for children and teenagers online, citing concerns about privacy, exposure to certain types of content, and the detrimental impact of too much time online. Despite the broad consensus that protecting youth online is critical, the 118th Congress has yet to pass federal data privacy legislation–neither a comprehensive bill that protects children, teens, and adults, nor a narrower bill that specifically protects minors. Why? One of the key issues delaying legislation is an ongoing debate about age-based data privacy and online content moderation requirements and the controversial “age assurance” technologies that online platforms may use to comply with those requirements. Opinions diverge on whether age assurance requirements–and the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies deployed to satisfy them–are more beneficial than harmful. Several advocacy groups emphasize that youth require special protection and that prioritizing youth-focused legislation is necessary. Others stress that passing data privacy, AI governance, and online content moderation legislation that protects internet users of all ages would be better. There is bipartisan cooperation on both sides of this debate. This blog explains age assurance technologies and contextualizes their benefits and risks in ongoing legislative discussions. By analyzing this issue at the center of the “technology policy trifecta,” this piece aims to help policymakers evaluate the pros and cons of advancing data privacy and online safety legislation with and without age-based requirements and restrictions. Which Technologies Can Enable Age Assurance? Age assurance technologies can enable online platforms to limit access to users above a given age and create user account settings that differ based on age. For example, some social media platforms have age assurance requirements that users must satisfy before creating accounts. Other social media platforms have age assurance requirements that users must satisfy before accessing certain features or services. How do these platforms conduct age assurance? Approaches vary. Many “age assurance” approaches exist, and each approach may use different technologies and information. Age Assurance Risks and Rewards Policymakers, civil society organizations, academic researchers, and other stakeholders recognize that young people may be especially vulnerable to harm from particular online experiences. Proponents of age assurance requirements convey that declaring, estimating, or verifying age can help limit young people’s exposure to harmful content and interactions. Opponents of age assurance requirements stress that these requirements can limit free expression benefits from online anonymity and curtail access to helpful information. Determining which content is age-appropriate is no easy task. Age is not the only characteristic relevant to predicting the impact that content may have on an individual; some children may be more mature than others, and even equally mature children may have different content sensitivities. Age assurance technologies can also create data privacy risks by requiring&hellip;",

BPC supports legislation like this that eliminates policies that disincentivize savings, particularly for low-income Americans receiving federal assistance. While clearly difficult for low-income families, policies nonetheless should encourage them to save and take financially responsible steps that could remove them from future public assistance. Unfortunately, current SSI beneficiaries are told that accumulating just $2,000 in total assets means their benefits are cut off entirely—and that the government may even ask them to pay back the assistance they received in previous months. The $2,000 asset test was established nearly 40 years ago. This is unfair. Bringing the asset test into the 21st century is long-overdue. Finally, as former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, I’d be remiss if I didn’t note that this bill is estimated to cost $11 billion over 10 years. While I am concerned about the level of the federal debt, SSI recipients, who are primarily blind and disabled, are not the cause of our federal debt. And I am sure policymakers can offset the potential costs of the legislation as it works its way through Congress. This is the kind of investment we should be making—one that helps the most vulnerable among us, is fair and creates the right incentives, while reducing administrative workload faced by the Social Security Administration, and it is bipartisan.",

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background California’s housing supply shortage is among the worst in the nation, with a deficit of nearly 1 million homes. Increasing the supply of affordable housing is an enormous challenge for the state, with construction costs for affordable units regularly exceeding $1 million. While California has enacted a slate of major zoning and land use reforms statewide in recent years, this case study focuses only on laws to permit accessory dwelling units (ADUs)—independent residences located on the same lot as a single-family house. Since 1982, statewide law has granted cities the ability to permit ADUs, while still allowing cities to limit where ADUs can be located and the standards by which they had to abide. For decades, cities largely obstructed their development due to concerns about parking, neighborhood change, and other characteristics associated with development. In 2016, a little over 1,000 ADUs were permitted across the state. However, ADUs were widely utilized as housing even before California took steps to legalize them: in 2014, there were 50,000 unpermitted ADUs in Los Angeles alone, by one estimate. Reforms Implemented In 2016, the state legislature passed a pair of statewide bills (A.B. 2299 and S.B. 1069) that required cities and counties to allow ADUs on most residential lots, preempting local zoning ordinances and permitting processes. While the legislation was a major achievement, cities continued to employ an array of strategies to limit ADU development, including fees, parking requirements, and HOA restrictions. To address local efforts to prevent ADU development, the state legislature passed a dozen bills over the next six years to make ADUs possible for homeowners, summarized below. This slate of reforms has prevented cities and towns from using zoning and other restrictions to block ADUs, facilitated a more efficient permitting process for ADUs, and given the state more power to enforce ADU-related laws. The number of provisions passed by the state legislature demonstrates the level of detail that lawmakers felt they needed to provide to compel local jurisdictions to permit ADUs. Statewide reforms have also complemented and encouraged local government policy reforms. For example, San Diego’s City Council voted to expand on state laws through a density bonus policy, allowing homeowners to add an extra ADU to their property beyond what is already allowed if they rent it at a reduced rate to low- or moderate-income residents. Early Evidence As soon as the first reforms from 2016 took effect, ADU development rapidly and steadily increased, growing from just over 1,000 ADUs permitted in 2016 to over 24,000 permitted in 2022, about 19% of new housing permits. In Los Angeles, ADUs have seen a substantial rise, from fewer than 100 permits in 2016 to over 7,000 in 2022, about 30% of newly permitted units in the city. In all, over 80,000 ADUs have been permitted since 2016, though some of these units likely already existed illegally. While this figure will not solve California’s housing shortage, it adds a number of affordable units at&hellip;",

    "content": "Updated February 27, 2024: In December 2023, the House Committee on Education &amp; the Workforce advanced with bipartisan support the Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act, sponsored by Reps. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Bobby Scott (D-VA), Elise Stefanik (R-NY), and Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA). This bill combines accountability elements from the Jobs to Compete and the Pell Acts. It would require programs to meet both the Pell Act’s value-added earnings test and the Jobs to Compete Act’s high school earnings threshold. It would also allow both online and for-profit programs to qualify for Pell Grants. The Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act shows that tying eligibility for short-term Pell to program-level outcome metrics represents a bipartisan pathway to expanding access to programs that provide value for students. Although the bill is a significant step forward, work remains.To pay for the expansion of Pell Grants to short-term programs, the legislation would require institutions subject to the endowment tax to reimburse the government for any non-repayment on federal student loans. Unfortunately, this approach may prevent institutions from enrolling low- and moderate-income students who need to take out loans for graduate and professional programs and thus restrict the ability of these students to access institutions that generally deliver strong outcomes. It would also put these institutions on the hook when their graduates choose to participate in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act resolves disagreement about what kinds of programs should qualify for short-term Pell Grants by linking eligibility to strong accountability metrics. It would make sense to approach the bill’s offset in the same spirit, ensuring that federal aid continues to support programs that perform well and instead targeting programs that produce especially poor outcomes for students and taxpayers, rather than a class of institutions.] Original Post For years, policymakers have wrestled with the question of expanding Pell Grants to include short-term workforce programs. Under current law, only students enrolled in programs that run at least 16 weeks (600 clock hours) are eligible. Workforce Pell proposals would expand Pell eligibility to workforce programs between eight and 15 weeks (between 150 and 600 hours) in length. Despite significant bipartisan interest in expanding Pell eligibility, two key questions have stalled legislation: First, how should policymakers ensure Pell expansion only funds programs that provide value for students? Second, should short-term programs at for-profit institutions and fully online programs be eligible? Recent legislative proposals thread the needle by requiring short-term programs to demonstrate their value to qualify for Pell Grants, which could expand Pell eligibility while protecting students and taxpayers. The Question of Workforce Pell Grants The past two decades have seen notable growth in shorter-term credentials—certificates below associate degrees. Proponents of expanding Pell eligibility argue that short-term credentials provide a path to quality jobs and higher earnings for individuals who want to move quickly into in-demand occupations or who could benefit from upskilling or retraining, while addressing skills mismatches between the existing workforce and job openings. Critics warn, however, that short-term Pell could subsidize low-value programs that&hellip;",

The poll also found that while two in three (67%) voters say it is very important for Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work together to pass bipartisan legislation on the economy, three in five (59%) voters are not confident that members of either party will cross the aisle to do so. Republicans (62%) are less confident than Democrats (50%) that this will happen. More than half of voters do not trust the federal government, with nearly a quarter reporting no trust at all in the federal government. The economy and AI are also top of mind for voters: Nearly nine in ten voters say they are concerned about inflation in the U.S., including 57% who are very concerned. This worry spans age groups, political party, and community type, reflecting how inflation is a top priority for all voters. In addition, voters are more likely to have a negative (46%) than positive (37%) opinion about the rise in usage of AI in products and services, and a majority (73%) are concerned it will lead to job loss.

    "content": "Illustration by Wynton Henderson Background Before Grand Rapids, MI started to pursue zoning reform in the early 2000s, its city plan was rife with inconsistent and complex land use practices that hampered development. To help inform its reform efforts in the years leading up to 2008, the city carried out an 18-month planning process including almost 250 community engagement meetings. During these meetings, residents and business owners generally expressed a desire to maintain the character of their neighborhoods while not substantially opposing greater density. Reforms Implemented While Minneapolis’ more recent zoning-reform plan has garnered far more national attention, Grand Rapids effectively eliminated single-family zoning nearly a decade before in 2008. The city approved a new zoning ordinance that split the city into “character districts,” allowing denser development than was permissible in the early 2000s so long as it was consistent with what had historically been allowed before more restrictive zoning practices were implemented over the course of the 20th century. All the character district types allowed duplexes or apartments either by-right or with special approval—and 97% of applications seeking special approval were approved. &nbsp; The city streamlined the permitting process by allowing more housing by-right, with faster approvals, and by allowing multifamily housing development by-right in mixed-use commercial zones. The new ordinance also reduced parking minimums for both single-family and multifamily housing. Reportedly, the new zoning ordinance received very little opposition and was embraced by the public—perhaps a credit to the city’s extensive community engagement effort. According to Suzanne Schulz, a former planning director for the city of Grand Rapids, efforts to maintain neighborhoods’ design elements quelled residents’ opposition to greater density. Residents came on board when they learned that the increased density would reflect what had been developed historically—so neighborhoods would not see any entirely new forms of development that appear out of place. As Schulz put it: “If we already have different housing types in a community, why would we want to prohibit it in the future?” Early Evidence Since the new zoning ordinance was implemented in 2008—when housing production began to plummet nationwide because of the financial crisis—it is difficult to measure the impact of the reform on housing production. In the years immediately following the measure, multifamily housing production was low in Grand Rapids as well as the rest of the state. However, over the last decade, multifamily housing supply in Grand Rapids has seen a robust increase, which may have been made possible by the 2008 zoning ordinance. Further research would be beneficial to help determine the direct effect of zoning reform on housing supply and affordability in Grand Rapids. &nbsp; According to Schulz, the streamlined approval process enticed some developers—including Low Income Housing Tax Credit developers—and investors to build housing in Grand Rapids because it is easier to build there than elsewhere. Increasing population has been a priority for the city of Grand Rapids, which set the goal of adding 12,000 downtown residents—an objective made more feasible by zoning that allows for denser development.&hellip;",

Unfortunately, the relationships and definitions of these disciplines remain unclear for many. To help alleviate this confusion, this explainer will explain the interrelation between these fields and give a broad overview of each discipline and its relevance to policymakers. Relationship Between AI, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning AI is the foundation from which the other subdisciplines originated. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI, neural networks are a subset of machine learning, and deep learning is a subset of neural networks. As such, machine learning is a type of AI, but not all AI is machine learning. Understanding this difference is important because it allows one to understand if a policy will impact a specific discipline, like ML, or if it will impact all the disciplines and industries that use them.

Key Takeaways Understanding the differences between machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning on a detailed level quickly becomes challenging due to the complexity of these technologies. However, understanding a few high-level takeaways can help policymakers craft more effective and nuanced legislative frameworks. Key takeaways include: AI is the broadest foundational category that the rest of these other technologies fit into, like a series of nesting dolls. Deep learning is a subset of neural networks, which are a subset of machine learning, which is a subset of AI. Machine learning is a process by which a program, in an automated fashion, learns which variables are most important in completing a task and creates an algorithm to reflect that importance. This learning can create novel solutions, or unintended behaviors/outputs. Neural networks are a form of machine learning in which the program creates a secondary level of variables referred to as a hidden layer. Some neural networks have a tradeoff between explainability and accuracy. Deep learning is a subset of neural networks with three or more hidden layers. Artificial Intelligence Understanding AI is tricky, in part, because there is no universally accepted definition. Recognizing this, many governments and multilateral organizations use similar language to describe AI. The OECD defines AI as: “&#8230;a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.” Citing the National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2020, the State Department defines AI as: “a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.” House Resolution 1250, which established the principles that should guide the national artificial intelligence&hellip;",

    "content": "Starting September 1, 2023, the roughly 43 million Americans with federal student debt will see interest accrue on their loans for the first time in more than three years, with payments expected to restart in October. The end of the pandemic-era forbearance policy could siphon more than $70 billion per year out of the economy. Although household finances will be somewhat buffered in the short term due to a lengthy grace period and generous repayment plans, the restart will certainly yield financial and logistical difficulties for many borrowers across the country. A Looming Financial Challenge? The resumption of student loan repayments comes on the heels of weak consumer spending in recent months, the end of other pandemic-era program expansions, and tightening credit markets that also make other debts more expensive and burdensome—deepening the financial stresses that many student borrowers face. While household bank accounts remain in better shape, on average, than before the pandemic due to robust stimulus programs, the cash reserves accumulated have been largely spent down. As a result, some forecasters estimate that 90% of the funds borrowers allocate towards repayments will come from reducing their consumption rather than personal savings. This could modestly impact U.S. economic activity over the coming months, with Morgan Stanley estimating that a drop in consumer spending could yield a decrease of 0.5% in the real Personal Consumption Expenditure Index this fall and that repayments could create a slight drag on economic activity in the fourth quarter. Further, despite the fact that lower-income households typically have borrowed less for postsecondary education than their higher-income counterparts, their outstanding debt tends to be much higher as a percentage of their income. This means the resumption of payments—which will likely not pose significant stress on household finances for most borrowers—could pose a challenge to lower earners, as the lowest two income quintiles will collectively owe around $7 billion per year. These factors suggest that the resumption of student loan payments has the potential to push lower-earning households to the brink of financial insecurity, with the risk of downstream effects during the next economic downturn. The Biden administration has, however, taken steps to alleviate some of this financial pressure, including an “on-ramp plan” that essentially allows nonpayment (or a grace period) for the first 12 months after payments officially restart. Although interest will accrue during this period, nonpayment will not affect a borrower’s credit rating. In addition, many borrowers participate in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which exempt those with incomes below 100% or 150% of the federal poverty level (depending on the specific plan) from monthly payments and limit monthly payments to an affordable share of income for others. The administration is also in the process of rolling out the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which aims to provide IDR on even more generous terms. As a result of these provisions, as well as the ability of some borrowers to go into forbearance or deferment because of financial hardships, out-of-pocket loan payments will likely be&hellip;",

    "content": "As the nation&#8217;s population of older adults rapidly grows, the demand for long-term services and supports (LTSS) is on the rise. LTSS is comprised of institutional care and home and community-based services (HCBS). Most older adults want to remain in the community. However, the United States lacks a national solution to advance high-performing LTSS systems. To address this, BPC evaluated state LTSS system trends using AARP’s LTSS State Scorecards data, which is the only data source comparing LTSS systems across states since 2009. With that information, we have created an infographic outlining existing gaps in LTSS systems and opportunities for bipartisan federal policy reforms to improve those systems. AARP’s LTSS State Scorecards provide a helpful framework for defining the key dimensions of a high-performing LTSS system. While these dimensions continue to evolve in response to a robust stakeholder engagement process, they include: (1) quality of life and quality of care; (2) affordability and access; (3) choice of setting and provider; (4) support for family caregivers; and (5) effective transitions. AARP’s work to develop the LTSS State Scorecard began in 2009 and has culminated in four editions (2011, 2014, 2016, and 2020), with a new scorecard set for release on September 28, 2023. The findings and conclusions expressed herein are a result of our approach and methodology, and do not necessarily reflect the policy views of BPC, its founders, its funders, its board of directors, or other organizations that engaged with BPC on this work. BPC will release a follow-up brief in Spring 2024 using new data from the fifth edition of AARP’s LTSS State Scorecard.

    "content": "The Senate always takes its time. On some level, this is by design to allow senators to sufficiently deliberate issues of national importance. But even by the Senate’s standards, the time it takes to confirm presidential nominees is becoming progressively slower, with the Senate “hold” being a key factor. According to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, the time from nomination to confirmation has climbed steadily since the George W. Bush administration. Consequently, this results in presidents being increasingly hampered during their first year in office, a crucial time for staffing the government. Holds—an informal practice in the Senate—contribute to the slowdown. A hold allows a senator to prevent a matter from receiving a floor vote by informing party leadership of his or her intent to block it. Holds are effective because much of the Senate’s business is accomplished through unanimous consent to deviate from the strictures of the chamber’s glacial rules. One member can accomplish a hold simply by threatening to withhold that consent. Holds are meant to ensure senators are consulted on matters of importance to them and/or their constituents. A senator might place a hold to indicate opposition to a measure or nominee, or to encourage the measure’s sponsor or the White House to negotiate with them. Used sparingly, the practice can improve deliberation. Used maximally, holds can prevent the Senate from accomplishing routine business. Holds are almost always respected by leadership, so there is little to no chance of one being ignored. One hold recently making headlines belongs to Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), who is blocking all Department of Defense nominations from moving forward with the goal of having the Pentagon reverse a policy regarding compensation for certain military personnel seeking abortions. In doing so, Sen. Tuberville has stalled civilian positions and high-ranking military nominations and promotions, including for the Marine Corps, which is without a Senate-confirmed leader. Sen. Tuberville is not the only one using this tactic. Recently, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) announced that, because of the Department of Justice’s indictment of former President Donald Trump, he would put a hold on all DOJ nominees. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) announced a hold on Department of Energy nominations to pressure the Biden administration to produce an action plan for combating radioactive waste in St. Louis. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has a hold on the nominee for the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) recently released a two-month-long hold on State Department nominees over documents on the origins of COVID-19. It’s not just Republicans. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced a hold on nominations to the Environmental Protection Agency to pressure the Biden administration to change policy. Democrats and Republicans also used holds during the Trump administration to slow or block nominees. While holds have an impact on the Senate confirmations, they’re not the only thing hampering the process. The number of nominees that must receive Senate confirmation is another pain point with approximately 1,200 presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed (PAS) positions. This is in&hellip;",

    "content": "In May 2023 a group of representatives. led by Reps. María Elvira Salazar (R-FL) and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), introduced the Dignity Act of 2023. This piece of legislation is a relatively rare, bipartisan attempt at comprehensive immigration reform, addressing the major components of immigration: the border, legal immigration, and the status of the undocumented, including Dreamers. The bill aligns closely with several of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s recommendations to Congress for immigration reform, particularly those regarding improving border security, and legal immigration reform, including enabling more employment-based opportunities, reducing green card backlogs, and providing undocumented immigrants with an opportunity to obtain legal status. While the bill addresses most of the major issues in our domestic immigration system, it does not deal with the so-called “root causes” that are driving much of the current migration in the hemisphere. BPC has recommended such efforts as part of a comprehensive framework to address border security and migration. However, those policies are more in the realm of foreign policy and aid than domestic immigration, which may be why they were not included in this effort. Dignity Act Provisions  The Dignity Act seeks to achieve reform in several key areas of the U.S. immigration system. Regarding the U.S.-Mexico border, it would authorize $25 billion to improve security through both physical and technological infrastructure. It purports to end so-called “catch-and-release policies”—which critics allege allow migrants who have crossed the border to live within communities in the U.S. as opposed to being detained while they wait to go through the U.S. immigration process. Instead, the bill would establish five humanitarian campuses along the U.S.-Mexico border for asylum seekers and enhance screening procedures to ensure decisions are made in a timely manner and that only valid claims are accepted. Screening will include criminal background checks, identity verification, and an interview where migrants must demonstrate credible fear of persecution in their home country—all aimed to be completed within 60 days— before final asylum determinations are made. The bill also seeks to improve U.S. competitiveness through legal immigration reforms that would expand pathways for skilled workers. It would create a new uncapped temporary worker visa program for current long-serving unauthorized farmworkers called Certified Agricultural Worker (CAW) status. After eight years of CAW status, or a total of 10 years of previous agricultural work and four years of CAW status, individuals could apply for green cards. The bill would also expand opportunities for temporary non-agricultural workers—who are crucial for meeting seasonal labor demands—by expanding the definition of “returning worker” to include any worker who entered on an H-2B visa in the last three years and exempting them from the existing 66,000 annual cap on H-2Bs. The bill would reduce immigrant visa backlogs by granting immediate green cards to individuals who have been waiting for more than 10 years, and raising country-specific caps on green cards from 7% to 15% of the total annual limits. It would exempt spouses and minor children of green card holders from annual caps and prevent children of&hellip;",

    "content": "Over the past decade, the Bipartisan Policy Center has issued a series of reports highlighting ways to improve the health of Americans through access to nutritious foods. This year, Congress must reauthorize the farm bill, which supports many of our federal nutrition programs. In advance of that reauthorization, congressional leaders have introduced several bipartisan bills, which echo prior recommendations from BPC and carry the potential to improve the well-being of many Americans. The SNAP Nutrition Security Act of 2023 (S. 2326/H.R. 4909), a bipartisan, bicameral bill introduced by Sens. Booker (D-NJ) and Rubio (R-FL) and Reps. Gottheimer (D-NJ) and Chavez-DeRemer (R-OR), would amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to prioritize access to nutritious foods for those on SNAP. The legislation calls for improved data collection to identify opportunities that would enhance nutrition measures within the program. BPC supports this bill, recognizing that low-income individuals not only deserve access to more food but also healthier options to prevent the increasing burden of chronic diseases. This was a focus of BPC’s work with the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force. BPC task force co-chair José Andrés, along with other important leaders like Hunger Free America, have also voiced support for this legislation. In addition, there have been a series of congressional proposals to modernize Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP)—a program strongly supported by BPC’s task force.  Some of those proposals, including S. 2015/H.R. 4149, the OH SNAP, Close the Fruit and Vegetable Gap Act of 2023, led by Sen. Booker (D-NJ) and Rep. Blunt Rochester (D-DE), highlight important policy goals for GusNIP that the task force would support in principle but acknowledge that the current budget constraints may make enactment difficult. As such, other proposals, such as the bipartisan H.R. 4856, the GusNIP Expansion Act of 2023, led by Reps. Crawford (R-AR) and Kildee (D-MI), S. 2577, the GusNIP Improvement Act of 2023 led by Sen. Hirono (D-HI), may be more feasible additions to the farm bill. In May 2023, Reps. Crockett (D-TX), Alford (R-MO), and several other members of the House introduced H.R. 3127, the Supporting All Healthy Options When Purchasing Produce Act or the SHOPP Act. The goal of this bipartisan legislation is to increase year-round availability of fresh frozen fruits or vegetables through the provision of these foods to SNAP recipients. Previous BPC task force recommendations have acknowledged the need for a stronger emphasis on access to all types of fruits and vegetables. The Senior Nutrition Task Force Act of 2023 (S. 2361) was introduced by Sens. Casey (D-PA) and Collins (R-ME) in July. This bipartisan legislation creates an interagency task force focused on reducing hunger and promoting healthy food among older adults and those with disabilities.  This task force will provide a report to Congress in 2026 about appropriate next steps. BPC Action also extended its support to a bipartisan bill that would increase the delivery of nutritious meals to Medicare beneficiaries. The Medically Tailored Home-Delivery Meals Demonstration Act (S.2133) would establish a 4-year pilot&hellip;",

    "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) ownership is on the rise in the U.S., with key provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) supporting a more rapid transition to EVs and other alternative fuel vehicles. However, increasing EV adoption adds to the financial pressures afflicting the federal Highway Trust Fund, which supports the construction and maintenance of our nation’s highways and transit systems. The HTF receives the majority of its revenue from federal excise taxes on motor fuel, also known as the gas tax. As the nation reduces its gas consumption by continuing its transition to EVs and more fuel-efficient vehicles, policymakers will have to reckon with widening shortfalls for the HTF—and that means finding new sources of revenue to sustain stable federal investment in our nation’s transportation systems. The HTF’s Structural Funding Problem Under the current system, EV owners use highways and bridges constructed and maintained with HTF funding without contributing to the fund’s revenue. EVs are typically heavier than gasoline-powered cars of a similar size and can have a greater impact on road wear and associated costs, though large trucks cause more damage to roads than any type of small passenger vehicle. Although EVs comprise a small percentage of total cars on the road today, EV market penetration is expected to increase rapidly over the next few decades—which means less gas consumption per vehicle and thus less revenue for the HTF. From 2011 to 2021, EV sales in the U.S. increased from 22,000 to more than 2 million. Forecasts for future EV sales and market share vary substantially, and will depend on consumer behavior, public policy, and automaker production. Some estimates indicate EV sales will reach 40 to 50% of all passenger car sales by 2030. Additionally, new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards will require passenger cars and light trucks to satisfy a 49-miles-per-gallon, industry-wide fleet average by 2025, resulting in 200 billion gallons of reduced fuel consumption by 2050 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Even before the proliferation of EVs, the HTF was in trouble. Since the gas tax is not currently indexed to inflation, the purchasing power of the tax has decreased significantly since 1993, when it was last raised. Reduced purchasing power and fuel consumption have led the HTF to become increasingly reliant on transfers from the U.S. Treasury’s general fund to maintain spending at the levels authorized by Congress. Many people might think that highways have sufficient funding with the passage of the BIL in 2021, which included a $118 billion transfer from the general fund to the HTF. However, the BIL merely delayed insolvency for the HTF without addressing the decline in long-term revenue. The latest Congressional Budget Office projection estimates the HTF will be drained by 2028 and reach a cumulative funding deficiency of more than $240 billion by 2033. What Exactly Does the HTF Do?  Gas-powered vehicle drivers pay 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel towards the&hellip;",

This growth, however, can lead to disinformation – information created and disseminated with the intent to mislead. Generative AI may increase the quality, quantity, and targeting capabilities of disinformation which could manipulate the integrity of the information space. This blog will discuss how AI can augment disinformation campaigns and the difficulties policymakers may face in trying to protect against these risks. How Generative AI Augments Disinformation Advances in large language models (LLM) and deep learning (DL) are powering generative AI programs to design extraordinary content, such as composing a sonata, writing a short story in the style of Hemingway, or drawing a Picasso-style landscape painting in seconds. This ability to quickly and efficiently mimic human-generated content (HGC) may aid in the success of AI-generated disinformation making it cheaper, faster, and more effective. Before the widespread rollout of generative AI, threat actors — groups or people who engage in adversarial action — had to employ a network of relatively skilled content creators, outsource message creation to third-party contractors, or distribute low-quality messages. Employing a cohort of skilled writers is expensive, outsourcing may reduce cost but increases operational security risk (like having freelancers talk to the NYT about their experience), and disinformation rife with grammatical errors tends to lack credibility. Generative AI can help bypass these impediments by quickly producing massive amounts of unique and idiomatically correct disinformation that can be extremely convincing. Beyond the ability to enhance the credibility of disinformation campaigns by including high-quality imagery, cybercriminals are leveraging generative AI to augment social engineering campaigns—cybersecurity attacks that use psychology to manipulate people into sharing sensitive information. An emerging trend is for scammers to use AI to mimic the voice of a loved one in need of immediate help. This simple yet effective ploy for quick cash may give way to more sophisticated and targeted attacks. In our increasingly digitally connected world, would it be terribly out of character for a manager to leave a voicemail asking for a coworker to forward a working document? Social engineering attacks are an effective strategy, even against intelligent company employees, and malicious actors are only increasing the efficiency of these attacks. Furthermore, as the number of people and content online continues to increase, hackers will have access to more data allowing them to impersonate more targets which may increase the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.  While students and professionals use generative AI to improve their coding ability, it is also used by cyber criminals to improve malicious code. This ability expands how generative AI can be used– it can author disinformation and write the code that facilitates its distribution, thereby reducing the cost of running an influence operation. This reduction in cost may incentivize existing threat actors to engage in more disinformation campaigns and could even entice new threat actors to run their first influence operations. Together, generative AI&#8217;s ability to create idiomatic&hellip;",

According to Gallup, confidence in higher education has dropped from 57% to 47% among Americans with college degrees and from 67% to 50% among those with postgraduate degrees in the past eight years. This precipitous decline in institutional trust among alumni portends consequential impacts on donations and universities’ public image. Despite this decline, alumni remain dedicated to their alma maters and are essential allies in restoring trust. Today, a new wave of alumni advocacy is growing. In recent years, numerous nonprofit alumni groups formed, primarily focused on promoting free expression, academic freedom, and viewpoint diversity. Twenty of these nonprofit groups joined together under the umbrella of the Alumni Free Speech Alliance (AFSA). AFSA reportedly received membership inquiries from alumni at more than 110 universities in its first two weeks. A member organization at Cornell University states that it has more than 24,000 supporters and followers. This alumni movement’s strong organization and rapid proliferation merit close examination. Improving public confidence will require productive engagement with this highly active constituency. Accordingly, administrators should learn to analyze and operate alongside alumni groups. The following may serve as a guide for engaging with the current alumni advocacy movement. Background on Alumni Advocacy for Free Expression and Viewpoint Diversity The history of American colleges and universities is filled with examples of alumni advocating for free expression, academic freedom, and viewpoint diversity. As early as 1903, events such as the Bassett Affair at Trinity College, later Duke University, demonstrated the propensity of alumni to organize. After Professor John Spencer Bassett praised Booker T. Washington in a journal article, a scathing piece in the Raleigh News &amp; Observer inspired widespread calls for his removal. Some alumni, alongside faculty and students, rallied in support of Bassett, and Trinity’s trustees rejected his resignation. Yale University alumnus William F. Buckley Jr.’s criticism of his alma mater in God and Man at Yale (1951) catalyzed a new alumni advocacy movement. Subtitled The Superstitions of “Academic Freedom,” his denunciation of Yale’s academic trajectory sparked a national conversation about free inquiry in higher education. This raised significant skepticism among alumni, who would thereafter play a more direct role in shaping decisions on campus. Other alumni saw donations as an opportunity to affect change. In 1992, Yale alumnus Lee M. Bass donated $20 million to expand Yale’s Western civilization curriculum to boost study of a topic he saw as underemphasized. Four years later, Bass demanded that Yale return his gift for failing to meet his curricular conditions. Alumni have sought to influence their alma maters by attaining leadership positions. In 2006, alumni at Dartmouth College and Hamilton College attempted to place “outsider” candidates onto the schools ’governing boards in response to free speech controversies on campus. At Colgate University, a group called Students &amp; Alumni for Colgate engaged in recruiting efforts to place alumni on the university’s advisory board. In 2021, Yale&hellip;",

Ginnie Mae, more formally known as the Government National Mortgage Association, plays a critical role in the U.S. housing finance system, providing a full faith and credit guaranty for nearly $2.5 trillion in securities consisting of mortgages insured by the federal government. McCargo discussed Ginnie Mae’s role in expanding homeownership to low- and moderate-income households, her thoughts on the biggest challenges currently facing the housing finance industry, and how she envisions the agency evolving in the future. A transcript of the event is available here. To set the stage, McCargo gave an overview of Ginnie Mae’s mission, highlighting the work the agency does to back government mortgages to low- and moderate-income populations and other underserved communities including veterans, Native Americans, and those living in rural areas. She discussed her primary areas of focus so far in her two years as president of Ginnie Mae, including managing risks associated with the shift in the underlying issuer base of Ginnie Mae from banks to independent mortgage bankers and non-banking entities. She also spoke about her experience leading the agency out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to expand access to the agency’s platform for smaller lenders like community development finance agencies and credit unions. McCargo highlighted how closing the racial homeownership gap has been a priority for the Biden administration. She explained how Ginnie Mae, by supporting the majority of first-time homebuyers across the country, is advancing that goal. Before concluding, the discussion turned to the future of the housing finance industry broadly and Ginnie Mae specifically. McCargo highlighted the agency’s transition to the cloud and its improved access to data as vital advancements that have allowed the agency to continue to expand its reach and ensure its long-term success. She also discussed the way that tracking additional data has allowed Ginnie Mae to generate new interest from ESG-conscious funds. She emphasized that Ginnie Mae has not changed how it performs its functions, stating that at its heart the agency has always been a social enterprise but now is able to provide more detailed information to investors.

    "content": "Several neurotechnology companies have developed implantable brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). A BMI is a device that translates neuronal information into commands capable of controlling external software or hardware, such as a computer or robotic arm. BMIs are often used as assisted living devices for people with motor or sensory impairments. The devices&#8217; main objective is to monitor brain activity and provide electrical stimulation which enables brain-computer interactions.  By using this technology, people with paralysis, blindness, deafness, or speech impairment could potentially regain control over their electronic devices using their thoughts, opening new possibilities for improving their quality of life. Current Status of Neurotechnology Research In essence, the development and approval of medical devices encompasses a comprehensive sequence of stages, each involving innovation, safety, and advancement in healthcare.  Privacy laws and regulations are key components that intersect with the innovation of these technologies. Both in the United States and abroad, there are comprehensive privacy laws that could oversee how brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are utilized. For instance, the European Union’s (GDPR) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) define biometric information broadly, implying that neurodata could fall under their rules. Examples of biometric data include fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, voiceprints, and more. Neurodata, which refers to data collected from the brain or nervous system, could potentially be considered a type of biometric data if neurodata is used to identify people or could potentially be used in such a manner. Neurotechnology research is still in the early stages. If these privacy laws are triggered, they impose specific obligations on organizations that are regulated by them, while also granting certain rights to people whose data is being processed. Neurodata processing may lead to additional rules under these laws. For instance, if a healthcare facility employs BCI technology to oversee patients&#8217; neural patterns and identify potential signs of neurological conditions, this utilization of neurodata would fall within the purview of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States. The institution would need to ensure the collection, storage, and sharing of patients&#8217; neurodata comply with HIPAA&#8217;s stringent regulations on safeguarding sensitive health information. Additionally, if courts determine that the neurodata, including brainwave patterns, contain biometric identifiers or are covered by statutory definitions of biometric data, it could trigger obligations under state-specific laws like Illinois&#8217; Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which requires obtaining informed consent and protecting biometric data from unauthorized access. In a significant milestone toward conducting human clinical trials in the United States, another neurotech company recently obtained an investigational device exemption (IDE) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This exemption grants permission to utilize their device in clinical studies. However, detailed information regarding the specifics of these trials, including their scope, focus, and design, has not been publicly disclosed. Privately held companies are not obligated to provide extensive details about their regulatory interactions with the FDA, making it challenging to gain a comprehensive understanding of the approval process and trial parameters.

    "content": "Homelessness is a salient policy issue across the country, but its prevalence among college students remains under-discussed. As tuition costs skyrocket, evidence suggests a significant number of students are left struggling to meet their basic needs and experiencing housing instability which can have devastating consequences for their academic performance and future prospects. In February, BPC released a report on Housing Supply and the Drivers of Homelessness examining the relationship between homelessness and housing supply and identifying commonsense, evidence-based solutions to address homelessness. This blog expands on that research by delving into the available data on housing insecurity and homelessness among college students, identifying factors that contribute to these issues, and proposing recommendations across higher education and housing policy to address the problem. Affordability Challenges in Higher Education Over the past two decades, the cost of tuition, fees, room and board (TFRB) has increased by 32% at public four-year institutions, 26% at private non-profits, and 11% at public two-year schools. The cost of TFRB at four-year public colleges and universities has risen about two and half times faster than the median family income, which has grown 13% during that 20-year period. Many students rely heavily on grants and loans to pay for their college education. However, federal student aid assistance has failed to keep pace with growing costs, putting major strains on students&#8217; budgets. In 2020, the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice conducted the #RealCollege Survey of more than 195,000 students. Of those surveyed, 58% reported experiencing basic needs insecurity, defined as experiencing some form of food insecurity, homelessness, or housing insecurity—which encompasses a range of challenges to accessing stable housing. In the 12 months prior to the survey, 14% of respondents reported experiencing homelessness and 48% experienced some form of housing insecurity. Recent federal and state-level data similarly highlight a noteworthy portion of students grappling with housing instability. The 2020 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study,  which is grounded in a nationally representative sample, indicates that approximately 8% of undergraduate students experienced homelessness in the 30 days prior to filling out the survey. A review of nationwide studies by California’s Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council estimates homelessness affects 12% of community college students and 9% of university students over a 12-month period. Students who are housing insecure are less likely to complete their degree and are at a higher risk for other basic needs insecurities. Many students who fail to complete their degree programs often find themselves burdened with substantial student debt without the increased earnings associated with degree attainment. Those who do not finish their degrees are more likely to face difficulties in repaying loans and default. By ensuring that students experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity have the resources they need to succeed academically, policymakers can help to mitigate the financial risks associated with student loan defaults and foster long-term economic stability for these individuals. College Students and the Crisis of Affordable Housing  Most undergraduates in the United States live off-campus, relying on local housing markets for a&hellip;",

    "content": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment insurance (UI) system experienced high levels of fraud, as state-run programs across the country were targeted by sophisticated attacks, often committed by foreign criminal organizations. The monetary losses were substantial: According to the Government Accountability Office, improper payments in the UI system amounted to at least $60 billion (and potentially much more) during the pandemic. Preventing this level of fraud from occurring again should be a priority for federal and state lawmakers. Fortunately, policymakers have at least one tool to begin addressing the problem: The Integrity Data Hub (IDH), which helps identify suspicious UI claims through interstate data sharing. Understanding and strengthening the role of IDH is a crucial step not only to prevent fraud but also to ensure equitable access to benefits through the digital transformation of UI. What Is IDH? Run by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, IDH allows states to share claims data with each other in order to identify suspicious activity. All states and territories adopted IDH during the pandemic, and as of June 2023, the tool has helped prevent $3 billion in improper payments. IDH relies on three key features to efficiently detect fraud: Cross-matching: Compares UI claims against interstate databases to flag fraud risk. Efficient verification: Verifies critical personal information in a UI claim. Fraud schemes information sharing: Enables states to share emerging fraud schemes systematically with other states. Cross-matching Against Databases When a state receives a UI claim, IDH enables that state to compare a claimant&#8217;s email domain with a database of emails previously associated with fraudulent activities. In addition, IDH has a Suspicious Actor Repository, which stores previously investigated claims across states, including those confirmed or suspected to be fraudulent. By comparing a new claim with the repository, a state can determine whether the claim is associated with previous high-risk claims on a national scale. IDH also flags whether the same claimant information is filed in multiple states through Multi-State Cross-Match (MSCM). For example, MSCM can identify when an individual uses the same Social Security number to file claims in different states, flagging the new and previous claims as high risk of fraud. Efficient Verification IDH helps quickly verify the key information within UI claims. Specifically, IDH compares the claimant’s identity with Social Security Administration records and thus enables states to evaluate the likelihood of false or stolen identities. IDH also enables states to verify bank accounts based on near real-time information. In particular, a state can validate the account’s status and determine whether the claimant is authorized as the account owner or user. Finally, IDH helps states identify any foreign IP addresses associated with a claim. Using all this information, IDH provides a score for each claimant, indicating the level of risk associated with the claimant and detailing the factors driving that score. Fraud Schemes Information Sharing IDH contains a fraud-alert system that enables states to elevate emerging fraud patterns for one another. This includes allowing a state to share anecdotal fraud schemes&hellip;",

    "content": "The American Congressional Exchange program offers members of Congress the opportunity to build trust across party lines while sharing experiences away from the pressures of Washington, DC. Members of Congress go beyond the normal, essential process of focusing on their constituents’ issues to visit another member&#8217;s district to better understand a colleague across the aisle. Through ACE, members gain a deeper understanding of each other’s backgrounds. The idea seems simple yet has generated groundbreaking discussions. As Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) said during his trip with Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), “The opportunity to go out to each other’s districts and learn a little bit about it probably helps us highlight those opportunities we didn’t know existed.” Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA) and Rep. William Timmons (R-SC) went on ACE’s very first back-to-back trips together to Atlanta, Georgia, and Greenville, South Carolina. In Atlanta, the two had the opportunity to meet with small business leaders and learn about workforce shortage concerns that Rep. Timmons understood but was now able to compare with his district’s labor challenges. As participants on ACE trips have discovered, once members begin to talk with one another about the issues their constituents are experiencing on the ground, it becomes easier to find opportunities for fresh thinking, collaboration, and compromise. This helps to overcome the partisan divide we are now experiencing on a national level. As a recent study by Brown University documented, the United States is becoming more polarized at a faster rate than other countries. Although many people point to sharply partisan media outlets, social media silos, and the homogeneity of party ideologies as causes of this polarization, political scientists also attribute it to the nationalization of political discussion. Political scientist Daniel J. Hopkins argues “nationalized political behavior is likely to change politicians’ incentives in ways that make it harder to build legislative coalitions.” It is clear “nationalized political behavior” has become the norm and is creating more hostility among members. According to a recent poll, 77% of Americans now disapprove of Congress. ACE provides one means of shifting the conversation from the national to the local level, allowing members to connect on a personal basis. It provides members opportunities to engage in civil discussions. Members who go on ACE trips often hold opposing viewpoints, but the experience of the trip enables them to trust each other more, identify areas of shared priorities, and pursue additional cross-party conversations. As Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) said, &#8220;You can’t work with people you don’t trust, and you can’t trust people you don’t know.&#8221; The ACE program builds the trust that encourages members to collaborate in the future and helps decrease the ‘national political culture’ that is sweeping America.",

    "content": "Since 1951, North Dakota has stood alone as the only state without formal voter registration. There have been multiple legislative efforts to reinstate voter registration, but all have failed as the majority of governors, secretaries of state, and other policymakers believe voter registration to be costly and restrictive for the state’s election ecosystem. North Dakota serves as proof that states can maintain efficient, low-barrier, and secure voter rolls without formal voter registration. Its system—while unique—can be replicated in other states through policies like same-day and automatic voter registration. Without a requirement for registration, the process of voting in North Dakota is straightforward. Qualified returning electors show up at their precinct, present a valid form of identification containing their name, current residential address, and date of birth, and then have their name and address verified using the precinct poll book generated from the permanent central voter file. In a similar process, new voters present their identification to a clerk, who then adds the voter’s information to the poll book. If a voter’s identification does not contain all the required components, they have the option to present supplementary documentation such as a utility bill or paycheck. In cases where voters do not have this documentation with them, they are allowed to fill out a provisional ballot on the condition that they present proper identification before canvassing. The central voter file is North Dakota’s primary safeguard in maintaining secure elections. Created in 2008 in collaboration with the North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT), the file is kept up to date via regular reports from NDDOT, the state health officer, the state court administrator, and the director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The large number of agencies feeding data into the voter file enables North Dakota to maintain a comprehensive voter list without a duty on voters to complete registration. In essence, the state is an early pioneer of what is now referred to as automatic voter registration. The voter file is maintained by county auditors and the secretary of state to prevent and identify any attempts at fraud, ensure accuracy of active and inactive voter lists, and produce critical materials like precinct poll books and reports. The secretary of state is also charged with auditing the central voter file after each election to ensure there was no double voting or out-of-jurisdiction voting. To ensure transparency and uphold the integrity of elections, poll books are open records—meaning anyone can request an active voter list at any time—and voter lists can legally be generated and shared with other states. This approach to voting has worked well in the past because of North Dakota’s primarily rural population, but some precincts are growing rapidly as residents move into cities like Fargo and Bismarck, making it difficult for election boards to determine who is a qualified elector. When local officials don’t know how many voters to expect, it becomes challenging to know how many resources to allocate to which voting sites (for example, how many paper&hellip;",

    "content": "The explosion of ChatGPT usage is capturing the public’s imagination, alighting dreams of surging economic prosperity and inducing fears of runaway Artificial Intelligence. This focus on long-term macro impacts is crowded out by discussions of where and how AI is making an impact today and the more immediate challenges the technology presents. Appreciating this dynamic, this blog aims to encourage creative thought about how AI policies will impact today’s industry by drawing on a handful of cases where AI is already creating beneficial opportunities and introducing risks. Cheaper, Faster Therapies For Those In Need | Improved Pathogen Development Shockingly, an estimated 86% of drug candidates created between 2000 and 2015 failed to meet their objectives. This failure rate can contribute to several aspects of the pharmaceutical market, such as expensive therapies and extended product development timelines. To address these issues, some firms are turning to AI to enhance their ability to design novel molecules, analyze experimental data, and inject innovation into the pharmaceutical development process. While it is still too early to understand AI&#8217;s full impact in this sector, it may drive down costs, increase research velocity, and allow firms to engage in previously unprofitable therapy areas. Unfortunately, the same qualities that make AI an attractive tool to improve pharmaceutical development can also make it dangerous as it can be used to develop biological and chemical weapons. In the same way that AI can reduce the cost and time to develop pharmaceutical therapies, it could also be used to facilitate the production of novel or exigent pathogens. The clear benefits and risks of AI in this sector highlight the need for policymakers to engage with domain experts to understand the nuance of how to encourage innovation without unwittingly encouraging malicious behavior or allowing for the development of unintended risks. Expanded Financial Inclusion | Market Manipulation And Collusion AI has been present in the financial markets for years, but new applications of AI have paved the way for potential innovative benefits. One area with increasing adoption is the rollout of AI-augmented account management services, such as automatic portfolio rebalancing, to a broader swath of consumers. While these systems could pose consumer risks if they lack adequate consumer protections and safeguards, if properly implemented and regulated, AI-augmented financial systems may increase financial inclusion.  It could also help reduce inequality by giving a larger swath of the population access to financial services and instruments previously reserved for only the highest net wealth investors. As such, the use of AI in finance may benefit society by expanding financial inclusion, but it may also create unique risks and concerns. Studies have shown that exigent AI trading models have already independently “discovered” and attempted to leverage illegal trading practices such as spoofing. As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent, more algorithms will discover and attempt to leverage illegal tactics even if their programmers never intended to encourage such behavior. Furthermore, as companies begin using increasingly complex models such as deep learning and neural networks, it can&hellip;",

    "content": "The Brief A new Harris Poll commissioned by BPC’s Funding Our Future coalition and DailyPay shows that 90% of Americans find managing their finances stressful, with 65% anxious about their current financial situation. Black workers’ financial situation is particularly precarious—66% report not always having enough cash on hand to pay their bills, compared to only 44% of white workers. Despite this, Black workers are taking active steps to shore up their finances at notably higher rates than other racial groups and report strikingly positive feelings about their current financial situation and the broader economic outlook. Overall, many Americans remain in bad financial straits, highlighting the need for policymakers to advance prudent economic policies that expand opportunity and financial security. Despite economic forecasters’ brightening expectations, a recent survey of more than 2,000 adults in the U.S. shows many continue to face severe financial pressures. While inflation has cooled rapidly over the past year—from nearly 9% in June 2022 to 3% in June 2023—nearly 9 in 10 respondents (87%) report that price increases have negatively impacted their finances. As a result, over one-third of respondents (34%) report doing worse financially than a year ago, compared to only one-quarter (25%) doing better. Twice as many report saving less now than they did last year (42%) than report saving more (21%). Consequently, it is no surprise that 90% currently find managing their finances stressful. Among working-age respondents (ages 18 to 64), nearly two-thirds (65%) report feeling anxious about their current financial situation, and only 1 in 10 (10%) report having no anxiety at all. And although working-age women are participating in the labor force at record rates, women report more anxiety about their finances than do men. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated economic disparities along racial lines, with Black households experiencing higher levels of unemployment, debt, and food insufficiency compared to white households. Even after Black unemployment reached a record low in April 2023, Black households still held the smallest cash balances of any racial group, and the Black unemployment rate has edged back up to 2022 levels. This economic hardship has taken a toll on Black households’ financial wellbeing. Significantly more Black respondents (66%) than white respondents (48%) report not always having enough cash on hand to pay their bills. And among those who do not always have enough cash on hand, Black respondents are far more likely to report turning to payday loans (22% vs. 8% of white respondents), while half of white respondents report using a credit card and paying it off over time (50% vs. 36% of Black respondents). Despite these challenges, however, Black respondents report significantly more optimism about the path forward than their white counterparts. Thirty-six percent of Black respondents—compared to only 21% of white respondents—say they are doing better financially than a year ago, and Black respondents report saving more at nearly twice the rate of white respondents (34% vs. 18%). In addition, Black respondents are strikingly optimistic about the U.S. economy when compared to white&hellip;",

    "content": "Listen to this post as read by the author: https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copyright-and-AI.m4a Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology. Its increasing use and popularity spawn new copyright questions and concerns regarding the works these tools produce and the materials used for their training. The usage of current innovations such as ChatGPT and Midjourney has encouraged new engagement in the creative community. Now, anyone can use generative AI to produce creative works, such as literary, artistic, or musical. Existing artists are also using AI to amplify their creative abilities. An example is the MoMA&#8217;s collection created by the artist Refik Anadol who used AI to interpret and transform the museum&#8217;s data set to create new art forms, resulting in a high-resolution dream of a modern art collection. Thus, generative AI has unlocked new possibilities for innovation. However, like any emerging technology, generative AI also raises challenges requiring consideration from policymakers. For instance, the recent Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists union strike highlights the concern many have about the potential of AI to write screenplays and create characters without any human involvement resulting in significant job displacement. Their concern extends to copyright protection, as ChatGPT and Midjourney scripts could incorporate elements from existing filmmakers&#8217; works, leading to copyright issues. Addressing the various policy challenges with copyright policy and law is crucial to encourage innovation and foster creativity in the United States. Overview of Generative AI Technologies and Copyright Protection Generative AI is a recent advanced iteration of AI technology. It takes a user’s instructions, or “input”, and creates new text, visual or audio materials, or “outputs”, by drawing from preexisting works used for their training. The concerns around generative AI and copyright protection revolve mainly around determining authorship in AI-generated works, the level of human involvement required for copyright protection, and the potential infringement of copyrights by AI outputs. These questions address the areas of authorship, fair use, and infringement in the evolving field of generative AI content, requiring careful evaluation within copyright law and policy. The Human Authorship Requirement The U.S. Copyright Office (the &#8220;Office&#8221;), a federal agency tasked with administering the copyright registration system and advising Congress on copyright and related matters, issued a policy statement with guidelines for evaluating and registering works that incorporate content generated using artificial intelligence technology. Human authorship is a crucial principle that guides the evaluation of AI-generated content under copyright protection. Determining whether AI outputs can be eligible for copyright protection depends on the notion of &#8220;authorship.&#8221; The Office established that copyright exclusively protects content that originates from human creativity. “Copyright law is limited to the original intellectual conceptions of the author, and the Office will reject registration claims if it determines a person did not create the work.” However, generative AI outputs have made the Office evaluate the authorship requirement combined with material generated “by or with the assistance of technology.” When conducting this evaluation, the Office looks to whether the work primarily stems from human authorship,&hellip;",

The focus on protecting children online has taken center stage in the latest push to pass comprehensive data privacy legislation. Just before August recess, two children’s online safety and privacy bills – S. 1418, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) and S. 1409, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) – passed unanimously out of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. These bills previously passed out of Committee in the 117th Congress but failed to progress to the Senate floor. Why This Matters These bills highlight the growing concerns around safeguarding the well-being of youth online. We identified this growing trend toward children’s data privacy in 2022, and the momentum to pass a federal standard is again evident: several states have introduced and even passed children’s data privacy and online safety laws. The Biden Administration, through the State of the Union Address and Executive actions, continues to call on Congress to strengthen protections for children’s privacy, health, and safety online. Moreover, key children’s advocacy groups spoke favorably about these bills. Additionally, the implications of these bills could extend beyond children’s online privacy. They could significantly impact the larger digital landscape, such as using artificial intelligent systems and content moderation techniques. We have discussed the complexities of legislating in this policy trifecta, and how resulting laws could greatly shape online experiences. Policymakers must be aware of these effects as they design and shape legislation. KOSA and COPPA 2.0 The Kids Online Safety Act, originally introduced in 2022 by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), was reintroduced in May 2023. The newly amended bill that passed Committee seeks to establish legal standards to protect “minors” (defined to include people under the age of 17) from online harms, such as content promoting self-harm, eating disorders, substance abuse, and others. The amendments notably modify the duty of care which refers to the responsibility of online service providers to design and operate their products in a way that prioritizes the protection of children from potential dangers. Of particular significance, Sen. John Thune (R-SD) added an amendment to KOSA that mandates companies notify users if their content is filtered using algorithms and offers an opt-out option. The Children and Teen’s Online Privacy Protection Act, originally introduced in 2021 by Sens. Edward Markey (D-MA) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), was also reintroduced in May 2023. This amended bill seeks to update the existing Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Key provisions in COPPA 2.0 include banning targeted ads to minors and extending privacy protections to users aged 13 to 16. Key Issues While the passage of these bills through the committee signifies positive steps toward protecting children online, other issues are still up for debate. One area currently being debated around these bills is their potential impact on minority groups or LGBTQIA+ communities. Specific parental controls and consent requirements included&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 13, BPC Senior Advisor Tim Doyle testified before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets on the proxy process. During the hearing. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK) asked for a description of the proxy process. Below further explains the testimony provided in response to that question. Proxy Process in Corporate Governance In the context of corporate governance, the proxy process is a mechanism to allow beneficial owners (shareholders) the ability to vote either by mail or to designate a fiduciary to act as their agent to vote on their behalf at annual general meetings. This is a practical solution to avoid having shareholders attend multiple meetings scheduled at various companies across the country. Since the growth of public markets from the 1900s, and in particular since the end of World War II, there has been constant tension between shareholder rights and corporate boards and executive management. This tension has been at the center of the proxy process and has correspondingly resulted in a long history of litigation. The tension has been amplified by the fact that, since the 1990s, the ownership of publicly traded companies has become much more concentrated through investments managed by institutional investors. As mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and pension funds continued to grow over the years, encompassing ever larger and more diverse sectors of publicly traded companies, there was a perceived need to vote on proposals in an increasing number of annual meetings. This need was bolstered by SEC regulatory action and the Department of Labor’s issuance of the “Avon Letter” in the 1980s, which emphasized fiduciary duty and the importance of proxy voting. Ultimately, this need created the market for proxy advisors and their ability to review proxy materials at thousands of companies and provide analysis and recommendations. How they develop their recommendations and how those recommendations impact voting results is an issue of increasing concern. Furthermore, in conjunction with the proxy process, Rule 14a-8 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 provides the framework for shareholders to request that their individual proposals be voted on at corresponding shareholder annual meetings. These proposals, if not otherwise excludable under 14a-8&#8217;s provisions, would be included in the proxy materials provided to all shareholders before the next annual meeting. As a result, the subject matter of suggested shareholder proposals and determining who ultimately decides how to vote on those proposals is increasingly debated. This issue is compounded by the fact that the beneficial owners of the shares have increasingly designated, by proxy, their voting rights to third parties, who in turn rely on proxy advisor recommendations for a variety of reasons. Further, under the current policy of the SEC, shareholder proposals dealing with broader societal issues, that might have otherwise been excluded under Rule 14a-8, are now being more readily included in proxy materials. Conclusion The changing process by which corporate policy is voted and acted upon makes the proxy process a vitally important part of corporate governance. The importance of the process&hellip;",

    "content": "Amid the current debate in Washington, DC, around U.S. competitiveness issues, BPC has been crossing the nation to gather local perspectives through roundtable discussions with private and public sector leaders. One of these conversations included a stop in Fort Worth, TX, to hear how competitiveness is defined and supported in the region, from local infrastructure to workforce preparedness. Fast Facts: Fort Worth, TX Economic powerhouse | While it often gets lumped in with Dallas as part of an enormous “metroplex,” Fort Worth alone is the nation’s 13th largest city. Combined with Dallas and surrounding communities in nearby counties, Fort Worth and the North Texas region generate more economic activity than most states. If it were a country, its GDP would rank 24th in the world. Growing and diverse | Fort Worth’s population has grown by 20% since 2010. More than half of its population identifies as a racial or ethnic minority. Competitiveness contributors | The aerospace, advanced energy, and life sciences industries are significant and growing sectors of Fort Worth’s economy. Building Blocks of Competitiveness Much of the roundtable discussion revolved around what can be thought of as the “building blocks” or “micro aspects” of competitiveness. Participants highlighted several different factors that need to be addressed for an economy to be competitive and largely saw these as something government should provide. As one person said, “You can’t have a competitive, stable city without addressing and meeting basic needs.” Topping that list was infrastructure that supports all businesses and people to participate fully in the digital economy. Participants spoke about the need for better broadband, “super-fast internet,” and a “technology backbone” that supports all manner of economic activity—not just a narrow conception of high-tech businesses. Participants also highlighted the role of transportation infrastructure in facilitating economic growth.  As Fort Worth’s population continues to grow, mobility issues—including streets and public transit—are top of mind to many. Other participants pointed to water and education, including public libraries, as important building blocks that can create a foundation for economic activity to thrive. With basic needs met and infrastructure in place to nurture growth, participants zeroed in on the importance of capital to help entrepreneurs finance new businesses and pursue innovative technologies. One participant summed it up by saying, “If we’re going to say we want to be more innovative and competitive, we have to make it easier to get funding for those who want to take the risk.” Corporate Engagement Participants acknowledged the important contributions that large corporations make in fostering an economically prosperous local economy and the role these companies play in helping Fort Worth compete with other cities. At the same time, some participants expressed a desire for corporations to engage differently—both in the community and in how they use their assets. Several participants were critical of what they called a “corporate mindset” that emphasizes short-term outcomes over longer-term goals. This was expressed by one participant who said, “shareholder primacy is a real problem for competitiveness. Profits going to shareholders doesn’t help&hellip;",

    "content": "My struggle with severe anxiety is real. I have experienced mental health crises. But I’m lucky. You may wonder why, when I’ve just admitted my mental health struggles, I would feel that way, and it comes down to privilege: While many psychiatrists and other mental health specialists don’t participate in insurance networks, leaving plenty of people with few or no options, I have been fortunate to be able to find and afford out-of-network care. Last month, the Biden administration took bold regulatory action with a proposed rule that could begin to address this issue, improving access to mental health and substance use care for millions of Americans. While this move would dramatically enhance requirements from a 2008 landmark law known as the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), the administration should consider incorporating several Bipartisan Policy Center proposals to further close the enormous gap between the need for and access to behavioral health care. Though I’ve been fortunate to find much needed mental health treatment, my challenge finding in-network care is not unique. In recent years, the federal government achieved only limited success in enforcing parity laws that require health plans to cover physical and behavioral health equally. Available providers are often too far away, lack timely appointments, or are simply not the right fit for patients. Because so many providers don’t accept insurance, care ends up being too expensive for many Americans, who then either defer or discontinue care. With behavioral health problems on the rise and a growing shortage of specialists, the situation is urgent. The proposed rule takes several critical steps toward improving parity requirements. Many of the proposals align with policy recommendations made by BPC and would help others struggling with anxiety or other mental health issues receive care. The following is a breakdown of four key pieces of the administration’s rule and opportunities to include some of BPC’s recommendations. Closing existing loopholes around parity rules  When the MHPAEA passed in 2008, nonfederal governmental health plans (e.g., plans for state and local government employees) were not subject to parity rules. Under the proposed rule, that loophole would be closed and congressional changes to MHPAEA—specifically “requiring more than 200 additional health plans to comply with MHPAEA”—would be codified. However, the proposed rule does not specify how it would achieve this goal, so the Biden administration should consider two of BPC’s proposals.  In our April 2022 report, BPC recommended the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Labor close this loophole by ensuring state and federal regulators enforce parity activities and report the steps they take.  We also recommended increased funding for parity enforcement of Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) plans. While additional funds may require action from Congress or budget reallocations within agencies, it would be a worthwhile investment that lowers the overall costs of patient care.  While this may seem trivial to patients, enforcing parity rules for all eligible health plans means that fewer professionals, like the ones I&hellip;",

    "content": "Labor is a critical factor of production—its supply, allocation, and demand—and is thus a central component of a nation’s economic competitiveness. The last century of American growth could be broadly summarized as a succession of labor market waves that reshaped all three dimensions of production: Supply: The high school movement in the first four decades of the 20th century and the mass entry of women into the labor force beginning mid-century boosted aggregate labor supply. Allocation: Rising postsecondary enrollment and periods of immigration from countries around the globe altered the allocation of the labor force in terms of skills. Demand: Technological change, especially the information technology revolution, shifted overall demand for workers and created new skill-specific needs. Today, concerns over U.S. competitiveness have raised pressing questions over labor supply, its allocation, and demand for workers. Supply side and allocation issues: Will there be enough workers—and enough workers with the necessary skills? Business leaders from the C-suite to Main Street continue to express concern over a squeeze in labor supply exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This short-term challenge is rooted in longer-term demographic trends, with baby boomers continuing to age and retire, and a slowing birth rate, which promise to shape the labor market for years to come. Demand side issues: Will there be enough need for workers? Rapid advances in the capability of artificial intelligence (AI) tools have raised both fear and anticipation regarding the impact on the quantity and distribution of jobs. As policymakers wrestle with these questions, they should consider pathways to expand labor supply and participation and address the potential impact of emerging technology on the labor market. Supply and Allocation Challenges Over the first two decades of the 21st century, as a falling share of Americans worked or actively sought work, the main question regarding labor supply was, “why is labor force participation falling?” Figure 1. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, via FRED, Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In January 2001, the U.S. labor force participation rate stood close to its peak. From there, it fell five percentage points by September 2015, then rose in subsequent years with economic expansion. Unsurprisingly, labor force participation fell during the pandemic. It has steadily recovered since then but remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. There remain millions of “missing workers,” keeping the overall labor market tight. Researchers have identified various factors contributing to these trends. Some point to demand-side drivers such as outsourcing, trade, and automation. Others cite supply-side factors, including skills deficits, the opioid epidemic, and disincentives created by some safety net programs. Even as the participation rate has fluctuated, labor force composition has shifted. Since 2001, the decline in labor force participation has been much steeper for men than women and for high school graduates than those with college degrees. Looming over all of this is an aging and slow-growing population, which will weigh on aggregate labor force supply. Many economists expect declines in fertility and overall population growth to constrict the supply of American workers. And while&hellip;",

    "content": "Amid debate in Washington, D.C. about American competitiveness, BPC has been crossing the country to understand local and regional competitiveness efforts. Previously, we held roundtables in Tampa and Pittsburgh. The most recent roundtable, hosted by the University of Texas at San Antonio, offered several key insights on three areas in particular: water, workforce, and woes at the border. Fast Facts: San Antonio Large and growing: San Antonio is one of the 10 largest cities in the country and keeps getting bigger. Since 2020, San Antonio has enjoyed some of the largest increases in population of any American city. Diverse and inclusive: According to the Brookings Institution’s latest Metro Monitor, San Antonio takes the top spot among 56 “very large” metro areas in “geographic inclusion” and ranks 11th in racial inclusion. Economically dynamic: San Antonio is a top 20 metro area in terms of economic growth, according to Brookings. The Milken Institute’s Best Performing Cities index charts healthy rates of job and wage growth in San Antonio. On the Economic Innovation Group’s Distressed Communities Index, San Antonio is rated as “comfortable.” From Strengths to Challenges to Opportunities Those assets and positive trends were highlighted by roundtable participants: “We have a dynamic population of people who come into San Antonio and decide to stay.” Nevertheless, roundtable participants were clear-eyed about the need to address “weak spots” and the potential for even greater growth: “Our competitiveness is extraordinary if you take a long-term view.” They approached the discussion of competitiveness from the perspective of building on existing strengths and leveraging the city’s growth to address persistent challenges. The federal government, when it talks about competitiveness, may have in mind China and artificial intelligence. Those issues aren’t lost on public and private leaders in San Antonio. But they recognize that social and economic dynamism requires a much more granular strategy. Infrastructure Basics A city or region can’t hope to remain competitive very long if it doesn’t provide fundamentals such as reliable electricity and safe water. Those are the “foundations of competitiveness.” Despite evident challenges in Texas and other parts of the southwestern United States, attendees felt that San Antonio had addressed them in a serious and long-term way. Environmentalism regarding the water supply, in terms of conservation and planning, “is part of our economic competitiveness” and “how we pitch the city.” Transportation infrastructure, too, is a foundational element of regional competitiveness. Airport modernization is on the local agenda and roundtable participants emphasized the economic importance of Interstate 35, which runs from Duluth, MN, to the U.S.-Mexico border and is a vital trade artery. The federal government signaled its commitment to upgrading American infrastructure with bipartisan passage in 2021 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Workforce Matters Just as fundamental to regional competitiveness is the local workforce. Roundtable participants highlighted three dimensions of workforce: upskilling, recruitment, and pipeline. Several attendees focused on credentialing and raising the skill level of the region’s existing workers. Employers and local leaders are wrestling with questions like, “how do&hellip;",

    "content": "Overview Point-of-view: you are walking downtown. Looking to your left, a group of teenagers are filming a dance challenge video on TikTok. Looking to your right, someone is tweeting their thoughts on the Barbie movie on Twitter. Looking in front of you, your friend is posting a cute picture of their dog on Instagram. In today’s digital age, a startling amount of user-generated content is posted to the internet every minute (as depicted by the chart below). In 2023, more than 4.9 billion people reported using social media as a place to learn, connect, share, and express themselves. Some of our greatest achievements and memories are shared first on these platforms. However, social media can also spread cyberbullying, information disorder, extremist and illegal content. So how do social media companies filter out potentially dangerous content? That is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. Under Section 230 protections, online services have built and deployed powerful content moderation systems—a combination of human moderators and AI. As AI plays a more prominent role in moderating online speech, it is open to more scrutiny because transparency around how algorithms operate AI-powered social media platforms is not yet broadly accessible. This complex technology can be hard for the average internet user to understand, making accountability difficult to articulate and enforce. In this post, we will help answer a few questions that some may have about social media algorithms. How do they work? Who designs them? Why do they function in a particular way? What Are They? According to the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act, an algorithm “means a computational process that uses machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence techniques, or other computational processing techniques of similar or greater complexity and that makes a decision or facilitates human decision-making with respect to covered data, including to determine the provision of products or services or to rank, order, promote, recommend, amplify, or similarly determine the delivery or display of information to an individual.” Basically, algorithms are coded instructions that tell a computer system how to operate. Algorithms are important to AI because they make the system smarter and faster by allowing it to learn and improve its performance. Social media companies employ computer scientists and software engineers to build algorithms into the platform design process. The mathematical formulas are written for a variety of use cases, such as sorting data, automating decision-making, and enforcing a company’s internal community guidelines, terms and conditions, or trust and safety policies. These AI tools allow digital platforms to process user-generated content at a speed and scale that is not possible using human moderators. Algorithmic content moderation involves advanced data science and machine learning—which trains on large datasets, learns from our online behavior, and becomes autonomous. By analyzing user behavior (input), platforms can gauge and personalize what content users see in their feeds (output). A person’s individual social media newsfeed is the result of algorithmic ranking, screening, and recommendations. For example, if a user watches a cat video on YouTube,&hellip;",

One of these conversations included a stop in Pittsburgh, PA to hear how competitiveness is defined and supported in the region, from local infrastructure to workforce preparedness. Why Pittsburgh? “The history of industrial and material innovation exists to allow rebuild, but we must mobilize around a shared vision for the future.” – Roundtable participant Industry growth and innovation have always been at the heart of Pittsburgh’s regional competitiveness. Several top companies and industries like the Kraft Heinz Company and U.S. Steel, as well as a dynamic energy production sector remain integral to its success. Historically known as the “Steel City,” Pittsburgh’s growing industry diversity—including life sciences, health care, business services, robotics, climate technology, and manufacturing—help drive its regional talent and economic activity today. Moreover, research initiatives driven by world-renowned local universities like Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh are shaping the region’s future as a technology incubator. As a result, top firms are flocking to the area to open new campuses, distribution centers, and more. Pittsburgh is, however, notoriously home to an older workforce: Employment recovery from the pandemic is in the bottom-fifth among the nation’s approximately 400 metropolitan statistical areas, implying that prime age workers have left the region for jobs elsewhere. Over the past year though job gains across the professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and education and health services sectors indicate positive signs that intentional investment in a resilient workforce and innovative initiatives will continue to drive regional competitiveness. All Policy is Local “Equity must be baked into the federal grantmaking process.” – Roundtable participant  In 2022, the Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Collaborative was one of 21 finalists awarded a nearly $63 million federal Build Back Better Regional Challenge (BBBRC) grant by the U.S. Economic Development Administration to transform local economies and enhance U.S. competitiveness. The grant presents the region with a dynamic opportunity to unite incubators and innovators across its robotics and autonomy technology sector— ensuring that all have a seat at the table, not just those who can afford to apply. Roundtable participants emphasized this aspect, saying that work should be centered around uplifting underrepresented businesses to reinforce the need for inclusive ecosystems, which will in turn drive regional competitiveness. While funding from BBBRC is crucial to jumpstarting innovation and growth, participants noted that overly prescriptive grant metrics can unintentionally hinder program success. Supply chain corridors span beyond Allegheny County—from Dauphin to Butler and Venango counties, for example—to connect businesses throughout the state. Grants and funding streams, however, can limit the scope of use, essentially cutting off crucial service connections that constrain the ability to collaborate and innovate. For instance, participants shared that grants might only include five of six relevant counties, meaning that someone is cut off from the chain entirely, which can hurt all businesses involved.

The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. You can read the first six blogs in our series on congressional support for reauthorization here, here, here, here, here, and here. Days before the Small Business Administration marked its 70th anniversary, lawmakers cleared a big hurdle on the road to reauthorizing SBA when the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee approved a legislative response to recently enacted SBA lending rules. Just as importantly, and in keeping with longstanding bipartisan support for small businesses, Republicans and Democrats worked together to craft legislation that both sides could support. Congress Pushes Back on SBA Rules Last year, SBA proposed several significant changes to its lending support programs that raised concerns from members of both parties on Capitol Hill. Significantly, the proposed rules, which were finalized in April, removed the moratorium on issuing new Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) licenses, created a new Community Advantage SBLC designation, and eliminated some of the criteria lenders use to evaluate small business borrowers. After the rules were finalized, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), ranking member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, called for a “legislative response” to the rules before discussing other aspects of SBA modernization. That response came on July 19 in a Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee markup. With an 18-1 vote, the committee pushed back on SBA’s changes and cleared the way for SBA reauthorization to progress anew. Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-MD) called the actions “historic” and said they “reflect the bipartisan spirit of our committee and our goal to remain laser-focused on codifying, modernizing and streamlining SBA programs.” Select Committee-Approved Changes to SBA Rules Small Business Lending Companies Allows for SBA to issue up to three new SBLC licenses, capping licenses at no more than 17 Allows SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Management to revoke SBLC licenses of borrowers that make too many risky loans or for predatory lending Community Advantage Makes the Community Advantage program permanent and undoes the Community Advantage SBLC designation Expands the Community Advantage loan guarantee to as much as $750,000 for newly designated “experienced” Community Advantage lenders Lending Criteria Reinstates many of the factors that lenders must consider when making SBA-guaranteed loans  Committee Advances Multiple Reforms In addition to the SBLC, Community Advantage, and lending rules changes, the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee approved bill also seeks to expand access to child care, help small businesses hire graduates from career and technical training programs, and speed up the commercialization of technologies developed in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.

    "content": "When Congress returns from its August recess, only several months will remain to enact major legislation before the start of a busy 2024 election season. Members of both parties recently introduced major tax policy legislation, but so far most of these bills remain partisan. If an opportunity for Congress to pass year-end tax legislation materializes, it will need to be the product of bipartisan compromise. Any tax policy legislation should also adhere to core values of: fostering domestic economic growth; providing support for workers and their families; and prioritizing fiscal responsibility. Domestic Economic Growth House Republicans recently introduced a package of three tax reform bills, collectively referred to as the American Families and Jobs Act, which were each reported out on a party-line vote from the Committee on Ways and Means. The first bill in the package, the Small Business Jobs Act, focuses on tax provisions affecting small businesses. The bill would increase an expensing allowance targeted at small businesses and make more investments in small businesses eligible for a tax exclusion. The second bill, the Build It in America Act, temporarily addresses three business tax provisions affected by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) by: Restoring full expensing for R&amp;D expenditures: Full expensing reduces the costs businesses bear when investing in R&amp;D. Until 2022, businesses had been able to fully recover the cost of their R&amp;D investments immediately. TCJA permanently switched R&amp;D treatment from full expensing to five-year amortization starting in 2022, which was projected to raise revenue and offset some of the cost of TCJA’s tax cuts. This provision would make full expensing retroactive to 2022 and extend it through 2025. Extending 100% bonus depreciation: TCJA provided businesses with an incentive to invest in assets that can make workers more productive, such as machinery and equipment, by offering 100% bonus depreciation (full and immediate expensing) in the year of the investment. TCJA scheduled this bonus depreciation to phase down 20 percentage points each year from 2023 through 2027. This provision would undo the phase-down through 2025. Restoring more generous allowances for interest deductions: TCJA reformed the deductibility of business interest, with a tightening of limits made effective in 2022. From 2018 through 2021, businesses could take interest deductions up to 30% of income based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Since 2022, the limit has been 30% of income based on earnings before just interest and taxes, reducing the value of interest deductions for companies making investments in depreciable or amortizable assets. This provision would restore the more generous limit through 2025. Worker and Family Supports The third bill in the Republicans’ tax package includes a major tax cut aimed at low- and middle-income workers and their families: a temporary increase to the standard deduction. The Tax Cuts for Working Families Act would expand the federal standard deduction on a temporary basis, for 2024 and 2025 only. The current standard deduction, $13,850 for single filers and $27,700 for married taxpayers filing jointly in tax year&hellip;",

Meanwhile, respondents to a recent, nationally representative BPC poll have noticed an increase in the level of homelessness in their local communities in the last year—especially in cities. The issue of homelessness is increasingly garnering national attention, with policymakers lamenting that there seems to be no end in sight to the crisis. However, local organizations in many cities are working to rise to the challenge, implementing new approaches and collaborating with city, state, and federal agencies to meet the needs of unhoused people. This mix of successful interventions and innovative new programs holds lessons for policymakers and stakeholders at all levels of government as they work to promote housing stability and address the crisis of homelessness in the United States.

    "content": "Debt limit brinkmanship has become a recurring pastime for Congress. Until lawmakers reform the process, however, the United States will keep accruing debt and inevitably hit the debt limit again and again, carrying with it the risk of delaying critical payments to American households and businesses, or potentially even defaulting on the national debt. By reforming the debt limit and avoiding the repeated flirtation with disaster, we can steer clear of the 10 devastating consequences outlined below: 1. Inflicting Widespread Short-Term Economic Pain Any delay in government payments or a default could lead to an economic slowdown at best, or a prolonged recession at worst. The Federal Reserve projected in 2013 that a one-month delay in payment obligations would have caused real growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by more than a percentage point. In 2023, this would equate to hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic activity. 2. Burdening American Households and Businesses with Higher Interest Rates America’s sovereign credit rating could witness further downgrades, resulting in  high interest rates throughout the economy, from mortgages to small business loans to interest payments on credit card balances and car payments—meaning month-to-month expenses could skyrocket for hardworking Americans. For example, at the current average and for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage ($423,500 and 7.38%, respectively), a 0.5 percentage point increase in mortgage rates would lead to $1,752 in increased annual payments for homeowners. 3. Increasing Costs to Taxpayers When investors start to lose confidence, interest rates rise on U.S. Treasury securities—increasing the government’s borrowing costs and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. In 2023, a permanent 0.5 percentage point rise in interest rates could have increased net interest costs by nearly $1.5 trillion over 10 years ($6,882 per taxpayer), worsening our unsustainable debt trajectory. 4. Delaying Critical Benefits That Millions Rely On Delayed payments could affect programs that touch nearly every American, from Social Security to military salaries and veterans’ benefits. For example, the 67 million Americans who receive, on average, $1,700 per month in Social Security benefits may have seen their checks delayed. A debt limit disaster would jeopardize the pay and benefits of more than 1.4 million active duty military servicemembers. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which help over 40 million Americans afford groceries each month, could be interrupted as well. The number of missed checks would grow rapidly as the impasse dragged on, causing widespread confusion and income shocks for households and business owners who rely on these programs. 5. Hurting Investors and Savers Major stock indices could nosedive, hurting Americans saving for retirement, for their children’s education, or for any number of personal savings goals or major expenses. Ahead of the 2011 debt limit episode—one without a default or missed payments—the S&amp;P 500 lost 17% of its value and took more than six months to return to its pre-impasse peak. A stock market downturn from an actual default would likely be much deeper and longer. 6. Delaying Tax Refunds Taxpayers and small businesses owed money by the&hellip;",

    "content": "Apprenticeships may be the fastest growing child care workforce development strategy in the United States. In the past three years, the number of states starting and expanding child care apprenticeship programs has doubled. Growth in Child Care and Early Learning Apprenticeships West Virginia has the longest running child care registered apprenticeship program in the nation, now into its third decade. For years there were apprenticeships for the child care workforce in only a handful of states, including California, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. But by 2018, child care apprenticeships had grown in more than a dozen states, including Colorado, Montana, and Virginia. Since 2020, interest and growth has led to 35 states with active regional or statewide child care registered apprenticeships. An additional seven states are developing programs this year. BPC’s upcoming child care apprenticeship report details funding strategies and state examples so states can learn from each other. Rapid growth in child care apprenticeship programs is exciting, but key challenges make launching and sustaining a program difficult: Programs are typically small start-ups. Sponsors lack the resources required to establish an apprenticeship program. Child care businesses operate on small margins and lack funds to offer the required pay increases. There is no coordinated plan for investment and support for registered apprenticeship programs. Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is an underutilized vehicle that could help grow apprentice opportunities for the child care workforce. WIOA passed with broad bipartisan support in 2014 and formalized the use of career pathways. States develop WIOA State Plans, as well as local and regional sub-plans that are responsive to their unique community needs. Workforce Development Boards at the state and local level enact the plans. To match employers with skilled workers and to help job seekers access employment, education, and training, WIOA strengthened registered apprenticeship programs. All registered apprenticeships are eligible for federal workforce funding from WIOA. The funding is allotted to states based on a formula, usually administered through local Workforce Development Boards. Local Workforce Development Boards can use funds to help support: On-the-job learning, also referred to as on-the-job training Related training and instruction Books, transportation, and resources, such as child care, that enable individuals to successfully participate in apprenticeship programs Growing Apprenticeships Grows Child Care Supply The nation’s success in meeting the need for child care depends on our ability to recruit and retain a competent workforce. Over the past 10 years the child care workforce has decreased significantly from more than 2 million to about 1.6 million child care teachers, program administrators, and family child care providers. High turnover impacts program stability, working families, and young children. Despite the value child care teachers generate for working families, employers, and communities, their wages are among the lowest of any occupation. The child care workforce is near the bottom percentile of all occupations when ranked by annual earnings; 98 percent of occupations have higher average annual earnings. Child care and early learning professionals need opportunities to increase their competencies, and most program staff cannot afford&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 4th, Louisiana-based U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty issued an order broadly limiting executive branch communications with social media companies. The lawsuit alleges that the administration “censored free speech by using threats of regulatory action or protection while pressuring companies to remove what it deemed misinformation. COVID-19 vaccines, legal issues involving President Joe Biden’s son Hunter and election fraud allegations were among the topics spotlighted in the lawsuit.” A federal appeals court temporarily paused the order as proceedings continue. The order only applies to named federal officials and agencies, but as the 2024 presidential election campaign season gets underway it is likely to have a chilling effect on election administrators&#8217; ability to work with partners to monitor and elevate authoritative election information. The order risks fueling a culture in which government contact with social media companies is seen as inherently risky in a predatory legal environment and curbing collaborative, cross-sector efforts to promote accurate election information.  While the potential implications from the case are real, this order does not spell the end of authoritative election information efforts. First, the order is a temporary injunction and the case still has a long process of working its way through the courts. Moreover, social media platforms will continue to monitor content in accordance with their own rules and policies. Platforms can still direct users to election information and election officials can still use social media to reach voters.  Legal Risks Disincentivize Collaboration If upheld, the order will limit the federal government’s ability to contact social media companies with the intent of “encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech.” Criminal activities are excluded from the order. Legitimate issues around free speech have been raised in the case, but the order has been criticized as having “broad scope and ambiguous terms” and leaves administration officials unsure of which actions fall under the sweeping mandate.  Uncertainty, especially paired with the risk of litigation, disincentivizes any collaboration with social media platforms &#8212; just as U.S. officials prepare for a high-turnout presidential election next year. 2024 will also be the first presidential election since the proliferation of widely accessible generative AI technologies, creating new risks for the spread of inaccurate election information. Mitigating those risks will require public-private partnerships between sources of authoritative election information (local election officials and federal security representatives) and the platforms responsible for moderating potentially erroneous content. While this court order is limited to the federal government, many state and local election officials worry they could be next. Election officials are increasingly subject to state laws penalizing minor administrative mistakes and are regularly subject to extensive litigation, taking limited resources away from administering elections and instead tying officials up producing documents and defending themselves in court. Local election officials serving on our Task Force on Elections say they know best what information within their communities might be inaccurate or misleading to voters.

    "content": "In global competition for labor and capital, tax law is one of the most-used tools by all countries. Some policymakers argue that decades of global tax competition aimed at attracting business investment have amounted to a “race to the bottom on corporate taxation.” These concerns have driven nearly 140 countries, led by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Group of 20 (G20) countries, to negotiate a two-part global tax agreement aimed at establishing rules for the taxation of digital goods and services in a 21st-century economy (“Pillar One”) and setting a minimum rate of corporate taxation (“Pillar Two”). The Biden administration negotiated an October 2021 agreement on behalf of the United States, but implementation has stalled due to political disagreements in Congress. The U.S. would need to pass legislation to implement Pillar Two, and may need to pass legislation to implement Pillar One too. Republicans have expressed deep concerns with the agreement as negotiated and want to stop it. Democrats, meanwhile, have proposed raising significant new revenue through the agreement by increasing taxes on business income earned abroad by U.S.-based companies. Each approach carries risks to U.S. competitiveness, while the agreement writ large carries a risk to economic growth: Double Taxation Risk: While some Republicans want to stop the global agreement in its track, failure to implement the agreement while other countries move forward could lead to double taxation of U.S. multinational companies, harming those companies and their workers. Revenue Maximizing Risk: Attempting to maximize revenue through taxation of business income earned abroad, as the Biden administration has proposed, could also hurt U.S. companies and workers by making the U.S. a less competitive location for businesses to invest in workers, tangible assets like factories and equipment, and research and development. Economic Growth Risk: It is important to note that only people can bear the burden of a tax. Corporations pass along any tax liability to people in the form of higher prices, lower wages, reduced return to capital (lower stock prices and dividend payments), or some combination of the three. Unfortunately, tax policy debates often fail to recognize this key point. Summary of the Global Tax Agreement The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework announced the outline of the two-pillar agreement in October 2021 includes the following provisions. Pillar One Pillar Two Goals -Reform taxation of global business income to account for the new digital economy -End countries’ imposition of unilateral digital services taxes (DSTs) on major tech companies -Push countries to set a minimum corporate income tax rate -Address “race to the bottom” on global tax competition Taxpayers Affected -Multinational companies with €20 billion or more in annual revenue and profitability above 10% of revenues -Primarily aimed at global tech companies Multinational companies with €750 million or more in annual revenue Tax Base -Residual profit: financial statement (i.e., book) income, after exempting profits equal to 10% of revenues -Transfer pricing issues related to companies’ marketing and distribution activities in any variety of countries are to be addressed through the development&hellip;",

Monterey Bay begins at Santa Cruz and is home to an astonishing array of marine life including fish, mammals, and sea birds. Here, for two days Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) welcomed his Ways &amp; Means Committee colleague, Blake Moore (R-UT). Rep. Panetta became the American Congressional Exchange’s first “repeat customer,” having previously paired with Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY). In the 1960s, Etta James sang that she wanted “some security.” That could have been the theme song for this ACE trip, it focused heavily on national, environmental, and food security. We kicked off the first day learning of the vital work at the Naval Postgraduate School, where the watchwords were excellence and innovation. Rep. Panetta was of course very familiar with NPS and Rep. Moore, who has Hill Air Force Base in his district, learned how the school is harnessing interdisciplinary student teams and commercial industry partners to solve for the myriad defense challenges of today and tomorrow. In that vein, the next stop featured a visit to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey.  The DLI lies within the Presidio of Monterey, an active military installation, first established by Spanish explorers and soldiers in the late 1700s. Rep. Panetta is on the Armed Services Committee and has a strong appreciation for providing our military with culturally based foreign language training to better understand the operational environment and maintain a competitive edge while safeguarding our national security. Moore became fluent in Korean while serving on a mission in Korea for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His career includes service in Southern Asia, including several years in the CIA. The DLI offers year-round foreign language instruction in more than two dozen languages to approximately 3,500 students.  The two members had a robust discussion (including a few remarks in Korean by Rep. Moore) and solidified their commitment to providing the resources necessary for language proficiency within the mission of the Department of Defense. Day two focused on the environmental security of our oceans, starting with a boat tour led by Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) Superintendent Lisa Woonick. Designated in 1992, the MBNMS is a federally protected marine area off of California&#8217;s central coast. The sanctuary encompasses a shoreline length of 276 miles and 6,094 square miles of ocean, extending an average distance of 30 miles from shore. At its deepest point, MBNMS reaches 12,743 feet (more than two miles). The sanctuary contains extensive kelp forests and has one of North America&#8217;s largest underwater canyons and closest-to-shore deep ocean environments. The two members learned about the diverse marine ecosystem and some of the incredible variety of marine life. Known as the &#8220;Serengeti of the Sea,&#8221; this remarkably productive marine environment is fringed by spectacular coastal scenery, including sand dunes, rocky cliffs, rolling hills and steep mountains.

    "content": "In 2021 and 2022, the 117th Congress authorized roughly $80 billion in federal spending targeted towards specific locations, also known as “place-based” spending. Of particular note is the creation of at least 20 geographically distributed regional technology and innovation hubs as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The success of these investments depends on many factors, one of the most important being the availability of skilled workers. Yet the United States faces a labor shortage problem exacerbated by an aging population. For many years, the Bipartisan Policy Center has examined the role of immigrants in the U.S. economy and where bipartisan agreement is possible on reforming immigration policy. With the opportunity presented by the massive federal financial infusion of the CHIPS and Science Act, and likely shortages in the availability of workers to make that spending productive, an increase in place-based, high-skilled immigration stands to boost U.S. regional growth and international competitiveness. Lessons from Silicon Valley The recent case of Silicon Valley’s development demonstrates the importance of immigration, and particularly high-skilled immigration, in driving the success of a thriving technology and innovation center. Research from the early 2000s noted that more than a quarter of Silicon Valley’s highly skilled workers were immigrants, with skilled immigrants accounting for one-third of the region’s engineering workforce. In 1998, Chinese and Indian engineers were senior executives at one-quarter of Silicon Valley’s technology businesses. These immigrant-run companies collectively accounted for more than $26.8 billion in sales and 58,282 jobs. Importantly, foreign-born scientists and engineers were starting new businesses faster than native counterparts from 1995 to 2005, with just over half of the new start-ups in Silicon Valley founded by immigrants during this time period. This persisted in subsequent years and across the country: from 2010-2019, foreign-born workers accounted for up to three-quarters of the growth in businesses across 248 metro areas. These new businesses have benefited the native population by creating jobs for them, boosting business dynamism, and driving economic growth. Indeed evidence suggests that an increase in the immigrant share of the population leads to a proportionally greater increase in job creation across the board. The lesson is that embracing foreign talent and tapping into their entrepreneurship can help drive the success of new regional technology and innovation hubs across the country, whether they be in the U.S. heartland, the Southeast, or elsewhere.  The Vital Role of Immigration  While many factors made Silicon Valley a success, immigration was a key ingredient. Today, in the face of chronic labor shortages, immigration is vital to keeping the U.S. competitive and ensuring that the federal government’s latest investments are used productively. Indeed, a 2021 survey of technology executives found that a majority raised labor shortages as their top concern, ranking it higher than supply chain issues and cybersecurity threats. Without action, we can expect labor shortages to worsen, both as the demand for digital skills continues to grow and the supply of labor falls as the U.S. population ages.

    "content": "Parents and guardians of minor children (“parents” throughout this blog) are eligible for several family and income supports through the tax code.1 The Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult recently polled parents to better understand their experiences during the 2023 tax season and measure awareness of and claiming behaviors tied to the Child Tax Credit. Our findings build on our previous analysis of parents’ perception of and interaction with claiming the CTC, particularly following the expiration of its pandemic-era expansion enacted through the American Rescue Act of 2021. Accessing the Child Tax Credit As Figure 1 demonstrates, nearly all parents (92%) polled said that they are somewhat or very familiar with the CTC. This familiarity was also high in 2022 (87%), possibly due to the increased attention given to the credit following its temporary expansion in 2021. Those changes included an increase to the credit amount, expanded eligibility, and the option to claim part of it before filing their taxes through advanced monthly payments. Figure 1: How familiar are you, if at all, with the Child Tax Credit? Note: Numbers may not add to 100% due to rounding. “Income” refers to household income. The majority of parents (78%) said they claimed the CTC on their most recent tax return, as shown in Figure 2, possibly due to the heightened awareness and increased publicity of the credit over the past few years. When also considering respondents who said their child was claimed by another taxpayer, rates were even higher: 85% (+7 percentage points) in 2022, further demonstrating that parents are accessing this credit at high rates. Figure 2: Did you claim the Child Tax Credit on your most recent tax return? Note: Numbers may not add to 100% due to rounding. “Income” refers to household income. Only 10% of parents said they were ineligible to claim the CTC in 2023. Due to the CTC’s phase-in rules, it is likely that more of those near the bottom of the income distribution did not qualify for the credit compared to last year. The 2021 changes temporarily expanded eligibility by eliminating the earned-income phase-in; the expiration of that provision may mean fewer low-income parents were eligible on their most recent return. Claiming Complexity Among parents who claimed the CTC on their most recent tax return, the majority (85%) said it was simple to do so, as detailed in Figure 3. Figure 3: How simple or complicated was it to claim the Child Tax Credit (CTC)? Note: Numbers may not add to 100% due to rounding. “Income” refers to household income. Some taxpayers, however, did report confusion over eligibility requirements and other complications. Among the 13% of parents who said the CTC was complicated to claim, they said that tax filing took too long to complete (50%), were confused over eligibility (26%), were concerned about being audited (21%), or did not understand IRS forms (17%). Anecdotally, high-income parents were more likely than their low-income counterparts to say that the tax filing process took too long&hellip;",

    "content": "Which factors influence the risks and benefits of using face recognition technologies? Diverse stakeholders from industry, academia, civil society, and government agencies acknowledge that face recognition technologies’ benefits and risks vary depending on accuracy, broader performance, functional application, use case, and other factors. Most, if not all, of the benefits and risks that face recognition technologies produce are sociotechnical, “meaning they are influenced by societal dynamics and human behavior.” The National Institute of Standards and Technology explains that sociotechnical risks and benefits “can emerge from the interplay of technical aspects” and “societal factors,” including the context in which users deploy the system. The impacts of this interplay can be challenging to understand and especially difficult to quantify. Perspectives on face recognition technologies’ risks and benefits may differ depending on whether one considers risks and benefits in absolute terms or relative to alternatives. Such alternatives may include using technologies that leverage other biometric modalities or having people manually perform tasks that face recognition technologies can fully or partially automate. This fourth (and final) piece in the ongoing series about face recognition technology governance challenges describes how accuracy, broader performance, functional application, and use case impact the sociotechnical benefits and risks that face recognition technologies can produce. The piece also highlights several of face recognition technologies’ data security risks and benefits across accuracy levels, functional applications, and use cases. Rather than recommending whether or when to use the technologies, this piece explains how different factors impact the technologies’ risks and benefits. In doing so, this piece aims to help policymakers and other stakeholders develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of key issues and facilitate more productive dialogue about legislative and other governance frameworks. Relationship Between Accuracy, Benefits, and Risks As the previous piece in this series explained, face recognition technologies produce three main types of errors: failures to enroll, false positives, and false negatives. Failure to enroll errors occur when face recognition technologies are unable to generate a face template and therefore cannot perform their verification or identification functions. False positive errors occur when the face recognition technology incorrectly indicates that images of two different individuals show the same person. False negative errors occur when the face recognition technology incorrectly indicates that two images of the same person show different people. There are technical trade-offs between false positive and false negative error rates. Calibrating “thresholds” to deal with these trade-offs is “a delicate balancing act” that varies “based on many factors including use case.” Each type of error can produce negative consequences, but the severity depends on the functional application and use case, which is why different thresholds may be appropriate for different functional applications and use cases. A false positive error that erroneously identifies an individual as someone on a watch list or a false negative error that erroneously fails to identify an individual as a member of a trusted group could impede an authorized individual’s access to a device or location. Depending on the device or location and the&hellip;",

    "content": "The American Congressional Exchange headed for the heart of the South last week for the very first back-to-back ACE trips. Each was a bustling district that showcased the history, challenges, and enormous promise of a region critical to America’s future. This was a two-day whirlwind between Atlanta, GA, and Greenville-Spartanburg, SC, that truly showcased the South’s dynamism, beginning at the busiest (and, as they say, most efficient) airport in the world, and ended at an inland port packed with trucks and trains moving goods to and from the booming Upstate South Carolina region. Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport is not just the hub of travel in the South, but also a key connection point for the nation’s economy as well as travelers from around the world. Efficiency is critical, and in particular airport officials were keen to showcase a new perimeter taxiway that bypasses the need for planes to cross busy runways made possible, in part, by federal funding.  Officials from Delta Air Lines also joined the tour, as Atlanta is their major hub and headquarters. Delta showcased its growing fleet of electric ground support equipment, moving the airline away from fossil fuels for key operations like transporting and loading baggage. The theme shifted to more local commerce and a focus on minority entrepreneurship with a working lunch with Atlanta Black small business owners and representatives from Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs and The Entrepreneurship Center of the Urban League of Greater Atlanta. Concerns were raised concerning workforce shortages – a common theme on most ACE trips – the challenging business environment linked to high interest rates, the opportunity for FinTech to help small businesses, and potential growth in cybersecurity careers. The subsequent tour of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, as well as Dr. King’s birth home, were highlights of the trip and brought into profound focus Atlanta’s seminal role in the Civil Rights movement. Representative Williams of course had visited before, but for Rep. Timmons this was a firsthand opportunity to learn more about Dr. King’s legacy and the continuing struggle for equality. In addition to preserving this important history, the center actively educates and trains individuals in how to lead their communities in the spirit of his approach, such as through its Nonviolence 365 training. From there, the two members were afforded a glimpse into the cutting-edge technologies that the Georgia Tech Strategic Energy Institute is developing to accelerate the path to carbon-neutral energy solutions. As a capstone to the day, before Reps. Timmons and Williams departed for South Carolina, they shared dinner with representatives from Atlanta-area Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  The conversation covered a wide range of issues, including the unique experience students enjoy at HBCUs, how education can close the racial wealth gap, and the importance of companies partnering with HBCUs to get students into job pipelines. The following morning started early in downtown Greenville, SC, which has undergone extensive rejuvenation in recent years.

    "content": "Today, the Supreme Court overturned President Biden’s plan to forgive more than $400 billion in student debt, reaffirming the important principle that major fiscal policy changes should be made by the legislative branch. The Supreme Court’s decision will undoubtedly disappoint many borrowers who had hoped this policy would provide immediate debt relief. It should also renew lawmakers’ commitment to finding comprehensive solutions to the rising cost of college and the resulting debt. The court’s ruling underscores the need for bipartisan legislation that provides targeted relief to students struggling to repay their loans and protects taxpayers and borrowers from the consequences of excessive student debt by addressing the underlying forces driving the problem. In today’s dollars, federal student loan debt expanded from $750 billion in 2007 to $1.6 trillion in 2023. During this time, the number of loan recipients increased from 28 million to 44 million people. This expansion in outstanding federal student debt creates risks for both borrowers and taxpayers alike. It also poses significant concerns for racial equity and social mobility—low-income and Black students are more likely than their peers both to borrow for higher education and to default on their loans. Indeed, prior to the pandemic and the associated repayment pause, nearly two out of five federally managed loans were either delinquent or in default. Yet, while the debate over student debt forgiveness captures public attention, the growth in student debt is the product of deeper problems rooted in the declining affordability of higher education. Several factors, among others, contribute to these rising costs and the resulting increases in student debt: Declining public investment in state systems of higher education. As a share of personal income, states’ support for higher education dropped from 1.0% in the mid-1970s to 0.5% in 2019. Public systems of higher education have responded to declining state support by increasing their reliance on tuition dollars. Erosion in the value of Pell Grants. Pell grants have not kept up with increases in tuition or rising costs of attendance. Between the 1999-2000 and 2019-20 academic years, cost of attendance at public four-year institutions grew by 76% while the maximum Pell Grant grew by just 29%. Availability of federal loans. Although the magnitude of the impact is debated, the availability of federal loans puts upward pressure on tuition prices, while giving institutions of higher education little incentive to control costs. Debt cancellation would have done nothing to address these drivers. It is, moreover, an inefficient and regressive approach to the challenge of student debt that does not distinguish between borrowers who are struggling to repay loans and those with higher-paying jobs that will allow them to more easily repay their obligations. Meanwhile, too many students leave higher education without completing a degree or certificate, while others graduate with a credential that provides limited or no value. For these students, even comparatively small amounts of student debt can present a tremendous burden. Addressing these interrelated issues requires a comprehensive solution that combines front-end affordability investments for students with&hellip;",

Crane made his priorities clear—get clean energy technologies deployed and deployed quickly. Recent landmark legislation has placed DOE at the forefront of the energy transition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests billions of dollars to revamp the nation&#8217;s energy systems and finance the development of renewable energy and emissions-reduction technologies. The CHIPS and Science Act makes historic investments in the nation’s research and development infrastructure to develop innovative energy technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act includes $370 billion to deploy clean energy solutions in every sector of the economy and every corner of the country. With resources in hand, Crane now oversees the DOE’s effort to stand up new programs and shift the agency’s focus to commercializing technologies capable of meeting America’s energy needs and achieving emissions reduction goals. In his new position, Crane oversees the new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Loan Programs Office, and other DOE offices critical to the deployment of clean energy infrastructure that will improve access to reliable energy sources across the nation. He also brings a unique perspective to the position due to his private sector experience as CEO of NRG Energy and expressed his hopes of shifting energy progress from &#8220;private sector-led and government-enabled&#8221; to &#8220;government-enabled and government-accelerated.&#8221; With hundreds of billions of dollars at his disposal, Crane intends to match the private sector pace for energy innovation, pressure hard-to-abate sectors to reduce their emissions, and provide demand-side support and government procurement options for promising technologies. Still, he acknowledges the uncertainties of scaling up clean energy prototypes, remarking, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to be prepared to try some things&#8221; and &#8220;if nothing we ever do fails, then we didn&#8217;t take enough chances.&#8221; Crane&#8217;s vision for energy innovation also implies a new role for the private sector. To speak on the future of the energy industry, BPC also hosted a panel discussion led by Tanya Das, BPC Senior Associate Director for Energy Innovation, with Norm Augustine, Chad Holliday—co-chairs of BPC’s American Energy Innovation Council—and Tom Steyer, co-executive chair of Galvanize Climate Solutions, a leading voice in the conversation about clean energy and climate. The panel closed with Augustine, Holliday, and Steyer, all who have held comparable leadership positions, providing the Under Secretary with advice about how to be successful in his position.",

    "content": "In January 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed a rule that would “ban employers from imposing noncompetes on their workers.” Business groups raised immediate concerns and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce threatened to sue the FTC. Objections ranged from abrogation of state law to the proposed rule’s broad scope, with critics also arguing that noncompete agreements are needed to protect research and development, workforce training, and trade secrets. From another perspective, however, strict enforcement of noncompetes can sideline entrepreneurs and gum up the free flow of ideas and talent that spawn the development of robust regional economies and innovation ecosystems. That could undermine U.S. competitiveness at a time when the federal government is allocating billions of dollars to enhance competitiveness at the regional level. Mechanics and Politics of Noncompetes Noncompetes, or noncompete agreements (formally, covenants not to compete), are contractual employment terms that restrict an employee from leaving a job to work for a competitor or start a competing business. The terms typically apply within a certain geographic area and are time limited. Historically, noncompete agreements have been a state law issue, and states have long varied in how strictly they will enforce a noncompete agreement. Most famously, noncompetes have been unenforceable in California since the 19th century. Other states have strict enforcement regimes: In the 1980s and 1990s, academics pointed to California’s approach as a key reason why the state (especially Silicon Valley) had pulled ahead of others such as Massachusetts and New Jersey in the creation of new high-technology firms, products, and services. Despite objections from some business groups, the idea of federally mandated restrictions on noncompete agreements has had bipartisan support for several years. In 2019, Senators Todd Young (R-IN) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) introduced the Workforce Mobility Act (WMA) to limit the use of noncompete agreements. (The House introduced a complementary version as well.) The bipartisan WMA was reintroduced in both chambers in 2021 and again this February in the 118th Congress. In the last few years, several states (including Massachusetts) have reformed their regulatory regimes to relax enforcement or only permit noncompete agreements above certain income levels. Effects on Entrepreneurship In announcing its rule, the FTC placed primary emphasis on worker wages. It’s well-established that “job switchers,” people who move to a new job at a different company, tend to enjoy higher wage growth than “job stayers,” those who move to a new job at the same company. Restrictions on that mobility thus presumably suppress wage growth. A more interesting dimension of noncompete agreements and their enforcement pertains to entrepreneurship. In the published notice of proposed rulemaking, the FTC cites research findings that noncompete enforcement reduces new business formation, venture capital investment, and patenting: “New business formation increases competition first by bringing new ideas to market, and second, by forcing incumbent firms to respond to new firms’ ideas instead of stagnating. New businesses disproportionately create new jobs and are, as a group, more resilient to economic downturns.” Each of these claims has been established&hellip;",

    "content": "The U.S. tax code enables the federal government to collect nearly $5 trillion in revenue each year. Its structure creates incentives that influence the financial and economic decisions of individuals and companies from small to large. Those actions in turn shape the country’s relative global competitiveness. To enhance competitiveness, changes to the tax code must: Foster domestic economic growth; Provide support for workers and their families; Bring in revenue to meet the nation’s spending needs; and Be both administrable and equitable. These priorities are difficult to balance and indeed can clash. We evaluate each below in the broader context of global competition for U.S. workers and investments. Important considerations include tax rates and tax bases and the creation or reform of tax expenditures, provisions of the code such as credits, deductions, or exemptions that deviate from what experts consider a normal tax system and reduce tax liabilities. Growing the Domestic Economy As technology improves, business investment shifts toward easy-to-move but difficult-to-price intangible assets, and a significant proportion of Americans continue to work remotely, which alters how the tax code affects growth. Economic growth has slowed in the U.S. in recent decades and is projected to slow even further in the coming years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, U.S. annual real gross domestic product growth averaged: 4.4% per year from 1950-1969; 3.2% per year from 1970-1989; 2.6% per year from 1990-2009; and 2.1% per year from 2010-2022. Concerns about U.S. competitiveness and economic growth drove passage of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, which provided a 25% tax credit for domestic manufacturing of semiconductors critical to computers, cars, and energy infrastructure, among other incentives. Senators have begun work on follow-up legislation to invest “in domestic industries, including small businesses, that can reduce reliance on China” and increase U.S. competitiveness. Policymakers must square these kinds of supports—which often involve expanding business tax incentives to capture more private investment than economic allies or adversaries—with the need to address America’s sizable fiscal challenges. After all, persistent federal budget deficits and a ballooning federal debt also threaten U.S. competitiveness. Congress can support growth and make a dent in the deficit by reforming narrowly targeted tax incentives, splitting the savings between deficit reduction and an array of broad-based policies to support workers and businesses. Providing Support to Working Families The tax code also plays a critical role in providing financial support to American workers and their families, from the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to child care supports like the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) and tax-advantaged dependent care assistance programs (DCAPs) to incentives affecting child care access, housing supply and health care affordability.  These supports are critical to U.S. competitiveness: the spillover effects can create societal benefits beyond the households they serve, such as improving health and educational outcomes, incentivizing participation in the labor force, and even generating an increase in tax revenues over time to partially offset the tax credits’ cost. Such improvements to society can also contribute to&hellip;",

    "content": "Heider Garcia became the elections director in Tarrant County, Texas, in 2018. Garcia quickly became known for his unique approach to inviting election skeptics into process, giving them tours of election facilities, and engaging with their questions. In April 2023, though, Garcia—described as a prototype of an election administrator—submitted his resignation, saying he felt his commitment to “respect and zero politics” could not be maintained due to differences with a new county executive. Stories like Heider Garcia’s are far too common. A Brennan Center for Justice survey of local election officials conducted in March 2022 found that one in five local election officials plans to leave their role before 2024, citing efforts to undermine the election system, burnout, stress, and retirement plans. That means that at least 20% of election officials are expected to have no experience running a high-turnout presidential election in 2024. Policymakers should be doing what they can to stem the tide of turnover; it’s as important as ever to preserve as much of the election administration institutional knowledge we can. The work of administering an election is complex and demanding, and even small mistakes can spiral into crises of public trust. Many departing election administrators not only bring decades of experience to their work, but have accumulated critical professional relationships and built trust within their communities. These are hard-earned relationships that equip them to pick up the phone and get a quick response to difficult questions, averting problems before they arise. When seasoned election administrators leave their roles, their experience and that public trust goes with them. What’s worse? Some of this loss is preventable. Take Meagan Wolfe, the non-partisan administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) and the state’s chief election official. Unanimously appointed by the bipartisan, six-member WEC in February of 2018, Wolfe ensures that Wisconsin’s 1,922 local election officials (more than any other state in the country) have the resources and technology necessary to conduct elections. Wolfe started as Wisconsin’s voter outreach coordinator in 2011 and has served as an Election IT Project Manager, Deputy Administrator, and IT Director.  The WEC will be voting on her reappointment in the near future. Wolfe embodies the commitment to excellence and integrity that is the heart of our nation’s election administration. She served as president of the bipartisan National Association of State Election Directors and retains the respect and admiration of her Republican and Democratic peers across the country. Her multi-faceted experience makes her an invaluable asset to Wisconsin’s election officials as they prepare for a high-turnout, high-stakes 2024 presidential election. In a letter to Wisconsin clerks on June 14, 2023, she said, “while I would ultimately support the Commission’s decision to go in the direction of appointing someone new, there is no substitute for my decade-plus of experience in helping run Wisconsin elections at the state level. It is a fact that if I am not selected for this role, Wisconsin would have a less experienced administrator at the helm.”  When considering her reappointment next&hellip;",

    "content": "This blog is part of our “Road to Reauthorization” blog series, that builds off BPC’s latest small business report, Small Agency, Big Mandate: A Bipartisan Road Map to Modernizing SBA. The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. You can read the first five blogs in our series on congressional support for reauthorization here, here, here, here, and here. Americans have been starting new businesses at a record rate since 2020. Between 2005 and 2019, an average of 2.8 million new business applications were filed annually with the IRS. Between 2020 and 2022, that average rose to 4.9 million—a 78% increase. The latest Census Bureau data show the trend is continuing, with elevated levels of new business activity this year. As the primary source of U.S. job creation, this surge in entrepreneurship holds tremendous promise for U.S. economic growth and competitiveness. It also represents a wave of new “customers” for the Small Business Administration (SBA), whose Office of Entrepreneurial Development is charged with providing entrepreneurs and small business owners with education, training, and resources to help them start, grow, and succeed. The increase in new businesses poses important questions to policymakers, including about the effectiveness of taxpayer-funded entrepreneurial development programs and SBA’s capacity to meet the increased demand for its services. Congress has been exploring some of these questions, most recently during a House Small Business Committee hearing on June 13 that included discussion of SBA resource partners, including Small Business Development Centers and SCORE, along with the Community Navigator Pilot program. Policymakers and small businesses would benefit from additional exploration of how to best meet the education and training needs of entrepreneurs. Improving Entrepreneurial Assistance Via SCORE Across the rotunda, senators have proposed a number of reforms to SCORE, an SBA resource partner whose volunteers deliver counseling to small business owners throughout the country. In early June, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), ranking member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, introduced S. 1896, the SCORE Act, with Senator Todd Young (R-IN). The legislation incorporates several BPC recommendations, including shifting SCORE from a mentoring to coaching model, improving volunteers’ knowledge of digital tools available to small businesses, and diversifying its volunteer base to better reflect the diversity of current small business owners. The Republican-backed SCORE Act also seeks to increase the value of SCORE-provided guidance by establishing a coaching certification program and places an emphasis on serving rural small business owners, including through virtual and web-based initiatives. Another bill (S. 1744) focused on SCORE and backed by Democratic Senators Chris Coons (DE), Ben Cardin (MD), and Ed Markey (MA) also expands SCORE’s services to include greater online support for entrepreneurs. Additionally, the bill establishes accounting standards, institutes whistleblower protections, and mandates congressional reports. While the two bills emphasize different reforms, they share the goal of improving SCORE so that entrepreneurs and small business owners get the help they need. This shared objective may provide a starting point for bipartisan&hellip;",

    "content": "AI tools are already being used in the 2024 campaign, and American voters aren’t ready for it. AI-generated political commercials have aired. People have been fooled by fake images, videos, and audio made of the candidates. To understand where the campaign policies stand, BPC evaluated tools from some of the more prominent companies. We looked at their written policies and entered prompts to determine what the AI tools would generate. Companies deploying AI tools must consider the political use cases to come. They have more work to do in the next 18 months before the 2024 presidential election but can build upon the lessons they and others have learned. Before we dig in, this is a quickly evolving space. Some notes: At the beginning of May, when we first started looking into this, Google’s Bard was still in beta mode and not yet open to the public. On May 7, when entering the prompt, “Write a blog post about the importance of voting,” Bard showed an error message that said, “We’re still learning and can’t help with that. Try another request.” When we tried again at the end of May, it generated a post. OpenAI’s policies are already evolving. It is one of the only platforms that explicitly calls out politics in its rules, which are also vague. At the end of March, in response to a New York Times story about the use of AI in campaigns, the platform revised its policy to say that it could not be used to generate a “high volume” of campaign material. But “high volume” was not defined. Moreover, after inking a partnership with FiscalNote to use OpenAI’s plugins, OpenAI had to clarify with FiscalNote that the plugins couldn’t be used for political campaigning but “grassroots advocacy campaigns.” In April, when asked by the Washington Post, Meta declined to specify if politicians can post AI fakes without explicit warnings embedded in the media. We expect AI policies to continue to evolve and change as technology develops and elections take place in India, Indonesia, Ukraine, Taiwan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the European Parliament. As a starting point, below is an analysis by platform with tools offered, description of any policies specific to politics, a link to their policies, if they mention political, harmful, false content, and any impersonation clauses. A few specifically mention politics, but many do not. Bing’s AI image generator is the only one we found that blocked the creation of political content when the prompt said, “Generate a photo of the crowd supporting a political campaign.” However, it did not block creation when the prompt was, “Generate a photo of the crowd supporting Michael Michaelson.” Workarounds will likely be exploited.

    "content": "The newly enacted Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), which suspends the debt limit through January 1, 2025 and places caps on discretionary spending for the next two years, includes an enforcement provision designed to incentivize lawmakers to enact regular, full-year appropriations bills in a prudent manner. If Congress has not passed all 12 appropriations bills by January 1, 2024 (for Fiscal Year 2024), or January 1, 2025 (for FY2025), then automatic spending caps will take effect at levels 1% below what was enacted for FY2023 appropriations. Lawmakers would then have until April 30 to enact full-year appropriations before the 1% cuts are locked in for the remainder of the year. The inclusion of this enforcement mechanism could be an implicit acknowledgment by lawmakers that bipartisan agreement on spending levels will be difficult even with spending caps in place: some Democrats are concerned that non-defense discretionary spending is too low under the deal, some Republicans are frustrated that the FRA did not cut non-defense spending enough—and members of both parties are worried that defense spending is too low under the caps. In the past 47 years, Congress has passed all 12 appropriations bills before the start of the fiscal year (October 1) just four times. When a continuing resolution (CR) is needed to prevent a government shutdown, the average CR length over those 47 years has been 137 days per year—more than four months. The enforcement provision in the FRA should serve as an incentive for lawmakers to complete full-year appropriations within the first 90 days of the fiscal year because: The automatic 1% cut that takes effect on January 1, absent full-year appropriations, would significantly cut defense spending relative to the FRA’s caps—a result lawmakers in both parties will likely want to avoid. Enacting full-year appropriations could unlock a number of side agreements that could increase non-defense spending by at least $40 billion over the next two years—around $21 billion each year—a result many in Congress would likely be pleased with. In short, there are incentives for both Republicans and Democrats to reach a full-year appropriations deal before the 1% cuts from FY2023 levels take place on April 30 of each year. The following table compares what spending caps could look like under two scenarios versus the Congressional Budget Office’s pre-FRA baseline: Full-year appropriations passed between October 1 and April 30 of a fiscal year (i.e., at FRA cap levels); or A full-year continuing resolution (CR), or appropriations passed between May 1 and September 30 of a fiscal year (i.e., an automatic 1% cut from FY2023 levels): 248 Congress has yet to begin the process of passing discretionary appropriations bills for FY2024, and the final appropriations agreements will likely provide for spending (budget authority) above the levels outlined in the table above—both due to the aforementioned side agreements and emergency supplemental spending for both defense and non-defense, which is not subject to the caps. If the FRA induces Congress to pass all 12 appropriations bills before May 1 (or even January&hellip;",

    "content": "With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) well into its second year, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is working to launch remaining programs and projects authorized by the law. One such program is the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Infrastructure (ARPA-I). ARPA-I is a welcome addition to DOT’s research and development toolbox, with the potential to unleash transformative technological change in the transportation sector after years of underinvestment in this area. Modeled after DARPA in the Department of Defense and ARPA-E within the Department of Energy, ARPA-I was created to invest in technologies that will lower the long-term costs of transportation infrastructure development; reduce environmental impacts of infrastructure; contribute to the safe, secure, and efficient movement of goods and people; and promote resilience from physical and cyber threats, while positioning the U.S. as a global leader in advanced transportation technologies and materials. Despite its broad name, ARPA-I will only fund transportation-related projects and, unlike other recent initiatives at DOT, it will focus only on technology—not on policies, processes, or regulations. BPC has long supported the ARPA model for technology development and has recommended using it to spur innovation in other sectors such as water. The model brings several advantages, including the ability to invest in high-risk, high-reward research that might not otherwise proceed and flexibility in hiring and decision-making. By the tenth anniversary of ARPA-E, its projects had attracted $2.9 billion in private sector funding and created 76 new companies. DARPA, the agency on which both ARPA-E and ARPA-I were modeled, is credited with developing GPS and the Internet, among other things. As DOT launches ARPA-I, the agency has requested comments on what types of projects it should fund. Ideas are requested for &#8220;new and emerging areas of innovation, including external early-stage research and development” in five specific areas—safety, advanced construction materials and methods, digital infrastructure, freight and logistics optimization, and climate and resilience—as well as any other areas aligned with ARPA-I&#8217;s mission. DOT notes that it is already engaged in many types of R&amp;D through its existing programs, and commenters should explain how their ideas for ARPA-I would complement, but not duplicate, those efforts. Comments are due within 45 days. ARPA-I has thus far received only an initial appropriation of $3.2 million from Congress. If its predecessors are any guide, funding this agency will ultimately generate a significant return on investment as improvements in infrastructure delivery and efficiency are realized.",

Nearly half (46%) of adults said there has been an increase in the level of homelessness in their community over the past year, with 57% of urban respondents noting an increase. Over half of respondents (55%) said homelessness is a serious problem in their local community, while four in five (85%) viewed it as a serious problem nationally. Over half (58%) viewed it as a “very serious problem” nationally. High housing costs and the lack of affordable homes are perceived as major causes of homelessness. 74% of respondents said the lack of an adequate supply of affordable homes is a problem in the United States, while a similar share (75%) said inadequate housing supply contributes to high housing costs. 77% of respondents believe an inadequate supply of affordable homes contributes to homelessness in America, and 66% identify high housing costs as a major cause of homelessness. While a majority of Democrats (83%) and Republicans (69%) think that an inadequate supply of affordable homes contributes to homelessness in America, Democrats (53%) were more likely than Republicans (32%) to have said it “significantly contributes.” Adults also identified drug and alcohol use (69%), poverty (67%), and mental illness (63%) as major causes of homelessness. Most respondents believe homelessness should be a top priority for the federal government and want to see 2024 presidential candidates propose plans to significantly reduce homelessness. Four in five (82%) adults said it should be a priority for the federal government to help ensure that everyone has access to a safe and affordable place to live, with 90% of Democrats, 75% of Republicans, and 78% of independents in support. Just over half of respondents (53%) believe it should be a top priority. A plurality (31%) of adults sees the federal government as being most responsible for addressing homelessness—compared to 22% for state governments and 17% for local governments. Pluralities of polled Democrats (36%), Republicans (30%), and independents (26%) agree that the federal government is most responsible for addressing homelessness. More than four in five (82%) adults said it is an important priority for presidential candidates in the 2024 election to develop and advance a plan to significantly reduce homelessness. This is an important priority for adults who voted for Joe Biden (88%) in the last presidential election as well as for those who voted for Donald Trump (76%). A bipartisan majority would support congressional action to address homelessness by providing greater resources for support programs and enacting policies to expand the supply of affordable homes. The survey found a high level of bipartisan support for policies to expand federal assistance for veterans experiencing homelessness, homeless individuals with mental illness, and substance abuse recovery programs aimed at homeless individuals. Proposals to address the need for a greater supply of homes—such as expanding federal incentives for low-income housing development, incentivizing zoning reforms, and providing funding to preserve federally-subsidized housing—also saw high levels of bipartisan support.&hellip;",

    "content": "The 2023 tax filing season is drawing to a close and it was, by many accounts, the smoothest filing season—for both the IRS and taxpayers—since before the pandemic. With the IRS touting improved services throughout this filing season, now is a good time to take stock of taxpayers’ perspectives. A new poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult provides more details on the filing experience and how taxpayers are using their refunds in this uncertain economy. As of the end of April, IRS data showed service improvements from their perspective this tax season: By April 21, the IRS had processed 98.1% of total returns it had received, compared to just 90.6% for the same week in 2021. Through April 14, IRS customer representatives had provided an 85.4% level of service (one measure of how many taxpayers seeking help from an IRS employee are able to reach one) on its phone lines compared to just 16% through the same period in 2022. Also through April 14, the IRS reduced the average time to answer taxpayer calls from 28 minutes last year to just three minutes. Taxpayers received smaller refunds on average this filing season ($2,812) than last filing season ($3,033), potentially due in part to the expiration of pandemic-era expansions of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). From an administrative perspective, the end of these changes likely reduced confusion and filing complexity at tax time. Visits to the IRS website during tax season were 20% lower than in 2022 and 60% lower than in 2021. BPC and Morning Consult wanted to better understand how taxpayers felt they fared, polling 2,200 adults from April 25-28, 2023, on their filing experiences during the 2023 tax season and their current financial well-being, with key findings below. How Americans Filed At the time the poll was conducted, 80% of responding adults had filed their taxes for 2022 income. Figure 1 shows how these individuals filed their recent tax return, with more than a third (37%) using tax preparation software, while another 26% hired a paid tax preparer, 15% filled out IRS forms on their own, and 12% had a family or friend file their taxes. Figure 1: How did you file your most recent 2022 tax return? The IRS extended filing and payment deadlines for taxpayers in disaster areas, including most of the state of California, for the 2023 filing season. These extensions may explain a significant portion of the adults who reported not having filed their 2022 taxes in the BPC-Morning Consult poll. Poll respondents also expressed concerns about tax code complexity and compliance burdens when filing. BPC has raised similar concerns, generally agreeing that solutions to improve system automation, strengthen data-sharing practices, and mitigate filing errors from the start would enhance the taxpayer experience. Respondents were asked how the IRS could ease the filing process. Some argued that nothing needs improvement, while many had suggestions to enhance the current system’s data processing capabilities, increase efficiency to&hellip;",

    "content": "Apple&#8217;s introduction of the “Vision Pro” headset this week is a major moment for XR and is reopening discussions surrounding immersive technologies’ impact on society and public policy’s role. BPC launched an XR Initiative to study immersive technologies and help inform policymakers about these emerging technologies in 2021. BPC’s “Thinking Ahead about XR,” is the result of a series of convenings to gain diverse perspectives from civil society, academia, industry, and other stakeholders on XR policy. While immersive technologies are often associated with gaming and entertainment, their applications are much broader and include education, workforce training, and design. Research by Statista shows that the global XR market reached $29.26 billion in 2022 and is predicted to rise to over $100 billion by 2026. These emerging technologies offer opportunities for immersive training simulations and innovative solutions, changing how we work and learn. For example, Ford utilized AR technology to transform its design process. Ford&#8217;s design team visualizes potential car designs by overlaying them onto physical prototypes in real scale. Walmart stores in the U.S. have VR headsets with on-demand training, allowing over 1.4 million associates to access cashier and holiday rush immersive learning modules. As immersive technologies continue to advance at a rapid pace, policymakers face a broad range of challenges, including privacy, security, safety, access and adoption, equity and inclusion, and economic and workforce considerations like leveraging XR to boost productivity. During BPC convenings, privacy emerged as a top concern regarding XR tools, with a specific focus on protecting user and bystander privacy and sensitive biometric data. XR devices face similar security risks as other technologies, such as malware attacks and data breaches and theft. Building public trust in XR hinges on safeguarding users&#8217; sensitive information. To work towards establishing a robust XR policy framework, policymakers should review existing laws and identify regulatory gaps. This process should be ongoing and involve reviewing and modernizing existing policies to ensure they are adequate and adaptable to the dynamic nature of technology. Flexible soft law approaches, such as standards and frameworks, can take less time than legislation and also play a significant role in rapidly addressing many challenges and building public trust. For instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed voluntary frameworks for privacy and cybersecurity that could be applied to immersive technologies. Embracing a proactive approach to policy can create an environment that encourages responsible XR development and adoption, while ensuring both innovation and societal well-being. Extensive public engagement and education about the concerns associated with XR and immersive technologies can mitigate distrust and help leverage the benefits, while also upholding civil liberties, promoting safety, and fostering inclusivity. Policymakers, industry, civil society, and other stakeholders should make public engagement a high priority as the XR market continues to grow. By adopting a forward-looking and multistakeholder approach, we can seize the immense potential of XR, shaping the future to better benefit individuals, communities, and society as a whole.",

    "content": "In a fitting start to a patriotic weekend, Reps. David Valadao (R-CA) and Susie Lee (D-NV) chose to spend the Friday of Memorial Day weekend on an American Congressional Exchange trip. The pair toured Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District including a critical minerals mine, an innovation hub, and Lake Mead. The two members represent neighboring states with much in common, including strong agricultural production and water resource challenges—fittingly, the trip came just a few days after the historic water agreement between California, Nevada, and Arizona. The day began with a tour of Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine, a critical minerals mine that procures elements crucial to magnets used in the burgeoning electric vehicles (EV) industry. Mountain Pass leaders highlighted the challenges they face, including the stranglehold China currently has on this market. For example, a remarkable 15% of the world’s materials for EV magnets come from the Mountain Pass mine but are subsequently shipped to China for processing. The second stop was Black Fire Innovation in Las Vegas, the centerpiece of applied research and innovation for the University of Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV). By combining the power of big tech with the research resources of UNLV, the center accelerates progress in the hospitality, gaming, and entertainment industries. The two members toured the technology incubator, which is focused on fast-tracking the testing process for new innovations, and heard from leaders how the federal government can bolster their innovation efforts. Next stop: Lake Mead, where guests can see the drop in water level over the past 23 years, which is obvious from the dramatically different coloration in the rocky shoreline. Included in the visit were officials from the Southern Nevada Water Authority, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, National Park Service, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the Colorado River Commission of Nevada. Looking out over the lake, Reps. Lee and Valadao discussed the significance of the trip along with how to balance environmental protection and future water yields with agriculture, economic development, and population growth. Finally, the day concluded at the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center. Both members were impressed with this federally funded “fusion center,” where law enforcement across 20 agencies shares information in real-time. The center supports local, regional, and national partners and accesses threats and suspicious activity reporting to prevent acts of terrorism and targeted violence. Reps. Lee and Valadao’s trip was the third ACE trip of 2023, with more planned throughout the summer.",

    "content": "BPC submitted comments in response to a Request for Information issued by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to solicit feedback on how the agency should deploy Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding to improve environmental reviews. Drawing from BPC’s on permitting, the comments recommend several actions FHWA should take to build upon prior reforms while maintaining a focus on public engagement and environmental protection. Specifically, the comments recommend that FHWA:  Encourage greater use of promising strategies, such as programmatic approaches rather than project-by-project reviews; the assignment program by which states assume more responsibility for environmental reviews; categorical exclusions that allow for a simplified process for projects with minimal environmental impact; and “Dig Once” policies that encourage coordination across sectors to accomplish multiple goals while minimizing delays.  Provide new templates and tools, such as standard language for memorandums of understanding between states and the federal government and mapping tools to assist communities in early identification of sensitive areas.  Increase transparency by developing a public database of all environmental actions taken or in progress for highway, rail, and transit projects, including the dates of key milestones and links to relevant documents.  Coordinate with other federal agencies to expand use of the government-wide Permitting Dashboard and develop a single federal platform for submitting and sharing environmental documents.  Provide grants to fund early public engagement with local leaders and community members to build consensus around the scope and design of projects.  Create a challenge fund to support innovative activities at the state or local level to catalyze long-term improvements in permitting.  These actions would build upon the permitting reforms enacted in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and, most recently, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, and would empower state and local agencies to more efficiently deliver cleaner, safer, and more resilient transportation for their communities. ",

    "content": "This blog is part of our “Road to Reauthorization” blog series, that builds off BPC’s latest small business report, Small Agency, Big Mandate: A Bipartisan Road Map to Modernizing SBA. The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. You can read the first four blogs in our series on congressional support for reauthorization here, here, here, and here. Proponents of modernizing the Small Business Administration (SBA), including the Bipartisan Policy Center, emphasize that it has been nearly 23 years since Congress last reauthorized SBA. While it’s been a long time since comprehensive reauthorization of the agency, it’s a misunderstanding to think Congress has been derelict in its responsibilities to America’s small businesses since 2000. The House Small Business and Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committees have provided critical oversight and worked in bipartisan fashion over the past two decades to make updates and improvements to SBA. Much of this work has been bipartisan, reflecting Democrats’ and Republicans’ longstanding commitment to supporting small businesses. That work continues in the 118th Congress. After the House passed three bipartisan bills in January, the House Small Business Committee held a markup in late May, moving six bills forward for further consideration. Each had bipartisan cosponsors and received bipartisan support at markup. Capital Instances of fraud in SBA-managed COVID relief programs have been top-of-mind for many lawmakers. Bipartisan questions about changes to SBA’s 7(a) loan guaranty program recently made through regulatory rulemaking have increased members’ interest in oversight. On May 23, the House Small Business Committee reported two bills—H.R. 1644, the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight Act, and , the Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act—aimed at strengthening oversight of the 7(a) loan program by instituting new requirements for 7(a) loan agents. Counseling The American Express Small Business Financial Confidence Report, released in late May, found that 51% of small businesses surveyed are currently hiring. While it has always been the case that small businesses need qualified and talented workers to help their businesses grow, workforce challenges have been particularly vexing since the start of the pandemic. The House Small Business Committee passed two bills to help small businesses meet their workforce needs. H.R. 1730, the Supporting Small Business and Career and Technical Education Act, directs Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) and Women’s Business Centers to help small businesses hire graduates from career and technical education programs. Similarly, the committee approved H.R. 1541, the Small Business Workforce Pipeline Act, which expands the suite of services SBDCs provide to also include information on how small businesses can establish apprenticeships and work-based learning opportunities. The Committee also passed H.R. 1606, the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2023, which reauthorizes an SBA-run program that provides entrepreneurship training to veterans and active members of the armed forces. Contracting The federal government has met its goal of awarding at least 3% of prime contracts to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans for the past 10 years. Yet not all 24&hellip;",

    "content": "As part of a bipartisan deal to raise the debt ceiling, the Fiscal Responsibility Act includes several reforms to the federal permitting and environmental review process recommended by BPC’s Smarter, Cleaner, Faster Infrastructure Task Force. This blog provides an overview of the four sections of the bill related to permitting, noting which of these provisions align with the task force’s recommendations released in 2021. Section 321: Builder Act Clarifies the Scope of NEPA: The bill amends the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements for detailed statements on federal actions affecting the environment, narrowing agency considerations to address environmental effects that are “reasonably foreseeable.” The bill also adds language narrowing the review of alternatives to the proposed action to those that are “technically and economically feasible and fit the purpose and need of the project,” clarifying that these should include “a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed action, including an analysis of any negative environmental impacts of not implementing the proposed agency action.” The bill also adds language requiring the use of scientific integrity and reliable data to implement NEPA. See the line edits to NEPA Section 102 below: New NEPA Provisions: In addition to the above language modifying existing NEPA statute, the bill adds six new sections to NEPA. Procedure for determination of level of review: Outlines circumstances where agencies are not required to prepare an environmental document, including: if the proposed agency action is not a “final agency action”; the action is covered by a categorical exclusion; the preparation of such a document would clearly violate another law; or if the agency cannot take environmental factors into consideration because the action is nondiscretionary. Clarifies that an agency shall issue an environmental impact statement (EIS) for actions that have a “reasonably foreseeable significant effect on the quality of the human environment,” and shall prepare a “concise” environmental assessment (EA) for actions that do not have such reasonably foreseeable significant effects or the effects are unknown, unless the action is covered by a categorical exclusion. Agencies are not required to undertake new scientific or technical research for environmental reviews unless such research is essential for a reasoned analysis. Timely and unified federal reviews: Codifies principles of the One Federal Decision initiative, requiring multi-agency reviews to have one lead agency that must supervise all cooperating agencies’ preparation of environmental documents, develop a schedule for review, and use a single environmental document for evaluation. The lead agency may also appoint a state or local agency as a joint lead agency. ★ Aligns with BPC recommendations Sets page limits for environmental documents: a maximum of 150 pages for EISs, with an exception for extraordinary complex statements that allows up to 300 pages, and a maximum of 75 pages for EAs. (Though not a task force recommendation, this proposal was included in a BPC letter with recommendations to CEQ). Lead agencies shall establish procedures to allow project sponsors to prepare EAs or EISs with the agency doing an independent review and taking responsibility for&hellip;",

    "content": "While high-skilled legal immigrants can be essential to a competitive and robust economy, the outdated U.S. immigration system creates significant barriers to retaining them, often discouraging qualified individuals who were educated and trained in the U.S. from working here permanently. A recent BPC-Morning Consult poll showed that many Americans support efforts to retain high-skilled immigrants, and believe they have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. Research has shown that skilled immigrants drive innovation, create jobs, and fill critical labor gaps. Moreover, persistent labor shortages, a result of an aging U.S. population, coupled with declining birth rates require innovative solutions to ensure an adequate supply of workers to fill in-demand skilled positions. Policy action focused on retaining current immigrant workers and attracting more high-skilled immigrants would ensure the U.S. has the workforce to maintain competitiveness. Importance of and need for high-skilled immigrants High-skilled immigrants could have a central role in advancing efforts to support innovative research by increasing the number of professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields that are in dire need of talent. Based on classifications created by the Standard Occupational Classification Policy Committee, STEM workers include computer and mathematical occupations, engineers and engineering technicians, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists, science technicians, and STEM managers. The work of skilled foreign employees complements the work done by their native counterparts. Examples of complementary occupations are office and administrative support workers and financial specialists; and health and personal care aids and doctors and surgeons. Research has found that the work done by high skill immigrants, particularly in the STEM industry, boosts economic growth per capita and increases overall wages for workers Meanwhile, U.S. Census Bureau data suggests that the American education system does not produce enough STEM professionals, further highlighting the need for increasing and retaining high-skilled immigrants. Specifically, three out of every four undergraduates with a STEM degree go on to work outside of the STEM field after graduating. However, of international students studying in the U.S., nearly half are enrolled in STEM-related programs and more than one-third of all doctorates in science and engineering are international students. While some students will return home upon completion of their degree, many of these students hope to stay permanently and participate in the labor market. Barriers to entry and retention Yet high-skilled foreign students face significant barriers in coming to and staying in the U.S. due to complicated immigration processes, long wait times, and limited availability of visas. H-1B visas are the primary immigration pathway for workers with at least a bachelor’s degree. For those lucky enough to get one of the coveted 85,000 visas issued by lottery to employers each year, transitioning from H-1B status to permanent residency can take several years and a green card is not guaranteed. The process is not only difficult for immigrants but complicates the hiring processes for U.S. companies when hires are dependent on acquiring a green card within a short timeframe.

    "content": "New federal grants provide an opportunity to address a major barrier to electric vehicle (EV) adoption—too few places to charge near drivers’ homes. In late 2022, the Biden administration approved all 50 state plans to utilize funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program. This year the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation has turned its attention to the BIL’s other major grant program intended to support charging infrastructure—the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) program, a $2.5 billion competitive grant program. Applications for $700 million in grants are due in June.  Whereas the NEVI program is designed to build out a national network of chargers along major highways to support longer trips, the CFI program includes funding to increase charging access within communities for local residents to make day-to-day trips, particularly in underserved neighborhoods. Due to their distinct goals, the two programs support the deployment of different kinds of chargers. The NEVI grant supports faster Level 3 chargers better suited for quick stops to recharge on long trips while the CFI program will mainly fund Level 2 chargers, which are less expensive to install and useful for charging while drivers park at work or overnight.  Of the total $2.5 billion the BIL authorized for this program, $700 million is available for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, divided evenly between two funding categories: Community Grants are to install publicly accessible charging stations anywhere they will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fill in gaps in access to chargers. Eligible locations include public roads or other accessible locations such as parking facilities at public buildings, public schools, or in publicly accessible parking facilities owned by a private entity. Corridor Grants are to install chargers along DOT-designated alternative fuels corridors, supplementing the NEVI formula grant to fill in gaps in the national network of chargers. States, local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, and transportation authorities can apply for the funding directly—unlike the NEVI grant, which was distributed to state governments to set up statewide grant programs. In addition to EV chargers, eligible projects include hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling infrastructure. Community Grant recipients may contract with a private entity to acquire and install infrastructure, while Corridor Grant recipients must contract with private entities—providing an opportunity for public-private partnerships. For both grant programs, the federal share of total project costs cannot exceed 80%. The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation has made clear that a primary goal of the Community Grants is to advance the Biden administration’s Justice40 initiative, an effort to direct 40% of the benefits from federal investments to disadvantaged and underserved communities. To support this effort, DOT released an EV Charging Justice40 Map Tool for grant applicants to determine which areas are underserved. Community Grants will prioritize applications that expand access to charging in rural areas, low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and communities with a low ratio of private parking spaces to households, or a high ratio of multi-unit dwellings to single-family homes.

    "content": "Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released their finalized rule on share repurchases, also known as stock buy backs. The rule updates disclosure requirements for an issuer’s share repurchase activities. Background In brief, share repurchases occur when a company decides to repurchase their own shares from the market. Shares are repurchased for a variety of business reasons and occasionally for nefarious purposes. As a result, companies have to disclose their share repurchase plans. The issue of share repurchases has become contentious as competing interests debate who benefits from the repurchases. Traditionally, companies engage in share repurchases when they determine that their stock is undervalued. When shares are repurchased the predominate response is an increased value of the outstanding shares. As a result, the increased value benefits shareholders. Some argue, however, that instead of efficiently returning capital to investors, issuers should invest that money in better wages, increased benefits, or additional research and development. The SEC’s rationale for the rule was that companies may be repurchasing shares for nefarious purposes, so investors need exceedingly detailed data about the share repurchase process. The rule appears to disregard the prevailing academic view that companies are engaging in this process for appropriate reasons. Unfortunately, these new requirements, coupled with the new 1% excise tax on share repurchases, will be costly and either deter businesses from using the process or pass the costs on to customers and shareholders. This will ultimately place the interests of shareholders against other stakeholders, including employees. BPC had hoped that the SEC would consider the implications of their new rule (and tax) on the broader economy. A BPC white paper on share repurchases in July 2022 posited a novel approach to how share repurchases could be analyzed. The paper argued that the politics surrounding share repurchases should be dispensed with and share repurchases should be evaluated under a &#8220;dynamic approach&#8221; that ensures the most efficacious use of capital. The paper noted academic studies which found that when companies redeploy capital, they can increase savings, investment, and purchasing power. The paper also noted that share repurchases can be the catalyst for growth in small companies who are the leading job creators and are at the forefront of innovation. In sum, &#8220;repurchases affect far more than just the employees and shareholders of one company.&#8221; So, what&#8217;s in the rule? First, there is a required disclosure of daily purchases, as well as a company&#8217;s repurchase policies and procedures, on a quarterly or semi-annually basis. The daily purchases requirement includes a tabular disclosure of an issuer&#8217;s repurchase activity aggregated on a daily basis. This includes the: Class, average price, and total number of shares purchased including those purchased as part of an issuer’s repurchase plan; Aggregate maximum number or dollar amount that are or may be purchased on the open market; and Total number purchased as intended to qualify under the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions (Rule 10b-8) and to satisfy the &#8220;affirmative defense conditions&#8221; (Rule 10b5-1(c)). In addition, the issuer must disclose&hellip;",

    "content": "Since the time of publication, the Fiscal Responsibility Act rescinded approximately $1.4 billion from the Internal Revenue Service over the next 10 years. Congress also agreed to reprogram another $20 billion of the agency’s funding in fiscal years 2024 and 2025. On April 6, 2023, the Internal Revenue Service released its Strategic Operating Plan outlining the agency’s 10-year vision for deploying the $80 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Bipartisan Policy Center has long called for adequate funding to ensure the IRS can: Provide timely support and assistance to improve the taxpayer experience; Effectively administer critical social programs, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC), through the tax code; and Reduce the tax gap—the difference between taxes collected and taxes owed—through audits and compliance actions. Additionally, the funding is likely to yield a net positive return, as the Congressional Budget Office estimates it will increase gross federal revenue by approximately $180 billion through 2031 by improving taxpayer services and enforcement capacities. The agency’s plan addresses longstanding concerns about inadequate customer service, outdated information technology, and tax enforcement, with some actions already implemented during the 2023 tax filing season. The IRS frontloaded spending to improve the taxpayer experience, hiring over 5,000 new customer service representatives, increasing the agency’s level of service—the success rate of taxpayers who call  seeking assistance from customer service representatives—from 15% in 2022 to 87% in 2023, reopening Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) nationwide to offer more in-person assistance, and improving online processing of paper forms. Addressing ineffective tax administration has historically garnered bipartisan support; proposals to shrink the tax gap, in particular, have been introduced by every administration since President Reagan. A bolstered IRS will allow for much needed modernizations, however, as with all such funding, authorization is only half the battle. Effectively appropriating resources and implementing needed reforms is the critical next step—and it will not be easy. The following elements of the agency’s plan are what BPC will be watching as they align closely with our past recommendations for reform. The growing complexity of the tax code, coupled with persistent understaffing and declining budgets exacerbated during the pandemic, has hindered the IRS’s ability to effectively educate and assist taxpayers throughout the filing process. Low rates of calls answered by customer service representatives, long average wait times, and poorly trained representatives have left taxpayers shortchanged when engaging with the IRS on questions or concerns regarding tax filing. The following provisions of the IRS plan, which align with BPC recommendations, would address these concerns. Recruit, train, and retain a skilled IRS workforce to improve taxpayer services: The IRS will upgrade hiring practices to attract a workforce with the needed diverse skillsets to operate modernized IT systems. Additionally, efforts to streamline employee training nationwide should improve knowledge of tax administration and enable employees to better respond to taxpayer questions and concerns.

The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. You can read the first three blogs in our series on congressional support for reauthorization here, here, and here.   Within SBA lies a small but highly important independent office charged with being the voice of small business owners within the entire federal government: the Office of Advocacy. Led by a chief counsel for advocacy, this office represents the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process, produces research to inform government policy, and conducts outreach to small businesses.  In April, BPC had the opportunity to discuss the Office of Advocacy’s role in the regulatory process and small business data collection with two former chief counsels: Dr. Winslow Sargeant and Thomas Sullivan, who served in the Obama and Bush administrations, respectively. Highlights from that conversation follow.  Ensuring Compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act  The Office of Advocacy is responsible for “monitoring and reporting on federal agency compliance” with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). Recognizing that small businesses have fewer resources to comply with federal regulations and may, therefore, be impacted in outsized ways, Congress charged federal agencies with considering the effects of their rulemaking on small businesses. The RFA requires agencies to consider regulatory alternatives if a regulation is expected to have a “significant economic impact” on a substantial number of small businesses.  “There are folks that believe the Regulatory Flexibility Act is intended to stop regulation—and that’s actually just not the case.” – Tom Sullivan  “The goal is to make sure that the regulatory process is clear, transparent, and predictable.” – Dr. Winslow Sargeant  “The Office of Advocacy is charged by law to take an independent voice on behalf of small businesses, whether or not that is consistent with the policies and regulatory proposals issued by the White House and the Administration.” – Tom Sullivan  “We have to make sure that the RFA is strengthened. The strength of the Office, the tools that the Office has, are, one, the RFA, which was passed in 1980. And so that gives the Chief Counsel and those within the Office a roadmap in terms of how it should deal with regulatory structure and also deal with other agencies.” – Dr. Winslow Sargeant  Bolstering Data Collection About Small Business  High-quality and timely data is essential to informed policymaking. The Office of Advocacy’s important role in producing research based on public and private data can be strengthened, in part by greater data sharing within the federal government.  “Strong regulations are based upon data.” – Dr. Winslow Sargeant  Confirming a Chief Counsel  The Office of Advocacy has been without a Senate-confirmed chief counsel for more than six years.

    "content": "How accurate are face recognition technologies, and how well do they perform? There is no simple answer, but this third piece in the series on five key face recognition technology governance challenges explains some of what publicly available third-party testing data reveals. Specifically, this piece shares insights from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) program and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) Biometric Technology Rallies. This piece also considers other types of testing that could be helpful. In a deployment setting, assessing face recognition systems’ “performance” depends on user requirements and priorities. Each aspect of the face recognition system, including algorithm accuracy, image capture device quality, system speed and calibration, deployment environmental conditions, and the human operator’s effectiveness, impacts the full system’s ability to achieve user requirements and priorities. Different types of face recognition technology testing evaluate different face recognition system components under different settings. Each type of testing provides insight into one or more aspects of face recognition systems’ performance, but no single test currently provides a dispositive answer to the broad question of how well face recognition technologies perform &nbsp; Five Key Face Recognition Technology Governance Challenges: 1. Many terms and definitions 2. Many functional applications 3. Many use cases 4. Many ways to assess technical accuracy and performance 5. Many sociotechnical risks and benefits that differ depending on the accuracy and performance of the technology, functional application, and use case. The NIST FRVT program evaluates face recognition algorithms that vendors voluntarily submit for benchmark testing. NIST evaluates both face verification (“one-to-one” or “1:1”) and face identification (“one-to-many” or “1:N”) algorithms and assesses overall accuracy and accuracy across specific demographic groups. (The first blog in this series explains the difference between face identification, face verification, and other technologies that analyze human faces.) &nbsp; Although these tests are not the focus of this explainer piece, NIST also evaluates face recognition algorithms&#8217; ability to deal with presentation attacks and morphs. Additionally, NIST tests quality assessment algorithms that vendors incorporate into face recognition systems to help determine whether a probe image is suitable for use in the face recognition system. To perform overall and demographic-specific accuracy tests, NIST uses probe and gallery images of varying styles and quality, such as passport, mugshot, border crossing, and webcam photos. NIST also evaluates algorithm performance across galleries of multiple sizes. Because NIST tests hundreds of algorithms from many developers in a standardized format, FRVT testing provides useful information about how well individual algorithms perform tasks and the overall state and trajectory of face recognition algorithm accuracy across the market. (Analyzing historical NIST testing data demonstrates that face recognition algorithms have become increasingly accurate over time.) Below, this piece summarizes test results that provide insight into (1) face identification algorithms’ overall accuracy, (2) face verification algorithms’ overall accuracy, and (3) face identification and face verification algorithms’ accuracy across demographic groups.

Taamneh and Gonzalez v Google provided no significant changes to the interpretation or understanding of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. For now, the court decided not to reexamine the long-established law. Though calls for Congress to address content moderation have grown louder, Democrats and Republicans have put forth conflicting approaches. The Bipartisan Policy Center filed an amicus brief arguing that bipartisan compromises can be reached to address harmful or illegal content online and that Congress is best suited to deliberate any potential changes to Section 230. Two other cases concerning legislation in Texas and Florida are pending the court&#8217;s solicitors&#8217; review to grant cert, which, if it happens, would be in the Fall of 2023 if it did happen. Below are key excerpts from the opinions issued in Twitter and Gonzalez. These quotes present the intricate nature of the internet and the intersectionality of laws governing our online ecosystem. From Twitter v. Taamneh On the liability of communications providers in aiding and abetting terrorist acts: “it might be that bad actors like ISIS are able to use platforms like defendants’ for illegal—and sometimes terrible—ends. But the same could be said of cell phones, email, or the internet generally. Yet, we generally do not think that internet or cell service providers incur culpability merely for providing their services to the public writ large. Nor do we think that such providers would normally be described as aiding and abetting, for example, illegal drug deals brokered over cell phones—even if the provider’s conference-call or video-call features made the sale easier.” On the role of algorithms in aiding and providing substantial assistance to terrorist act: “presented here, the algorithms appear agnostic as to the nature of the content, matching any content (including ISIS’ content) with any user who is more likely to view that content… Once the platform and sorting-tool algorithms were up and running, defendants at most allegedly stood back and watched; they are not alleged to have taken any further action with respect to ISIS.” Recognizing the scale of content published on online platforms: “It appears that for every minute of the day, approximately 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube, 510,000 comments are posted on Facebook, and 347,000 tweets are sent on Twitter.” Justice Jackson, concurring opinion: “Both cases came to this Court at the motion- to-dismiss stage, with no factual record. And the Court’s view of the facts—including its characterizations of the social-media platforms and algorithms at issue—properly rests on the particular allegations in those complaints. Other cases presenting different allegations and different records may lead to different conclusions.” From Gonzalez v Google On the significance of Section 230 in this case: “it has become clear that plaintiffs’ complaint—independent of §230—states little if any claim for relief. As plaintiffs concede, the allegations underlying their secondary-liability claims are materially identical to those at issue in Twitter.”",

As Erin Pelton, Shopify&#8217;s vice president of communications and public affairs, noted during this event, Shopify offers an “operating system” for small businesses and entrepreneurs to help run and grow their companies. The event, “Pulse Check: How Small Businesses Perform Amid Economic Uncertainty,” also explored how policymakers can support small businesses. Two members of the House Small Business Committee, Rep. Marc Molinaro (R-NY) and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA), joined to provide their perspective. A panel discussion included Pelton, Anika Hobbs, founder and owner of Nubian Hueman, and John Dearie, founder and president of the Center for American Entrepreneurship. Participants discussed the current state of small business, public policy, and the recently launched Shopify Entrepreneurship Index, a new quarterly tool that compares countries and U.S. states based on the performance of Shopify entrepreneurs. In addition to the broad issue of inflation, the two members of Congress highlighted continuing workforce challenges facing small businesses. Here are additional takeaways and highlights from the event. The Economic Importance and Role of Small Business “We’re completely digital. Even though we’re in a brick-and-mortar space, everything is digital. We don’t really paper anything. … Inventory, scheduling, every aspect that you can probably think of.” —Anika Hobbs | Founder and Owner, Nubian Hueman “It’s a great time to be an entrepreneur.” —Erin Pelton | Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs, Shopify Access to Capital “One of the reasons that I ran for Congress was because of my experience applying for an SBA loan to purchase our building. I spent a year applying for a 504 loan to purchase our building. … This application was the size of a phone book. When you think about the barriers that presents to other business owners, the amount of time it takes to run a business, and then to spend this additional time.” —Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) Workforce “Workforce is a huge piece, it’s a huge piece.” —Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) &nbsp; “Eighty percent of those with intellectual, physical, and developmental disabilities are unemployed. Eighty percent. There are millions of Americans who are neurodivergent … that if we were to redefine job descriptions, if we were to break down some of the government regulations, and incentivize hiring those individuals … this is an opportunity not only to grow the workforce but to really encourage people who have never experienced the benefit of earning a paycheck and going to a job where&hellip;",

    "content": "A November 2022 poll found that most voters still use search engines to find trusted election information. For most of the internet age, search engines sorted through an index of websites that are relevant to a user’s search terms. Today, we’re witnessing a shift from that format as popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools become more mainstream.  Researchers and everyday people are leveraging tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, or Microsoft’s Bing chatbot as a potential alternative to established search engines, offering voters a promising source for election information. However, problems with incompleteness, timeliness, and inaccurate information in prompts limit its effectiveness. We found a number of instances of misleading or incomplete information about how to vote, which can cause confusion or hinder a voter’s ability to exercise the right to vote effectively.   Until these problems are addressed, voters should continue using their preferred authoritative sources for election information, and developers should take meaningful steps to address concerns about the reliability of their tools. For this blog, we chose to focus on one tool i.e., ChatGPT. However, there are similar tools that we will focus on in future research.  What is ChatGPT  ChatGPT is trained to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to various prompts. Since ChatGPT is trained on millions of human-written sources and continually learns from human feedback, it can generate human-like responses. It is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data from books, Wikipedia, research articles, websites, social media platforms, code, and datasets &#8211; like Webtext, which consists of over 8 million web pages – but the majority of this training data was published before September 2021.   How effective is ChatGPT? To gauge the effectiveness of ChatGPT in providing accurate election information, we used the state of Illinois as a use case and asked ChatGPT about:   Voting eligibility criteria  Voting locations  Methods of voting  Current congressional candidates  Note: This research was completed before GPT-4 was released on March 14. OpenAI claims “GPT-4 scores 40% higher than GPT-3.5 on our internal adversarial factuality evaluations” meaning GPT-4 may produce more factually reliable information.  Voting Eligibility Criteria We started by asking a broad question about the eligibility criteria to vote in Illinois, and ChatGPT responded with the correct voting eligibility requirements, including citizenship requirements, voting age, and residential requirements. It’s response also included the correct deadline to register to vote, 28 days. Since the model learns from human feedback, we wanted to evaluate the consistency in its response. We asked the same question three times and got a few different responses. For example, in two of three answers, the bot included ‘Not be declared mentally incompetent by a court of law’ as an eligibility criterion and mentioned ‘Not claim the right to vote anywhere else,’ in one instance, but not the other two. It is important to note that inconsistent or incomplete answers may mislead users. If voters have questions or concerns related to voting in their jurisdiction, they should check with their state or local election&hellip;",

Campus Happenings More than 70 Harvard Faculty Form Council on Academic Freedom, Co-Led by Steven Pinker Rahem D. Hamid and Elias J. Schisgall | The Harvard Crimson | April 14, 2023 More than 70 Harvard University professors came together to found the Council on Academic Freedom. Two of its six co-presidents, professors Steven Pinker and Bertha Madras, announced the initiative in a Boston Globe op-ed, writing that members concluded that academic freedom needs a “defense team.” The council will sponsor events, educate new faculty, and respond to threats to academic freedom. Hundreds Protest, Attend Lecture of Conservative Commentator Matt Walsh at UI Liam Halawith and Emily Delgado| Daily Iowan| April 20, 2023 A University of Iowa student organization sponsored a lecture with Q&amp;A by a critic of transgenderism. The event was attended by a capacity audience of 750 and proceeded without disruption, while hundreds protested outside. Prior to the event, the school’s administration coordinated with event organizers and protestors to ensure compliance with the Code of Student Life; LGBTQ+ and other clubs issued statements, organized counter events, and chalked to protest. West Texas A&amp;M University Releases Results of No-Confidence Vote on President Walter Wendler Caden Keenan and Angel Oliva | My High Plains | April 25, 2023 Following President Walter Wendler’s decision to cancel a drag show, 69% of the faculty voted no-confidence in his leadership, with 70% of the faculty casting a ballot. The no-confidence resolution charged, “President Wendler has acted contrary to WT’s commitment to academic freedom and ‘champion the free exchange of ideas’ through prohibiting previously approved on-campus activities contrary to his personal worldview.” President Wendler responded that he was disappointed but did not plan to step down. New College of Florida Drama Continues as Trustees Deny Tenure for 5 Faculty Ian Hodgson | Tampa Bay Times | April 26, 2023 The College of Florida Board of Trustees, by a 4-9 vote in each case, denied tenure to five professors who had been recommended for tenure by the interim provost. Among those voting against tenure were all six trustees recently appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Critics charges political motives for denying tenure to the candidates, who are eligible to reapply for tenure. The faculty representative on the board resigned from the school, effective at the end of the academic year.

    "content": "The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is the nation’s largest and most significant affordable rental production program. Since its inception in 1987, the LIHTC has supported the construction or rehabilitation of about 110,000 affordable rental homes per year, financing more than  3.7 million affordable homes in total. By leveraging private capital to meet the critical housing needs of vulnerable populations, the LIHTC is one of the federal government’s primary policy tools for addressing the shortage of affordable housing in the United States. Despite the LIHTC’s centrality in the country’s affordable housing landscape, its time-bound affordability requirements pose a challenge to sustaining a sufficient affordable housing stock over the long term. Recent studies have warned that thousands of affordable LIHTC units have started phasing out of these affordability requirements and point to the need for greater resources to maintain and expand the number of affordable homes available to low-income renters. This blog provides context on LIHTC affordability periods, discusses strategies to preserve affordable units for longer or in perpetuity, and highlights bipartisan proposals to strengthen the policy. The Basics of LIHTC Affordability Periods The LIHTC incentivizes developers to build and maintain affordable housing for low-income households by leveraging tax credits to lower their costs. Unlike other federal affordable housing programs, the LIHTC is not funded through congressional appropriations. Rather, Congress provides the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with the authority to issue tax credits to each state based on its population size, with a minimum for states with small populations. States receive a fixed number of tax credits annually, which state housing finance agencies (HFAs) then allocate to developers through a competitive process. Developers sell these credits to investors who, in turn, use them to offset their federal income taxes, raising capital for affordable housing properties. In exchange for the tax credits, developers agree to provide and maintain a certain number of affordable homes for a specified period. LIHTC developers must abide by affordability requirements laid out in the so-called 20-50 test, in which at least 20% of units must be occupied by tenants earning no more than 50% of area median income (AMI), or the 40-60 test, in which at least 40% of the units must be occupied by residents earning no more than 60% of AMI. As of 2018, new income averaging provisions allow LIHTC owners to serve households earning as much as 80% of AMI as long as the average income limit in the property does not exceed 60% of AMI. There are two types of LIHTCs available to developers: the 9% credit and 4% credit. The former is typically reserved for new construction, while the latter is reserved for rehabilitation or construction financed using other subsidies, particularly federally tax-exempt bonds called private activity bonds (PABs). From 1986 to 1989, federal LIHTC provisions included a 15-year compliance period. Beginning in 1990, Congress created an “extended use period” of an additional 15 years, for a total of 30 years. Though LIHTC property owners are still able to opt out of&hellip;",

    "content": "The practice of inviting guest speakers to college and university campuses is a longstanding tradition aiming to foster diversity of thought and enrich the educational experience.  Frequently, the views and beliefs of a speaker will conflict with those held by some members of the campus community––reflecting a healthy campus climate where ideas are debated and orthodoxies are challenged. However, recent controversies such as the shout down of a federal judge at Stanford Law School, a conservative media figure at University at Albany, and constitutional scholar at University of California, Hastings College of Law (now U.C. College of Law, San Francisco), have highlighted the challenges of hosting speakers on campus and overriding the heckler’s veto.    Originally coined by University of Chicago legal scholar Harry Kalven, Jr. in his 1965 book, The Negro and the First Amendment, the “heckler’s veto” occurs when an individual or group disrupts or restricts speech through excessive noise, intimidation, or violence. It is not intermittent shouting, opposition, or even criticism, but rather substantial disruption that prevents a speaker from being heard.   Some defend the heckler&#8217;s veto as a form of counter-speech, protected by the First Amendment. However, the disruptor’s goal is to suppress other&#8217;s speech––often suggesting the speaker’s ideas are dangerous or harmful––not merely countering it. In fact, according to a 2022 Knight Foundation-Ipsos national survey, 1 in 4 students favor disinviting speakers whose speech is perceived as offensive or biased. Similarly, 13% of students in a 2020 Gallup-Knight Foundation survey regard it as at least sometimes acceptable to use violence to silence a speaker.  The heckler’s veto is antithetical to the fundamental mission of the university: to pursue and transmit knowledge through the exploration of ideas, even those perceived as controversial. How can universities respond to the use of a heckler&#8217;s veto in a way that maintains an inclusive campus culture, encourages tolerance of views, and allows for protest without silencing speakers?  Contemporary Examples of the Heckler&#8217;s Veto  Episodes span the ideological spectrum and involve shout downs, barring entrances, threats of violence, and other unique methods of silencing speakers.  Prior to the shout down of a federal judge at Stanford Law School, the most well-known instance of the heckler&#8217;s veto occurred in 2017 at Middlebury College, where students shouted down Charles Murray, a political scientist and scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. After students disrupted the event, administrators improvised a studio to livestream his speech. While Charles Murry delivered his lecture virtually, it denied students the opportunity to hear him in person and participate in the planned Q&amp;A.  State and federal officials from both parties have faced difficulties on campus. In 2017, Xavier Becerra, then-California Attorney General, was shouted down at Whitter College by pro-Trump community members. In 2019, then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was shouted down when he attempted to deliver a keynote address at Georgetown University.  Students have also deployed the heckler&#8217;s veto by impeding event access. In 2017, students at Claremont McKenna College forced administrators to livestream a lecture by essayist&hellip;",

    "content": "An aging workforce and increased threats have spurred an alarming increase in election official retirements and resignations. A Brennan Center for Justice survey of local election officials found that one in five local election officials plan to leave their role before 2024, citing politicians’ attacks on the system, stress, and retirement plans as primary reasons. Another wave of retirements and resignations is likely to follow the 2024 election. With 88% percent of election offices operating with fewer than six full-time staff members, already under-resourced election offices risk being spread even more thin than usual  during a contentious presidential election. Creating a talent pipeline within Generation Z will help fill labor shortages in election administration in the long-term and bring new perspectives and ideas to election offices who constantly must adapt to changing rules and public expectations. Institutional Knowledge Meets Technical Acumen There is a widening gap between the increasingly technological nature of election administration and the demographic that comprises most election employees. Election offices rely heavily on technology to function: Officials regularly use geographical information systems to validate precinct and district boundaries, absentee ballot tracking , electronic poll books to identify and check in voters, and ballot scanners to tabulate results. In a crowded and contentious information environment, election officials must now be on the front line of efforts to promote accurate election information, including on social media. With proper training, Generation Z digital natives are well-equipped to become election workers, which would increase the speed and efficiency of completing technical tasks and improve the social media literacy of election offices. Integrating the institutional knowledge of current election administrators with the technology prowess of younger generations could result in improved perception of and trust in elections for years to come. College and University Partnerships To prepare the next generation for leadership in public administration, election offices should develop partnerships with community colleges and universities so students can get first-hand experience working in public service positions. 79% of students say they would like to participate in internships as part of their college experience. Arizona State University’s Legislative and Government Program is a good example of this model. It provides students with an opportunity to intern full-time at the Secretary of State’s Office. Students with coursework in public policy, public administration, or government receive course credit and a stipend, and work with staff on basic clerical tasks and reviewing documents , while gaining experience in public service . These programs provide interested students the opportunity to gain work experience in an election office  while alleviating public service workforce shortages. When election offices create stronger relationships with college campuses—through student led organizations, political science courses, or formal internship and apprenticeship programs—students learn of often overlooked career pathways in public service while election administrators cultivate a new stream of civically engaged personnel. With election official retirements and resignations on the rise, this is the time to build a pipeline with the next generation. Programs like the one at Arizona State University offer a model&hellip;",

    "content": "SPOILER ALERT: This contains spoilers for Season 4 of HBO’s Succession. The latest season of HBO’s Succession centers around two ground shifting events—the death of family patriarch and global media titan Logan Roy, and a U.S. presidential election. Perhaps unwittingly, the show’s writers put a spotlight on an ongoing vulnerability in our system for electing the president: the still unfinished work of Electoral Count Act reform. The election subplot plays on the worst fears of our recent political history—razor thin election margins, existential fear of the other party’s candidate, exit polling head fakes, accusations of voting irregularities, ANTIFA protests, and violent threats against election workers. The fictional ATN (American Television Network) familiarly tells us it could be “the most important election in our lifetime.” On Election Day, there is a fire at a ballot tabulation center in one of the two decisive states. Potentially 100,000 ballots may have been destroyed—most of them likely for the Democrat. Accusations fly. Democrats suspect the Republican candidate’s supporters of starting the fire. Republicans claim it was an ANTIFA false flag attack. Some reports speculate the cause was electrical failure. Siobhan Roy, whose interests lie with the Democratic candidate, insists the Wisconsin results can’t be certified and there would have to be a revote. Her brother, Roman, whose interests lie with the Republican, maintains that the ballots are lost, the mess could never be sorted out, and the network should call the state for the Republican. The network’s chief election analyst advises “there’s nothing in Wisconsin law that really covers what to do.” This is indeed a nightmare scenario. With the 2020 election and its aftermath not far behind us, viewers would be right to wonder whether the U.S. is prepared for such a scenario. Emergencies and other disruptions to routine voting are not new. Hurricanes, forest fires, tornadoes, power failures, flooding, protests, and even terrorist attacks have impacted our election process. Be assured, state and local election officials have in place a variety of emergency and continuity of operations plans meant to allow voting to continue even under the worst of unforeseen circumstances. Any widespread loss of cast ballots would likely spur extensive litigation, with the courts deciding the ultimate remedy before a state certified its results. The Succession scenario still has interrogatory value. Federal law requires that presidential electors be selected on Election Day, potentially limiting the breadth and efficacy of any remedies. Another lesson from 2020, attempts to accommodate voters in difficult circumstances can be used to question the legitimacy of a state’s results when they reach Congress. To that end, late in 2022, Congress enacted bipartisan reforms to shore up many of the vulnerabilities in the Electoral Count Act, the law that governs the process for counting Electoral College ballots. Unfortunately, states may not be able to avail themselves of new provisions that might shepherd them through such a disaster. Among the many reforms passed in 2022 was an attempt to fix the so-called “failed election” provision. Previously, this vague section&hellip;",

    "content": "Our seedling supply chain is not able to meet the high demand for reforestation. America&#8217;s forests are an important natural and economic resource that maintain and enhance biodiversity, connect people to the land, support recreational economies, promote a thriving forestry workforce, and cost-effectively sequester carbon dioxide. Reforestation is an important part of rebuilding forested land after timber harvests or disturbances like invasive species or wildfires, yet the infrastructure and workforce needed to rebuild and sustain healthy forests have diminished over the last several years. What’s more, reforestation efforts can no longer rely as heavily as they once did on natural regeneration due to degraded soil, lack of water, and reduced sapling survival. “Today, we’re unable to respond to urgent reforestation needs and opportunities. Put simply, there are not enough seeds, people to collect them, or nurseries to grow them. We need to revitalize our reforestation supply chain by growing seed and seedling supply faster, developing new infrastructure for seed collection and safe storage, expand and enhance our tree nurseries, and update how we recruit and train a dramatically expanded workforce,” said Jad Daley, President and CEO of American Forests and member of the BPC Farm and Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force. Trees are typically transplanted from nurseries to forests as seedlings, the delicate stage after a seed sprouts and has begun growing above the soil. The U.S. needs to more than double its seedling production to reforest the 133 million acres of land that has historically been forested. Three major barriers to a robust U.S. seedling production supply chain: Declines in workforce over the last several years. The work is seasonal and highly specialized for all parts of the seedling supply chain, including seed collection, processing, and storage, and nursery management. For example, a seed collector typically must be a trained arborist, able to climb trees, and well-versed in the ecology of the region. In fact, workforce shortages are frequently cited as the biggest challenge facing the seedling supply chain and reforestation efforts broadly. “Like most industries, private nursery owners and state nursery managers rely on a highly trained workforce, which they have seen diminish over time. The seasonal nature of this work also makes it challenging to compete with other employers in the region who can offer year-round work,” said Bob Izlar, Founding Director (Retired) of the University of Georgia Langdale Center for Forest Business and member of the BPC Farm and Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force. Lack of long-term financial certainty for nurseries. Nursery infrastructure includes greenhouse space for container growing, land for seedbeds, storage, processing, and administrative spaces. It can take up to 2 years to prepare newly purchased land to begin growing seedlings, and then another 1-2 years before seedlings are ready for sale, but many nurseries lack predictable long-term financing or dedicated public funding for that amount of time. Additionally, nurseries need long-term market demand signals before investing in land to expand or make needed infrastructure improvements. Nursery infrastructure across much of the nation has&hellip;",

Compared to our surveys in September 2021 and September 2022, experiences with eviction, mortgage forbearance, and foreclosure all ticked up: Nearly one-in-twelve (8%) of respondents received an eviction notice over the past three months, up from one-in-twenty (5%) in 2021 and 2022. 7% entered mortgage forbearance over the past three months, up from 4% in 2021 and 2022. 6% entered or completed the foreclosure process in the past three months, up from 3% in 2021 and 2022. 38% of respondents in the latest survey reported an increase in rent, mortgage, or utility payments, down from 54% in 2022. Difficulty making mortgage payments remained consistent with our previous surveys while difficulty paying rent declined slightly. 30% said it was somewhat or very difficult to pay their monthly mortgage payment compared to 29% in both 2021 and 2022. 41% said it was somewhat or very difficult to pay their monthly rent, compared to 49% in 2021 and 52% in 2022. Americans across the political spectrum see our country’s inadequate supply of housing as a problem and a driver of high housing costs—and want Congress to act. Three-in-four adults (74%) said the lack of an adequate supply of affordable homes is a problem in the United States. Three-in-four adults (75%) also think inadequate housing supply contributes to high housing costs. A bipartisan majority of adults (75%) think passing bipartisan legislation to increase the supply of affordable homes and help address high housing costs should be a priority for Congress this year, including 83% of Democrats, 71% of independents, and 68% of Republicans). More than half of Millennial respondents (51%) &#8211; born between 1981 and 1996 &#8211; said passing legislation to increase the supply of housing and address high housing costs should be a top priority for Congress—which is the highest of all age groups surveyed.

With many years of innovation in this area, this program has potential for greater impact as a national decarbonization strategy and rural economic development driver. Here we summarize the status of the Biobased Products Program and offer six recommendations to modernize it, multiply its impact and provide increased economic and climate benefits in the future. Background: Biobased Products Program Biobased products and materials are those derived from biomass, which includes organic waste and agricultural and forestry residues, etc. The Biobased Products program, also known as the BioPreferred or Biobased Markets Program, is designed to create jobs and generate economic benefits in rural America by enhancing adoption of biobased products. Created in the 2002 Farm Bill under the Energy Title, the program includes a federal purchasing requirement and a voluntary labeling initiative. The former is a requirement wherein federal agencies and their contractors are required to purchase biobased products from a list of product categories with minimum biobased content. The voluntary labeling initiative provides biobased labeling for biobased commodities in the private sector—for example, commercially-available laundry detergent with a “USDA Certified Biobased Product” label. Economic and climate benefits of biomass and biomass-derived products While the BioPreferred Program has seen success, U.S. biomass resources are underutilized despite their promise. In tandem with policies to support sustainable practices that reduce fertilizer and water use, increase soil carbon, and avoid land use and conversion impacts, biomass can provide vital benefits. Displacing petroleum derived-products with biomass-derived products (like biochemicals, bioplastics, and agriculture and forestry products) can contribute to notable emissions reductions. According to estimates from 2016, U.S. biobased products contributed to approximately 13 million metric tons of CO2e in avoided emissions and over $459 billion and 5 million jobs to the U.S. economy. Beyond biobased products, biomass can generate low-carbon and carbon-negative energy (e.g. hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, biofuels, and bioelectricity) and offer solutions for carbon storage through biochar, bio-oil, and carbon captured for removal. Clean technology startups such as Charm and Mote are using biomass from agricultural waste for long-term carbon sequestration. Biomass currently constitutes 5% of all U.S. primary energy consumption. A Bipartisan Policy Center(BPC) co-led analysis, Decarb America, underscored the critical role of biomass in the clean energy transition and the potential for more than 500,000 biomass-related jobs in a future net-zero carbon emissions U.S. economy in 2050. Through biomass, there is a unique opportunity to derive direct economic benefits from climate smart practices and products. By capitalizing on local biomass resources, a biobased economy can catalyze a host of complementary benefits including: promoting a circular economy; providing additional revenue for growers and landowners; supporting diversified, localized, and small business production of biobased goods; and enabling a more resilient regional economic activity free from global geopolitical dynamics. Expanding the BioPreferred Program’s benefits The BioPreferred Program showcases some of these economic benefits of biomass. The&hellip;",

Our first stop was the Jayhawk Club in Lawrence, Kansas, where the Dole Institute of Politics hosted a reception and dinner in honor of Senators Tom Daschle and Trent Lott. BPC Senior Vice President Bill Hoagland spoke about the importance of bipartisanship. Following a quick ride to the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, the audience gathered for the Dole Lecture, a discussion each spring that commemorates when Bob Dole was wounded during World War II. Normally held in Washington, DC, this was the first lecture to be outside the nation’s capital and, appropriately, in its namesake’s home state. Sens. Daschle and Lott talked about their time in the Senate, the need for bipartisanship, and how they’ve seen the Senate change since their time in office. The full discussion can be found at c-span.org. The next day, the health team visited the newly opened Treatment and Recovery Center of Douglas County. Residents can receive 24/7 immediate help for their psychiatric, substance abuse, or other mental health issues at the center. We toured the facility and learned more about how they’ll be able to provide direct crisis care and connect individuals to community resources, including on-site transitional housing, and a broad recovery network. While their doors have only been open a few weeks, it was clear what a valuable resource the center will be for Douglas County’s 119,000 residents. At the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, directly across the street from the Treatment and Recovery Center, members of the BPC team joined other invitees to hear from seven interdisciplinary city and county leaders about how they worked together to not only make the center a reality, but also move Douglas County’s behavioral health care in a new direction. It was inspiring to learn more about Douglas County’s whole-community approach to the issue—it also gave BPC staff a lot of ideas for future projects!  From left to right: Patrick Kelly, Douglas County Commission; Chief Rich Lockhart, Lawrence Kansas Police Dept.; Patrick Schmitz, Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center; Judge Mark Simpson, District Court of Douglas County; Dr. Nana Dadson, Bert Nash Community Mental Health System; Anthony Lewis, Lawrence Public Schools; Shannon Oury, Lawrence-Douglas County Housing Authority Our next and final stop was the state capital and home of the Sunflower Foundation, Topeka. Situated on what was formerly the Menninger Foundation—including a clinic, sanatorium, and school of psychiatry—the Sunflower Foundation is a statewide health philanthropy and regular partner of BPC’s health work.

    "content": "The Supreme Court’s recent Dobbs decision is leading many child care experts to expect an increase in some state’s birthrates, and thus, increasing the number of children who will need child care. Our nation’s current child care system is already strained and cannot meet the current demand. A quarter of women go back to work less than two weeks after giving birth. And with few child care providers offering care for infants under six weeks old, how are working families coping? Where will these infants get child care? What is the impact of returning to work so soon on infant bonding and child development? To answer these questions, the Bipartisan Policy Center sat down with Dr. Walter Gilliam to discuss the science behind infant bonding and the need for policies to support it. Dr. Gilliam is a leading expert on child development and education and was recently named the executive director of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska. Gilliam was a Professor of Child Psychiatry and Psychology at Yale University School of Medicine and the Director of the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy. He is a widely published and cited researcher, author, and speaker with expertise in early childhood care and education programs, school readiness, and mental health supports for young children, among other areas. The Science Behind Infant Bonding Relationships between babies and their parents are crucial to child development. Developments in neuroscience suggest that the hormone Oxytocin is a key to infant bonding. When babies are born, mothers experience a surge of oxytocin, which jumpstarts the “drive to cuddle” and care for the baby, says Dr. Gilliam. This surge also occurs in fathers who were present for the birth. Dr. Gilliam notes that “Babies are wired to seek out important adults in their life”, with newborns seeking out their mother’s face and scent. During birth, the brains of parents are rewired to reciprocate. For foster parents, adoptive parents, and other guardians, Oxytocin promotes caregiving behavior and bonding. But current policies make it difficult for parents to spend time with their infants and form these bonds. Our policies run counter to basic human biology. What Happens When Parents Return to Work? This science has not reached the public or policymakers, Linda Smith, Director of BPC’s Early Childhood Initiative points out. Dr. Gilliam says, “So often we know what we should do, but we choose to do something else.” Without paid maternal or paternal leave programs, low-income women and families have few options but to return to work soon after birth, limiting potential bonding time. “Clearly, a couple of weeks is not enough time” says Gilliam. Finding a child care program that accepts infants under six weeks old is exceedingly rare. So, when parents must return to work shortly after birth and child care centers are not an option, infants are often “bounced around” between caretakers, which Gilliam equates to “care homelessness.” This inhibits infants from forming essential bonds with their caretaker.&hellip;",

    "content": "Accelerating our permitting process for clean energy and other infrastructure projects is critical to lowering emissions, reducing energy costs, increasing energy reliability, and enhancing both our energy and supply chain security. At the same time, robust public engagement with local communities is crucial to ensure transparency and provide timely, comprehensive, and understandable information to those who are potentially impacted. An effective process will help to foster a trusted environment that in turn enhances the opportunity to develop “buy-in” and even potential partnerships. A fulsome and transparent community process will also result in better final project planning and reduce potential opposition In April 2023, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a private workshop that brought together experts from across the political spectrum to explore the pros and cons of specific reforms to improve public engagement and increase the efficiency of the permitting process. The goal of the workshop was not to identify a set of consensus recommendations. Rather, it was to solicit feedback on a menu of policy options. There was one point of consensus: community engagement reforms must be included in any politically viable legislative permitting reform package. The workshop explored a set of specific policy options that were considered by participants, with a significant amount of the discussion focused on third-party involvement. Option 1: Establish and fund non-biased third parties to perform community education and engagement on energy technologies (not projects) Because the onus for community engagement activities currently falls on project sponsors, it is natural for local communities to have at least some level of apprehension, even distrust, with developers who have a profit motive associated with the project. Workshop participants discussed having a third-party entity perform community engagement on technology types, rather than specific projects, to educate the community on the specifics of the technology, infrastructure needs, science, likely generic local impacts, and safety considerations. Funding a non-biased third-party with technology expertise to perform upfront community engagement and technical education could unlock early project efficiency gains. Utilizing an organization with repeated experience and expertise in the technology and process should give local communities a trusted resource and partner while serving to reduce delays associated with the permitting process. Participants noted that information sharing could be reciprocal, with the third-party gaining knowledge on community concerns so they can be addressed in project planning and environmental reviews. Participants discussed whether the use of a third-party should be optional or mandatory. A mandatory approach would create a new baseline for community engagement but would, unfortunately, add to the already cumbersome permitting process. For that reason, most participants preferred not requiring this step for specific projects, but rather developing the capacity to provide this service for large projects where it may be more useful. Some participants argued that the third-party approach may help educate communities, but would not solve the issue of disadvantaged stakeholders having neither the time or resources to engage in the process. This was acknowledged and BPC moderators reiterated that these policy options are not mutually exclusive—no single option&hellip;",

    "content": "Population growth spurs increased consumer demand, stimulates investment, and generates ideas that accelerate innovation, but the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) Demographic Outlook: 2023 to 2053 forecasts that population growth will become ever more dependent on immigration as the U.S. population ages. CBO forecasts show that U.S. deaths will exceed births in 2042 as a result of an aging population. If we are to continue to see sustained economic growth and ensure a sufficient tax base to support those dependent on federal benefits into the future, policymakers must authorize greater levels of immigration. Immigration is needed to drive population growth The CBO nicely summarizes its population forecast in a graphic, reproduced below as Figure 1. The number of births, the number of deaths, and net immigration together determine population growth. The forecast shows population growth of only 0.3% per year, on average, over the next 30 years. This is roughly one-third of the growth rate over the last 40 years (0.8%). Figure 1: Population Growth and Its Underlying Factors An aging U.S. population is the primary cause of the growth slowdown. The CBO’s forecast shows that the size of the population aged 65 or older is set to increase relative to the prime working age population (ages 25 to 64), from 34% of the prime age population in 2023 to 46% in 2053. The increase in the older population is relevant to overall population growth for two main reasons: 1) those over 65 are less likely to have children than those who are younger, and 2) they are also more likely to die. The more people in the overall population that are in this older age bracket, the fewer new births and the greater annual deaths are likely. For this reason, an aging population contributes to population stagnation or even decline. Indeed, while births exceeding deaths currently explains 0.1% of the 0.5% increase in the U.S. population year over year, the CBO’s analysis shows that, by 2042, the aging of the population results in deaths exceeding births. Population growth after that point is driven entirely by immigration. The CBO expects net immigration to initially rise as the effects of the pandemic wane and economic conditions improve, before ultimately stabilizing. Overall, they project annual net immigration to the U.S. to average 1.1 million people per year over the 2023-2053 period, roughly in line with the post-recession and pre-pandemic period between 2010-2019 (average of 1.0 million people per year). Ultimately, as shown in Figure 1, the forecasted level of immigration isn’t sufficient to prevent a slowing of the population growth rate. The greater number of deaths than births reduces the population growth rate from 0.3% to 0.2% year over year by 2051. Immigration is vital for the economy and to support an aging population Population growth is an important driver of economic growth, making the prospect of population decline highly concerning. Some recent economic research has even argued that living standards might stagnate entirely in the absence of population growth. For this reason,&hellip;",

The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. You can read the first two blogs in our series on congressional support for reauthorization here and here.  Small businesses are impacted by a range of public policy issues. Many of them, including access to capital, government contracting, and business support services, can be addressed by modernizing the Small Business Administration (SBA) through congressional reauthorization. Others, however, lie outside the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Small Business Committees. During National Small Business Week, BPC highlighted several of the pressing issues confronting entrepreneurs and small business owners, which we recap here. Tightening Lending Market Starting and growing a business takes money and one of the primary ways in which small businesses finance their operations is through external credit. There are multiple signs that the credit market continues to tighten. The January release of the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices showed that, in the last few months of 2022, banks were pulling back on business lending and reporting lower demand for loans from small businesses. With high interest rates and the recent turmoil in the banking sector following the collapse of several large banks this year, further tightening in credit for small businesses is expected. In fact, small business owners are already saying this. In a recent survey of small business owners, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices reports that three-quarters of small business owners are concerned about their ability to access capital. That’s much different than a year ago, when the same proportion of small business owners reported being confident in their ability to access capital. Small business lending is also a hot topic inside the Beltway. Members of Congress have expressed concern about the recently finalized SBA lending rules, including one that opens the 7(a) program to new lenders. The Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee held a hearing on the rules in April and the House Small Business Committee is scheduled to hold two hearings on the topic this month, which we’ll cover later in the “Road to Reauthorization” series. Finding and Providing Child Care A lack of access to affordable child care is a barrier to starting a business. It also impairs small business hiring and makes retaining employees more difficult. Last year, BPC surveyed working mothers and found that, among those interested in starting a business, 44% said access to affordable child care was a barrier. The barrier is even more formidable for working mothers with children under 5 years old. Small business owners with children face the dual challenge of finding and affording child care for their kids and the children of their employees. Eighty percent of small business owners believe access to child care is a barrier to workforce participation,&hellip;",

    "content": "Over the past several years, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Food and Nutrition Security Task Force, a group of 18 public and private sector leaders, identified legislative and policy opportunities to improve food and nutrition security in the United States. Under the direction of four co-chairs—former Agriculture Secretaries Dan Glickman and Ann Veneman, chef and founder of World Central Kitchen José Andrés, and FMI – The Food Industry Association President and CEO Leslie Sarasin—the task force produced a series of reports, including a 2022 policy brief, Strengthening the Child Nutrition Program, and a January 2023 report, Making Food and Nutrition Security a SNAP: Recommendations for the 2023 Farm Bill. The child nutrition report recommended, among other things, that the Department of Agriculture (USDA): maintain and, if possible, strengthen nutrition standards for all foods and beverages provided through the child nutrition programs to better align them with the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Mathematics (NASEM) recommendations; modernize the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program by relaxing physical-presence rules; and provide school meals to all students at no cost, also known as universal school meals, which may include incremental steps such as lowering the threshold for the community eligibility provision (CEP) and increasing the federal reimbursement multiplier. In the farm bill report, the task force recommended that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) benefits should be allowed to be used to cover online shopping transaction, delivery, monthly membership, or other fees up to a certain limit, such as $10 per month per SNAP participant. The USDA recently proposed a series of rules that would address some of the task force recommendations, including proposed rules to modernize the WIC program, lower the CEP for school lunches, and two rules to better align the DGA within the school lunch and WIC programs. In response, task force co-chairs Glickman and Veneman submitted letters to the Federal Register highlighting overall support for those rules. WIC Modernization The co-chairs noted their support for various USDA proposals related to the physical presence rules, as well as the use of WIC funds to cover some or all online shopping-related fees, given the similarities of the USDA proposal to a SNAP-related task force recommendation. Lower CEP The co-chairs wrote in support of the USDA proposed rule to lower the CEP from 40% to 25%, and encouraged the USDA to work with Congress to increase the federal reimbursement multiplier to make it more financially feasible for schools to provide free school lunches. Align DGA/NASEM in Childhood Nutrition Programs Not only did the co-chairs comment on the value of better aligning the DGA within the school nutrition programs, but they also noted specific support for establishing nutrition standards for added sugars and updating the school meal standards for sodium, whole grains, and milk, along with a multi-year phase in of the updated standards. In February 2023, the co-chairs commented on the USDA’s proposed revisions to the WIC food&hellip;",

    "content": "On both sides of the aisle, stakeholders are debating the Commerce Department’s recent announcement that companies seeking CHIPS Act funding will be asked to include a plan for employee child care in their application. Largely left out of these debates are the millions of working parents already struggling to find and afford child care. Depending on its implementation, the CHIPS child care guidance has the potential to increase pressure on an already constrained child care market. Unless investments are also made to expand supply, adding more demand risks displacing children already enrolled and making it harder for working parents to find care. CHIPS Child Care Guidance The overarching goal of the CHIPS Act is to boost America’s economic competitiveness by increasing domestic production of microprocessors to reduce reliance on the overseas supply chain—not tackling the child care crisis. Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo explained that asking companies to develop child care plans aims to speed up projects amid a worker shortage. The Department’s top priority remains rapidly scaling up semiconductor factory investments. &nbsp; CHIPS Guidance on How to Provide Access to Child Care  On-Site Care: Operated by the Employer  On-Site Care: Contractor Operated  Off-Site Care: Cash Assistance  Off-Site Care: Provider Sponsorship  The CHIPS Workforce Development Planning Guide outlines the types of child care investments available for companies. Some options, such as building on-site care, could help expand child care supply by creating new slots for their employee’s children. Other options, including cash assistance and provider sponsorship, focuses on helping employees afford child care without creating new slots. Given the pressure to scale up projects quickly, companies seem likely to choose the latter option since building on-site care takes time and more up-front resources. The Risk: Amidst Our Existing Child Care Shortage, Companies with Deep Pockets Could Out-Compete Parents Companies expected to receive federal subsidies to expand domestic manufacturing facilities, like TSMC and Samsung, have significant market power in the advanced chip industry. To quickly meet the child care requirement, companies could contract with existing off-site providers near the new fabrication plants. These multi-billion-dollar companies could also likely afford to offer above-market tuition rates to existing providers or provide substantial cash assistance directly to employees to seek care. Since neither option inherently creates new child care capacity, chips manufacturing employees will be competing for the same slots as other parents living and working in the community. However well-intentioned the policy of requiring companies to provide child care as a condition of receiving CHIPS Act funding, the unintended consequence could be to crowd-out those parents that currently have and need child care services. Child care providers themselves are small business owners in a fragile market. Three-fourths of child care centers and almost all home-based providers are for-profit. Providers operate on razor thin margins and low wages. About one in three providers are considering shutting down, and more than half (53%) of providers are enrolled in at least one main public benefit program. These providers, mostly women and minorities, would likely benefit from&hellip;",

    "content": "As the first blog in this series explained, the term “face recognition technologies” refers to both face verification (1:1 comparison) and face identification (1:N comparison) technologies. These technologies are distinct from face detection and face analysis technologies. How do different types of face recognition technologies work? And how do users in the public and private sectors deploy them? This second blog in the series on face recognition technology governance challenges will address those questions and explain why distinguishing between functional applications and use cases can support efforts to advance face recognition technology legislation. Five Key Face Recognition Technology Governance Challenges: 1. Many terms and definitions 2. Many functional applications 3. Many use cases 4. Many ways to assess technical accuracy and performance 5. Many sociotechnical risks and benefits that differ depending on the accuracy and performance of the technology, functional application, and use case. Challenge 2: Many Functional Applications In many still image face recognition technology applications, a camera takes a photograph that face recognition technologies use to generate a “probe” face template. The face recognition technologies then compare the probe template to one (in the case of face verification) or several (in the case of face identification) face template(s) in a gallery. Outputs vary depending on the face recognition system’s design. If the probe template is similar enough to a gallery template to clear a preset threshold, some face recognition systems simply indicate that the probe template represents someone in the gallery. For example, the system could convey that the probe template represents an authorized individual by unlocking a device, displaying a check mark, or opening a gate. Other face recognition systems return the information stored with the gallery template (such as the individual’s name and/or photograph) that is most similar to the probe template and that clears a preset threshold. These systems convey which specific individual in the gallery the probe template represents, not just that the probe template represents someone in the gallery. The face identification systems that many in law enforcement use to help generate investigative leads compare the probe template from a still image to a gallery of face templates and return a preset number of results (often called a “ranked candidate list”). These ranked candidate lists consist of the information stored with the gallery templates that were most similar to the probe template and a percentage score measuring the similarity between the probe template and each gallery template. For example, a law enforcement agency may configure a face recognition system to produce a ranked candidate list of ten entries. This system would use a probe template from a photograph to query a face template gallery and return a list of the ten names and photographs (along with similarity scores) associated with the gallery templates that were most similar to the probe template. Real-time video face recognition technology applications work similarly, except that, instead of generating a probe face template from a still image, they generate one or more probe templates from faces detected in&hellip;",

    "content": "This blog is part of our “Road to Reauthorization” blog series, that builds off BPC’s latest small business report, Small Agency, Big Mandate: A Bipartisan Road Map to Modernizing SBA. The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. You can read the first blog in our series on congressional support for reauthorization here. There is a lot to celebrate during National Small Business Week this year—not least of which is the grit, ambition, and optimism that characterize the American entrepreneurial spirit. Entrepreneurship is responsible for nearly all net new job creation in the U.S. economy. To fully appreciate this phenomenon, consider how different the small business landscape looks today than it did three years ago at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between February 2020 and April 2020, the number of active business owners in the United States fell by 3.3 million, the largest drop on record. Black business owners were especially hard hit, with a 41% drop in business activity during this time. As small businesses shut their doors, millions of Americans also lost their ability to earn wages. Unemployment jumped to 14.7% in April 2020 and was still at a pre-pandemic high of 7.9% in September 2020, when National Small Business Week was held that year. Things look much brighter today than those dark spring days three years ago, with Americans starting new businesses at record rates and unemployment back to its January 2020 low of 3.5%. From 2020 through 2022, the number of new business applications filed with the IRS rose to an annual average of 4.9 million—a 78% increase from the annual average of 2.8 million new businesses created between 2005 and 2019. As we celebrate these entrepreneurs, it is also important to recognize those that provide guidance and help to small business owners. Entrepreneurs and small business owners are supported by a robust ecosystem of service providers and programs, whose assistance and coaching helps them overcome many barriers new and small businesses encounter. The Small Business Administration’s (SBA) entrepreneurial development programs, including Small Business Development Centers, Women’s Business Centers, and SCORE, comprise vital parts of this ecosystem. And while celebration is certainly in order during National Small Business Week, any true appreciation for entrepreneurs and small business owners should also spark a desire to help—and help is needed. Small business owners continue to face challenges posed by inflation and hiring qualified workers, not to mention long-standing issues like those related to accessing capital and navigating red tape. Encouragingly, there are signs that Congress is committed to helping, as bipartisan interest in SBA reauthorization is growing. What better way for policymakers to show their appreciation for entrepreneurs and small business owners than by matching their drive and innovative sprit in pursuit of a top-to-bottom modernization of the federal agency meant to “aid, counsel, assist, and protect” small businesses? National Small Business Week also offers a chance to consider areas of public policy beyond the purview of&hellip;",

    "content": "The United States must adopt a comprehensive approach to prepare the workforce for the transition to an AI-driven economy. The impacts of AI on the workforce are unpredictable. Many are concerned about significant workplace disruption and displacement. In the face of rapid change and uncertainty, it&#8217;s crucial to build workforce resilience and adaptability. Success can lead to a more productive and innovative workforce, but failure poses risks to American competitiveness and workers. The New AI Landscape AI technology is transforming many sectors of the economy. One survey found that organizations adopting AI more than doubled between 2017 and 2022. The same survey also showed that an organization&#8217;s number of AI capabilities, such as robotics, natural language processing, or recommendation systems, has doubled over the same period. Businesses recognize the value of AI in their operations, but impacts differ across industries due to the distinct utilization of various AI capabilities and applications. For instance, the retail sector uses chatbots to improve customer experiences and satisfaction. At the same time, the health care industry has made significant use of computer vision and biometric-related AI tools to analyze data for more effective treatments. The diverse applications of AI imply that each industry will experience unique effects. Today, we&#8217;re witnessing the emergence of novel developments and increased access to generative AI models that learn from vast amounts of data to create content that can seem indistinguishable from human output. Writing tools such as ChatGPT and Bard and image generators such as Stable Diffusion and Dall-E were introduced to the public in just the last year. We have only begun to scratch the surface of the impact these technologies will have on society. Impact of AI Technology on the Workforce The introduction of new AI technology raises important questions about their impacts on the workforce and job disruption. Despite the complexity and unpredictability of AI&#8217;s impact on jobs, some studies have still tried to quantify these effects. For instance, one research paper projects that &#8220;roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and that generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work,&#8221; but notes &#8220;worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs.&#8221; Another research paper on AI language modeling capability finds that the &#8220;top occupations exposed to language modeling include telemarketers and a variety of post-secondary teachers&#8221; and that the &#8220;top industries exposed to advances in language modeling are legal services and securities, commodities, and investments.&#8221; Given the high uncertainty around these issues, these papers are highly speculative. If history is a guide, often it is individual tasks within jobs that are most susceptible to being automated. The difference between jobs and tasks is an important distinction when looking at how emerging technologies will affect the workforce. AI is often more effective at automating individual actions or steps within a job rather than automating the job entirely. AI is often also effective in complementing other parts of a job. For instance, an AI&hellip;",

    "content": "It is said that “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” In the case of Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-CA) request to temporarily step down from the Judiciary Committee, there appears to be no historic analog. But as Roll Call’s Niels Lesniewski recently reported, there are noteworthy instances where senators attempted to resign from committee. Investigating those events further may surface lessons that can guide the Senate through the stormy present. As Roll Call reports, Riddick’s Senate Procedure, a compilation of the rules and precedents of the chamber, cites three cases where senators requested to step down from committee assignments: Huey P. Long of Louisiana during the 72nd Congress, Wayne Morse of Oregon during the 79th Congress, and John T. Morgan during the 51st Congress (1889-1891). In one case, the resignation was accepted. In the two other cases, the requests were not effectuated. The circumstances of each of these three cases provide more insight than the outcomes alone. None of the cases involved a temporary replacement; neither were any of the circumstances predicated by infirmity or an inability to perform committee duties. It is worth noting that, like today, these incidents came amidst intense controversy in the chamber. Senators looking to these historical occurrences would have to stretch to apply them today, but they should consider how the passionate, and at times indecorous, behavior involved affected institutional comity. Resignation Accepted: Senator Huey P. Long (D-LA) On April 29, 1932, Sen. Huey P. Long submitted a resolution stating that he wished to, “…hereby resign as a member of the Committees on Naval Affairs, Manufactures, Commerce, and Interoceanic Canals.” Days later, the vice president announced that without objection Long would, “…be excused from further attendance upon the committees named.” Long’s resignation was not out of an inability to carry out committee responsibilities, like Feinstein, or a wish to serve on other committees. Rather, Long resigned in protest of his own party’s political positions. Early on the day of his resignation, Long sparred on the floor with his Democratic colleagues, specifically Majority Leader Joseph T. Robinson (D-AR), over Long’s support for a bill to cap annual individual income at one million dollars per year. In what the New York Times then described as a “verbal duel,” Robinson suggested Long was angling to take over Democratic leadership. Long later explicitly called for such a change. The incident was called “dramatic” and a “comic opera.” Long said that, in politics, when one “had to go another way” from one’s party, one is expected to “surrender whatever the organization gave him.” Long was summarily replaced on his committees by other Democrats. He continued to serve in the Senate and, in the next Congress, it appears he took no committee assignments during the organization of the chamber. Resignation Declined: John T. Morgan (D-AL) Nearly 40 years before the Long incident, Sen. John T. Morgan requested to be excused from further service on the Committee on Foreign Relations, of which he was then the ranking&hellip;",

    "content": "While the opioid crisis began in the 1990s, the efforts to combat it continue almost three decades later. The crisis has and continues to change: What started with overprescribing and a death toll of 20,000 in the early 2000s has morphed into a battle against illicit fentanyl and over 100,000 lives lost each year. Earlier this month, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) announced the designation of fentanyl mixed xylazine as an emerging threat, the first use of the emerging threat designation authority since its passage by Congress in 2018. The changing landscape of the opioid crisis does not stop there. In 2023, it’s not just new drugs that need to be considered in the opioid crisis but also the mode of treatment. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 85% of patients with substance use disorder were not receiving care. COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns drastically changed care delivery, including treatment for those with opioid use disorder (OUD), moving treatment from mostly in-office visits to virtual check-ins with health care providers. Initial data from the pandemic indicate that access to virtual treatment reduced the risk of overdose death by 33%. As evidence continues to emerge, policymakers and agencies need to consider how access to virtual behavioral health care will play into the fight against opioids, including impacting people’s access to care and health outcomes. Given BPC’s vast work in behavioral health and telehealth policy, members of our Health Program recently responded to two Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) proposed rules involving telemedicine. Expansion of induction of buprenorphine via telemedicine encounter (RIN 1117-AB78) Our recommendations include: Extension of the current teleprescribing flexibilities through December 31, 2024, under the opioid crisis public health emergency Formal evaluation of the impacts of teleprescribing flexibilities on public health and safety Development of special registration authorized in Ryan Haight Act of 2008 Expanded prescribing training for eligible providers Full comments available online. Telemedicine prescribing of controlled substances when the practitioner and the patient have not had a prior in-person medical evaluation (RIN 1117-AB40) Our recommendations include: Leveraging virtual check-ins as an alternative to in-person visits when appropriate Requiring that non-cancer, non-hospice patients have at least one medical evaluation before a prescription is issued Use data from proposed labeling requirement to develop a special registration Full comments available online. BPC’s Health Program comments on tele-prescribing of controlled substances as well as our recent input on ONDCP’s 2024 National Drug Control Strategy help regulators develop research-driven, bipartisan policies that ensure safe and accessible patient care.",

    "content": "The failure of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and Signature Bank raised concerns about a larger financial crisis, as well as potential spillover effects in the housing market. On March 30, the Terwilliger Center Twitter Space conversation with Center Executive Director Dennis Shea and two prominent economists: Mark Calabria, senior advisor at the Cato Institute and former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution. A transcript of the event is available here. Both economists were confident the current instability in the banking sector is different from the circumstances that led to the 2008 financial crisis. “We’re in a different economic environment than we were in September 2008,” Calabria explained, referencing the economy’s strong job growth. Calabria described the three recently failed banks as uniquely troubled outliers. Klein concurred, adding that Signature and Silvergate were unusually exposed to fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, while Signature had a large unhedged portfolio. However, both Klein and Calabria warned a mortgage credit contraction may be on the horizon. “I think…we’re going to see more regulatory scrutiny of regionals, and even some larger community banks,” Calabria said. He foresaw credit restrictions for multifamily construction loans and some individual mortgage loans tightening. Klein agreed there will likely be a credit contraction, but his concern was that depositors will move money out of the banking system into money-market mutual funds, “tilting the playing field of credit away from small businesses, away from consumers, and to government and large businesses.” Calabria and Klein decried the Federal Reserve’s lack of proper oversight over Silicon Valley Bank. Klein described regulators as “completely asleep at the switch,” and said there were “deep structural problems” at the San Francisco Federal Reserve, where the CEO of SVB was a board member. But Calabria was wary of the need for federal intervention at this stage. He described himself as “very skeptical that was a systemically important institution.” He continued stating, “Ultimately, what we need to have is a system where an institution like Silicon Valley Bank can go down without a problem.” Calabria was pessimistic about the possibility of legislative reform in a divided Congress. He said any new legislation would most likely increase the deposit insurance limit, which worried him. Without uninsured depositors pushing to close failing banks, he said, regulators may move too slowly. Klein noted the Biden administration did call for legislation to increase claw backs and penalties, but agreed that raising the deposit insurance cap would be a mistake. “98% of Americans are already covered,” he said. “As a proud progressive…FDR was only interested in protecting the ordinary American family here, not corporations.” You can follow Dennis Shea, Mark Calabria, Aaron Klein, and the Bipartisan Policy Center on Twitter, or visit bipartisanpolicy.org for the latest updates on the Terwilliger Center.

    "content": "The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides many workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected family and medical leave annually. However, current law leaves over 40% of workers ineligible for job protection and poses unnecessary compliance challenges to employers. More than three decades after becoming law, FMLA is overdue for modernization to both ease burdens on employers and expand coverage for workers. Job protection plays a pivotal role in supporting the nation’s economic strength by keeping workers connected to the labor force while they take needed time away from their jobs. Although FMLA has been in effect for over 30 years, there have been few successful congressional attempts to improve the law. The Bipartisan Policy Center recommends the following reforms to modernize FMLA to better meet the needs of employers and employees. Recommendations to Benefit Employers Increase the shortest increment of time employees are required to take for unplanned intermittent leave. Currently, FMLA allows workers to take unplanned intermittent leave in increments as short as one-tenth of an hour. Congress should increase the minimum required amount of time for intermittent leave to two hours when the leave is unplanned, or the employee does not provide sufficient notice. eliminating the need for employers to track periods of leave to the minute, and reduce abuses of FMLA. Allow employee transfers in instances of unplanned intermittent leave. While employers can temporarily transfer employees taking planned intermittent leave to an alternative position, current law does not allow such a transfer when the leave is unplanned. Introducing this option for unplanned intermittent leave would provide employers with greater flexibility. Adjust the definition of Serious Health Condition (SHC). Under the current definition, many workers receive FMLA protections for health conditions that are not serious in nature, resulting in workers taking unplanned intermittent leave for temporary illnesses such as the common cold. Ensuring that FMLA is reserved for workers with serious conditions would reduce instances of unplanned intermittent leave and target job protection to workers who need it most. Require employees to provide notice prior to foreseeable leaves. Employees should not be expected to provide notice of leave during personal or family emergencies, but many employees fail to provide proper notice of FMLA leave that is planned or foreseeable. Requiring workers to provide advance notice of foreseeable leave would help businesses plan for a worker’s absence. Recommendations to Cover More Workers Adjust Employee Eligibility Requirements. As a result of FMLA’s eligibility requirements, only 56% of employees receive job protection: 21% of workers are ineligible because of the one-year tenure and 1,250 work hours requirements, 15% of workers are ineligible because their employer has fewer than 50 workers within a 75-mile radius, and 7% are ineligible due to a combination of these criteria. Incremental changes to FMLA’s eligibility criteria can result in a major increase in the law’s coverage. BPC recommends: Reduce the worker tenure requirement from one year to six months; Reduce the work hours requirement from 1,250 hours (24 hours per week) to&hellip;",

Dean Martinez argued that the disruption violated school policies and that “the commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion actually means that we must protect free expression of all views.” Moving forward, she plans “more detailed and explicit” policies to protect both speaker and protestor rights.

    "content": "The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides flexible funding to states and localities to support a wide range of community development related needs. Grantees are required to demonstrate their funded activity is in alignment with one of the program’s three statutory objectives: benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) persons; aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight; or meet an urgent need by addressing conditions that pose a severe and immediate threat to the health and safety of residents. CDBG’s flexible funding allows eligible grantees to support projects that meet their specific local needs unmet by other sources of federal funding. The bulk of annual CDBG spending is directed toward the following four categories: Public improvements: public facilities and infrastructure including water and sewer improvements, street and sidewalk improvements, senior centers, and homeless facilities Housing: housing construction and rehabilitation, public housing modernization, housing payment assistance, building code enforcement, and hazard remediation and mitigation Administration and planning: general program administration, fair housing activities, and regional planning Public services: housing counseling, youth services, transportation services, mental health services, childcare services, and food banks The Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program is the most common source of supplemental funding for CDBG, with funding directed toward long-term recovery efforts in areas impacted by disasters. CDBG-DR largely operates as a separate program from CDBG. How CDBG Funding Works The CDBG Entitlement Program issues approximately 70% of program funding appropriated by Congress to eligible local governments, called “entitlement cities.” Entitlement cities include the principal cities of a region, cities with at least 50,000 people, and urban counties with at least 200,000 people. The amount of funding for entitlement cities is determined by one of two formulas outlined above. A second program allocates the remaining 30% of CDBG funds to states for disbursement to communities that do not meet the population standards to qualify for entitlement funds. State program funds use a similar formula to the entitlement program. Recent Developments The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included $5 billion in supplemental appropriations to HUD’s Community Development Fund, the broader program that includes CDBG, to address the economic and housing instability faced by communities during the pandemic. Of that $5 billion, $2 billion was authorized for the conventional CDBG program, with an additional $1 billion directed to states and insular areas outside the traditional formula, and $2 billion to states and local governments at the HUD Secretary’s discretion. In fiscal year 2022, HUD disbursed about $960 million in CARES Act CDBG funding; in fiscal year 2021, HUD disbursed $964 million. In both years, most of these funds were spent on public services with hundreds of millions of dollars directed towards subsistence payments, which helped families avoid evictions or foreclosures by continuing housing payments, and covered the cost of food, clothing, and utilities. Other top spending categories included financial assistance to businesses ($125 million in fiscal year 2021) and food banks&hellip;",

Which technologies are people describing with the term “face recognition technologies”? Are face recognition technologies different from face analysis and face detection technologies, or are all these terms synonymous? This blog, the first in a series, aims to answer those questions. After providing an overview of the current U.S. face recognition technology legal and policy landscape, this piece explains the many terms and definitions that stakeholders use to refer to face recognition technologies. This blog also highlights the distinctions between face recognition, face analysis, and face detection technologies. Subsequent pieces in the series will explicate the other four key challenges that Members of Congress face when working to advance face recognition technology legislation. Five Key Face Recognition Technology Governance Challenges: 1. Many terms and definitions 2. Many functional applications 3. Many use cases 4. Many ways to assess technical accuracy and performance 5. Many sociotechnical risks and benefits that differ depending on the accuracy and performance of the technology, functional application, and use case. Current U.S. Face Recognition Technology Legal and Policy Landscape The U.S. face recognition technology legal and policy landscape varies across jurisdictions and sectors of society. Existing general and sectoral federal laws may have implications for designing, developing, using, and overseeing face recognition technologies, but no U.S. federal law specifically governs face recognition technology deployments in the public or private sectors. Democrats and Republicans have introduced face recognition technology legislation, but these bills vary widely in their approaches. Few bills have had bipartisan support, and many bills have not even passed out of committee. Absent clear federal legal requirements, a patchwork of state and local laws has emerged. State-level laws include: Broad consumer data privacy laws that address face recognition and/or broader biometric data processing Private-sector biometric data privacy laws that apply to face recognition technologies and/or related data Laws requiring face recognition technology studies Laws imposing requirements and restrictions on law enforcement or broader public-sector use of face recognition technologies Laws temporarily or permanently banning the use of face recognition and/or other biometric technologies in K-12 schools Laws temporarily or indefinitely banning the use of face recognition technologies in conjunction with law enforcement body camera footage Municipal-level laws include: Bans or moratoriums on law enforcement or broader public-sector uses of face recognition and/or other biometric technologies Bans or moratoriums on private-sector use of face recognition technologies Laws imposing requirements and restrictions on law enforcement or broader public-sector use of face recognition technologies Surveillance technology laws with face recognition technology provisions Other, non-legally binding sources of guidance for responsibly designing, developing, using, and overseeing face recognition technologies also abound. Federal government agencies and state government-mandated commissions have studied face recognition technologies and published reports containing policy recommendations. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is conducting an ongoing study entitled “Facial Recognition: Current Capabilities, Future Prospects, and Governance.” Numerous industry groups, user groups, academic research institutions, and civil society organizations&hellip;",

By Matthew Weinzierl, Prithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury, Tarun Khanna, Alan MacCormack, and Brendan Rosseau, Harvard Business Review This Harvard Business Review article identifies four ways to understand how opportunities in space can create value. 1) Data: GPS is a classic example of how data gathered from space about the Earth can create value for society. 2) Capabilities: Space characteristics that people or organizations can use for value creation, such as experimenting in microgravity environments for R&amp;D. 3) Resources: Valuable space assets, including metals and minerals mined from asteroids. 4) Markets: The demand for goods and services spurred by the presence of people in space or servicing space tourism. FCC Unveils Proposed Satellite Direct-to-Device Regulatory Framework Jason Rainbow, Space News The Federal Communications Commission, the agency responsible for much of the satellite industry’s regulation and licensing operations, proposed a framework that aims to enable the innovative use of terrestrial wireless spectrum, connecting smartphones to satellites and expanding coverage beyond the range of cell towers. The framework establishes ground rules for companies with LEO satellites looking to provide direct-to-device services using terrestrial spectrum offered by mobile partners. This groundbreaking news could be the first of many innovative initiatives to close wireless coverage gaps in rural and remote areas through supplemental coverage from space. Lack of Global Internet Lifelines Prompts Calls for a U.S. Plan By Margaret Harding McGill, Axios Harding McGill investigates promising trends for using LEO satellites for internet availability. No longer a distant concept, this technology is bringing important high-speed internet coverage to rural and hard-to-reach parts of the world. She specifically highlights recent examples of LEO constellations delivering internet lifelines to people in conflict zones or under repressive governments. Delivering internet to areas in crisis could improve internet freedom and thwart censorship, but Harding discusses the U.S. government’s lack of public internet infrastructure and funding to provide such security. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle introduced legislation last year to fund technology capable of expanding global internet access.

    "content": "”National debt,” “debt limit,” “annual deficit,” “unfunded liabilities”—the language of federal fiscal policy can be as confusing as it is daunting. It’s easy, too, amidst political fights, to lose sight of some of the larger implications of these issues. In particular, how do the national deficit and debt relate to increasing policymaker concern around U.S. global competitiveness? The Bipartisan Policy Center has long been concerned with the trajectory of the federal debt and its impact on national competitiveness and innovation. The growing national debt poses a threat to U.S. innovation and competitiveness because it could: Limit private investment, depress labor market productivity, and curtail public spending on critical programs necessary to drive competitiveness; and Handcuff our ability to respond to the next global challenge, be it another public health emergency or threat from a geopolitical adversary. Crowding Out Investment at Home During the past decade, the U.S. government’s debt increased at a faster rate than at any time since the end of World War II. Today, our debt is on pace to be double the size of our economy within 30 years. Interest paid on the debt already exceeds the federal government’s spending on Medicaid and is projected to exceed all defense spending by 2029. In time, this could raise borrowing costs throughout the economy, deterring private investment and slowing economic growth. Such contraction would have spillover effects into the labor market as employees ultimately bear the costs through depressed wages and lower productivity, disincentivizing their participation in the labor force and further straining the economy. The economic theory of crowding out—that current and projected federal deficits will have a detrimental effect on private capital expenditures by consuming capital that would otherwise be used to invest—is of critical significance to analyzing the impacts associated with our nation’s debt burden. The crowding-out effect could impact not only private investment but also federal spending. Higher interest payments owed on the national debt would eventually force the government’s hand in making difficult fiscal tradeoffs. This could greatly inhibit our ability to compete and innovate on the global stage by reducing spending on national priorities key for economic growth—like national defense, investments in clean energy, education and workforce training, and medical and scientific research—as they are relatively deprioritized against meeting our interest obligations. This could directly set back the next generation of workers and taxpayers, the most crucial component to our international comparative advantage, as competitiveness depends on a nation’s ability to employ its economic resources productively. Threatening Our Ability to Lead Abroad Our national debt, and therefore our strategy to manage it, is also central to geopolitical security. In 2016, a bipartisan group of former senior government officials singled out our national debt as the “single greatest threat” to our national security. This echoed a 2010 warning by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Admiral Michael Mullen that “the most significant threat to our national security is our debt.” To finance government activities, the Treasury Department must issue securities in the capital markets to&hellip;",

Understandably, the first item of business has been getting BIL funds out the door. But the law also includes a wide variety of statutory changes, pilot programs, and technical provisions. To fulfill the promise of the BIL to transform America’s infrastructure, attention must now turn to other elements of the law. At the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), which received the bulk of BIL funding, most grant programs have opened for at least one round of applications (though some are still pending, including the competitive PROTECT, Congestion Relief, and Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Programs). Several other elements of the BIL, including technical assistance and pilot programs as well as regulations and guidance documents, are still in development. Technical Assistance and Pilot Programs The BIL authorized several technical assistance programs to complement USDOT’s already extensive offerings. This will help state and local agencies deliver projects more quickly and cost effectively. In addition, the BIL included a number of pilot programs to test specific concepts and strategies. Several of these programs have yet to be launched. Intended to help prepare for a transition away from the gas tax as the primary revenue source for federal transportation spending, two of the pending programs relate to infrastructure financing: The National Motor Vehicle Per-Mile User Fee Pilot (BIL Section 13002) will assess the viability of a national per-mile user fee to provide a sustainable revenue source for the Highway Trust Fund. While experts have discussed this approach for years, and a handful of states have piloted mileage-based user fees (alternatively called vehicle miles traveled fees), a national pilot offers the opportunity to fully assess the merits and challenges of this approach. The Transfer and Sale of Toll Credits Pilot Program (BIL Section 11503) will set up an exchange in which selected states can buy and sell toll credits. Federal law allows states to apply toll revenue that they reinvest in transportation toward the local match required on federally funded transportation projects. At the end of federal fiscal year 2022, 28 states had more than $38 billion in unused toll credits. The exchange program will assess whether allowing sales of toll credits across states will enable more use of toll credits and will evaluate the impact on overall transportation expenditures. The BIL also authorized several programs to build analytical capacity at the state and local levels, which has been a barrier to effective project planning and partnerships with the private sector. Key upcoming programs include: The Asset Concession and Innovative Finance Program (BIL Section 71001) will provide grants to states, localities, and tribal governments to help them identify, analyze, and plan potential public-private partnerships. This program can improve the ability of public sector agencies to engage with the private sector, bringing additional capital and expertise to bear on infrastructure challenges.

    "content": "Several tax provisions—such as the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit (45F), and the Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave (45S)—help parents in the U.S. offset the costs of juggling work and kids. Americans often favor income support delivered as tax credits because they afford families and business owners the flexibility to meet multiple needs. As Congress continues to consider modifications to the tax code, BPC encourages policymakers to balance promoting financial stability for families with incentivizing workforce participation, better targeting benefits toward the most vulnerable families and businesses, and offering complementary—not conflicting—benefits. Key tax credits for working families and BPC’s reform suggestions: Child Tax Credit: The CTC is designed to help parents offset the high cost of raising children. Despite its success in curbing child poverty, nearly 35% of low-income households remain ineligible for the full credit in its current form. BPC has outlined a path that makes a portion of the credit fully available regardless of earnings while phasing in the remainder of the credit starting with the first dollar earned. This maintains work incentives that can help strengthen financial security in the near-term while improving earnings and childhood outcomes in the long-term. Earned Income Tax Credit: The EITC is designed to raise after-tax income for low-income workers by supplementing wages and incentivizing increased earnings. Not only does the EITC pull nearly five million people out of poverty each year, it dramatically boosts employment rates, particularly for unmarried women. Notably, the EITC is disproportionately more generous for working parents with multiple children. BPC suggests several reforms to enhance the EITC, such as increasing it for workers with one or no children (making it proportionally similar to the EITC currently available for two- and three-child households) and improving the compliance process to reduce erroneous claims. Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit: The CDCTC is designed to help offset a portion of families’ child or dependent care expenses. Working parents may receive a nonrefundable tax credit for eligible child care expenses. However, the CDCTC’s current structure has failed to support those with little to no tax liability who are excluded from its benefits. BPC recommends making the CDCTC refundable, advanceable, and phasing out the credit for higher-income families. Additionally, decoupling Dependent Care Assistance Program (DCAP) exclusions from CDCTC expenditures would enable low- and middle-income workers to set aside money for child care without reducing the maximum expenses they can claim for the CDCTC. Employer-Provided Child Care Credit (45F): To incentivize business owners to provide child care for their employees, 45F offers a tax credit of up to 25% of qualified child care expenditures and 10% of qualified child care resource and referral expenditures. Each year, limited access to child care causes businesses to lose upwards of $1,500 per working parent due to decreased productivity, less time working, and increased recruitment expenses. Despite the tax relief that the 45F credit provides, relatively few businesses have&hellip;",

    "content": "The 2023 Social Security Trustees’ Report underscores a fact we have known for decades: Social Security’s finances are on an unsustainable path. Unless Congress acts, the program’s primary trust fund—the old-age and survivors insurance (OASI) trust fund—will only be able to pay full scheduled benefits until 2033, as shown in Figures 1-3. Since 2012, the trustees have consistently projected trust fund depletion between 2032 and 2035, highlighting the harsh reality that Congressional inaction means allowing an across-the-board cut of nearly 25% of all monthly benefit payments in just over a decade. Figure 1: The Looming Benefit Cliff Social Security is the foundation on which most Americans build their retirement. It pays benefits to retirees, their families, and people with disabilities, lifting millions out of poverty each year. Even so, on top of its financial challenges, the program’s tax and benefit structure is outdated, disincentivizing workforce participation while failing to provide adequate financial security to those who rely most on the program. But restoring Social Security’s fiscal health and enhancing benefits for vulnerable beneficiaries are not mutually exclusive goals. In fact, tackling them together is the best way to ensure the program can adequately support future generations and attract the necessary bipartisan support for Social Security reform. For several decades after policymakers last reformed Social Security in 1983, the program’s income exceeded its expenses, generating large trust fund surpluses. In recent years, however, annual benefit payments began to surpass income. Figure 2: Social Security’s OASI Trust Fund to Be Depleted in 2033 Figure 3: Social Security’s Shortfall Continues to Grow One big reason is demographics. The ratio of workers paying Social Security payroll taxes to people drawing benefits has dropped from four-to-one in 1965 to just under three-to-one in 2022. As shown in Figure 4, that ratio is projected to drop to less than 2.5-to-one by 2030 as baby boomers continue to retire, people live longer, and working lives have not proportionally increased. Figure 4: The Worker-to-Beneficiary Ratio Continues to Decline At the same time, Social Security’s tax base is shrinking as a share of national earnings. Social Security’s payroll tax, which covered 90% of total earnings in 1983, is projected to cover just 80% this year, as shown in Figure 5. This trend largely stems from growing income inequality: around 6% of workers have earned more than the taxable maximum ($160,200 in 2023) for four decades, but the labor income of those top earners has grown much faster than that of lower earners, placing more earnings above the taxable cap. Figure 5: Social Security’s Shrinking Tax Base In 2016, a Bipartisan Policy Center commission recommended steps to make Social Security solvent and modern. Among other reforms, the commission proposed: Restructuring the benefit formula to increase progressivity and better reward continued work Establishing a new minimum benefit to help those with low lifetime earnings and reduce elder poverty Increasing the retirement age gradually to reflect increases in U.S. life expectancy Bringing in more revenue, partially by restoring the taxable base to&hellip;",

As 2023 state legislative sessions adjourn, a notable trend has emerged among Republican trifecta states (where they control all three state branches). In Idaho, Mississippi, South Dakota, and Wyoming, among others. Republicans are standing up for voter access and listening to election administrators in showing signs of reversing course on restrictive elections policy. State legislatures saw a plethora of bills introduced this year that would limit absentee voting, ban drop boxes, reduce early voting, and impose new criminal and civil penalties on voters and election administrators. When bills restricting voter access and tried and true practices are enacted, voter access suffers, and election administrators are penalized for simple mistakes. By refusing passage to restrictive and needlessly burdensome legislation these Republican-majority legislatures may be paving the way for a return to bipartisan agreement on election policies. Idaho In Idaho, two bills introduced that would have limited voter access were defeated on the House floor. HB137 would have ended the use of affidavits for voters without identification at the polls, denying voters who forgot or lost their photo identification the ability to vote. HB205 would have eliminated no-excuse absentee voting. In both instances, opposition was bipartisan. Speaking against HB137, Rep. Britt Raybould (R) told legislators that it is already a felony to provide false, erroneous, or inaccurate information on voter affidavits in Idaho. She argued that the bill was unnecessary and prevented eligible registered voters from exercising their constitutional right. Rep. Stephanie Jo Mickelsen (R) shared a personal story about her husband who had forgotten his driver&#8217;s license on election day and noted that without the option to sign an affidavit he would not have been able to cast his ballot. When elections are already secure, additional requirements for voters and election administrators often create needless burden and complication. Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane(R) and former Secretary of State Lawerence Denney (R) repeatedly said that Idaho elections are secure and widespread voter fraud is not occurring. They both pointed to existing state elections laws, consistent results from elections audits, recounts and the public testing and demonstration of ballot tabulation equipment as evidence of the security and integrity of Idaho elections. South Dakota South Dakota legislators considered HB1217 to eliminate no-excuse absentee balloting, prohibit the use of drop boxes, and shorten the early voting period. HB1217 was brought to the House floor and failed because of strong bipartisan opposition. Opponents argued that eliminating drop boxes would hurt rural voters and that the legislature should listen to the state auditor&#8217;s objections to the legislation. The bill failed in a tie vote, was brought back for reconsideration, and failed again after losing support with 30 members voting in favor and 39 voting in opposition.

    "content": "“Road to Reauthorization,” a new blog series, builds off BPC’s latest small business report, Small Agency, Big Mandate: A Bipartisan Road Map to Modernizing SBA. Nearly 23 years since the last reauthorization of the Small Business Administration (SBA), the report explores the importance of top-to-bottom congressional reviews as a key aspect of good governance and outlines ideas for Congress to consider when updating and reforming the agency through reauthorization. The series provides small business owners, stakeholders, and advocates with updates and insight on congressional progress toward reauthorization of SBA. Members of Congress are fond of extolling the virtues of small businesses and their role as the “backbone” of the American economy. Do their actions back up their words? By one measure, the answer is clearly “yes.” In the 117th Congress, 110 and 180 bills were referred to the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee and the House Small Business Committee, respectively. Many of those bills had support from both parties. BPC identified at least 68 bills with bipartisan cosponsors just dealing with the “three C’s” of SBA: capital, contracting, and counseling. If we included in our count bills pertaining to small businesses that move through other committees—whether on banking policy, workforce, taxes, or many other issues relevant to small businesses—the number would be much higher. Authoring legislation is, of course, a central responsibility of Congress. The number of bills introduced pertaining to small businesses and SBA—especially with bipartisan backing—indicates substantial interest from members of Congress in supporting small businesses. An even better measure of the importance that lawmakers place on SBA support for small businesses is the number of bills that get passed by either chamber with bipartisan support. In the 118th Congress, the House has already passed three bipartisan SBA-related bills: H.R. 400, the Investing in Main Street Act; H.R. 449, the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act; and H.R. 399, the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act. Each of these bills also passed the House in the last Congress before stalling in the Senate. Access to capital is a perennial concern for small businesses and closing gaps in capital access has been a longstanding goal of policymakers. The Investing in Main Street and Microloan Transparency and Accountability Acts tackle these issues by trying to expand the amount of money available to small business investment companies (who invest in growing small businesses) and by gathering more data on microloans, specifically those made to rural small businesses. The Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act recognizes the role of small businesses in international trade and seeks to expand the scope of the SBA Office of Advocacy’s responsibilities accordingly. A Journey of a Thousand Miles … Admittedly, these are relatively minor and noncontroversial bills (two passed by voice vote and the other, H.R. 400, passed 411-13). On their own, each make small changes for SBA and its customers—America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs. Yet their passage is encouraging for three reasons. First, with the House flipping control from Democrats to Republicans after the 2022 midterms, lawmakers&hellip;",

Specifically, will the federal government’s response to these bank failures consume resources that are being used to forestall the X Date, the day when the Treasury Department would no longer be able to meet all its obligations in full and on time? (Check out BPC’s latest analysis.) The short answer—at least for now—is “no.” The two main policy responses thus far have been insuring all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and standing up a facility at the Federal Reserve to help other banks solve similar liquidity challenges. Let’s take them one at a time. Funds for deposit insurance are obtained from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s trust fund that has accumulated assets—in the form of non-marketable U.S. Treasury securities—from its collections of deposit insurance. When making payouts to depositors, those securities are redeemed, creating room under the debt limit (since government trust funds also count towards total debt). Then, an equivalent amount of debt is issued to the public, raising the cash to pay out depositors. The entire transaction is a wash as far as the debt limit is concerned. The Federal Reserve’s Bank Term Funding Program will provide liquidity to qualifying institutions by offering loans in exchange for various forms of collateral. These will be market-based transactions with no expectation of realized losses, but as a backstop, the Treasury Department has pledged up to $25 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), which happens to be one of the trust funds that the Treasury Department can utilize for debt limit extraordinary measures. The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve do not expect ESF funds to be needed as a backstop for the new program. Nonetheless, in the unlikely event they are tapped over the next few months, the resources would probably come from a portion of the ESF separate from its non-marketable U.S. Treasury securities (which would be insufficient to cover the total amount). Thus, although there’s a possibility of modestly accelerating the X Date time frame, that scenario seems remote. Of course, it’s possible that policymakers will need to take further action to stabilize the banking sector in the coming weeks and months. BPC will monitor evolving policy responses and their potential impact on the debt limit. Meanwhile, we continue to track daily cash flows and will update our X Date analysis after the conclusion of tax season.",

    "content": "Meeting our net-zero goals will require the deployment of emissions reducing technologies and pathways for directly removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For the latter category, innovation and funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law have the United States on a trajectory towards global leadership in deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, including direct air capture (DAC), but gaps remain to effectively scale these solutions. In this context, a bipartisan conversation surrounding the role of the federal government in purchasing carbon removal services has emerged, ultimately leading to congressional direction for the Department of Energy to “establish a competitive purchasing pilot program for the purchase of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere or upper hydrosphere” as part of the Fiscal Year 2023 appropriations omnibus bill. With this new pilot program to procure CDR services, DOE can provide needed demand-side support for the carbon removal industry to catalyze investment and reach gigaton scale. Critical design decisions will determine the program’s effectiveness at scaling up the carbon removal industry and the type of carbon removal projects that will receive private sector investment. To inform DOE and Congress in the effective design of the pilot CDR procurement program, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a private, off-the-record workshop with NGOs and industry stakeholders familiar with the intricacies of procuring CDR services. The workshop included a discussion on goals and design characteristics of the procurement program, with questions about how to best leverage private sector expertise and catalyze additional investments to multiply federal dollars spent. While there was no consensus position among all participants, the following categories reflect considerations brought up during the discussion. Defining Goals There was agreement that goal-setting would be important in determining optimal design for the pilot program. Possible goals discussed in the workshop included: Building administrative capacity at DOE to expand toward a larger procurement program in the future Driving down the cost of CDR technologies Maximizing innovation potential Driving standards for removals that could permeate more broadly to other governments or the private sector Minimizing political risk Getting “wins” and delivering actual removals Showing proof of concept of the co-benefits of some CDR projects to make future investment more attractive Supporting DAC Hubs to the extent that some project types could make use of and contribute to that shared infrastructure Bridging the innovation “valley of death” by focusing on projects at the pilot and demonstration stages. It is worth noting that some of these potential goals are in opposition. How DOE chooses to establish and prioritize the above goals will influence the execution and outcomes of the program. Choosing How to Prioritize Projects Throughout the workshop, a wide range of criteria were discussed for how best to prioritize projects and establish eligible technologies for the program. Weighing the relative importance of each of the criteria will directly impact the type of projects that receive support, future industry standards, and overall scale-up potential. Participants raised project criteria that loosely fit within the following categories, but there was not a consensus on&hellip;",

While some say that these are rare events on just a few campuses, the 2022 Knight-Ipsos College Student Views on Free Expression and Campus Speech national survey found one-third of students support speech codes; a quarter favor disinviting speakers whose speech is perceived as offensive or biased; and one-fifth favor restricting the expression of political views that are offensive or upsetting. Concurrently, public confidence in higher education has eroded, and now some states are considering legislation to regulate academic freedom, tenure, and curricula. Are universities abdicating their responsibilities as stewards of open inquiry? These state legislatures seem to think so. If you believe that universities should not be dictated to on these matters, what should they do to regain lawmakers’ trust and confidence in their leadership? Higher education institutions have an important role in preparing students to join America’s diverse workforce where colleagues’ and customers’ backgrounds and views may differ from their own. However, a 2022 NBC News and Generation Lab survey of college sophomores found: 54% wouldn’t room with someone who supported the other presidential candidate in the 2020 election; 62% of college students “probably” or “definitely” would not work for a company that made financial donations to a cause at odds with their values. The polarization of young people is bipartisan: a 2020 Cato Institute survey found 44% of those under 30 favored firing an executive who donated to former President Donald Trump, while 27% of those under 30 favored firing an executive who donated to President Joe Biden’s campaign. What should higher education institutions do to foster student skills and habits of mind to prepare students to be productive in communities and workplaces where others will disagree with them on important&hellip;",

    "content": "Competitiveness has become an area of intense bipartisan interest and concern in Washington. From the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act last year to the creation of a House Select Committee on China earlier this Congress, policymakers are keen to enhance U.S. economic performance relative to other countries. Not incidentally, this also reflects the views of voters, for whom “strengthening the economy” is the top policy priority. Over the last year, the Bipartisan Policy Center has engaged in several public and private discussions and research to ensure that we understand what “competitiveness” means, how different issues relate to it, and what, specifically, policymakers need to know when it comes to economic and security matters with China. While policymakers in Washington tend to speak, naturally, in national terms, the work of competitiveness really happens at the local and regional levels. That’s where individuals, companies, universities, and others carry out their activities which ultimately shape overall U.S. economic competitiveness. Congress, to its credit, appears to grasp this, having appropriated or authorized tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investments for “placed-based industrial policy” in the last few years. To better understand local and regional competitiveness efforts, we’ve embarked on a series of roundtables around the country. At each stop, we speak to as many people and organizations as possible for insight into what American competitiveness looks like on the frontlines. We hope that our findings will be useful to local, state, and national policymakers looking to bolster U.S. competitiveness. The first roundtable was held in Tampa a few weeks ago. Why Tampa? Tampa was selected as the inaugural roundtable location partly due to its extraordinary nexus of national security, entrepreneurship, and supply chains. Tampa is home to MacDill Air Force Base, U.S. Central Command, and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). It’s the only location where two geographical combatant commands reside together—their regional economic impact is enormous. Another local Tampa resident is SOFWERX, an organization created in 2015 through a partnership intermediary agreement between USSOCOM and DEFENSEWERX. It was intended to bring innovation to bear on special operations challenges by engaging a broader community of small businesses, academia, and other “nontraditional” partners. By some measures of economic competitiveness, Tampa excels compared to other cities and regions. On other measures, the need for improvement is apparent. According to the local State of the Region report, while Tampa outperforms the country in “business establishment startup rate,” it lags in innovation indicators such as Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer program (SBIR/STTR) awards per capita, placing 17th out of 19 comparison regions. SBIR and STTR awards are a critical source of federal funding aimed at spurring the development and commercialization of new technologies. Tampa’s startup ecosystem is growing but trails other U.S. regions on key measures. There is, however, a plethora of organizations devoted to enhancing the region’s economic vitality—and that’s part of what drew us there.

    "content": "The Commerce Department recently announced that, to be eligible for subsidies and incentives created by the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, semiconductor companies must have plans in place to help workers find and access child care. That requirement comes on top of others, such as wage levels and use of American-made construction materials. Over the past two years, BPC has worked with members of both parties on policies that would enhance U.S. national competitiveness. BPC has also worked with lawmakers in both parties for many years on child care, seeking policies that will ensure not only a robust supply of high-quality providers but also increase affordability for families. Semiconductor support was the central piece of the CHIPS and Science Act. The Commerce Department’s announcement was a surprise to many and received a good deal of media attention. Here, we look at arguments on both sides of the issue. Semiconductor companies are in line to benefit from tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer support for construction of new manufacturing facilities. Reinvigorating domestic semiconductor capacity is, for both Republicans and Democrats, an urgent national priority. Because semiconductors are central to our daily lives—and because domestic production has steadily declined over three decades—policymakers view public support for the industry as essential for national security and economic competitiveness. Ensuring broad access to high-quality, affordable child care is also a national priority that both parties agree is urgent. We know that lack of such access has been a significant barrier to millions of Americans returning to the workforce or participating fully in the economy. On the supply side, operating a child care business means living on the barest margin of profitability. The balance between affordability and quality (which is shaped by the need for well-trained staff and compliance with staffing ratios and government regulations) is often elusive. Doling out billions of taxpayer dollars to support a specific industry and individual companies should not be taken lightly by policymakers. It is reasonable to expect beneficiaries to help policymakers address other pressing concerns. The semiconductor industry, moreover, has not been bashful in calling for more taxpayer support. Almost as soon as the ink was dry on the president’s signature on CHIPS and Science, the industry said more subsidies and incentives would be needed. Construction on some facilities has been slowed by shortages of qualified workers. Women, on whom the child care burden falls hardest, have long been underrepresented in the technology manufacturing and construction workforces. At a time when labor markets are historically tight, this is an effort to help companies find workers and expand opportunities for women. Requiring semiconductor companies to ensure child care access will thus help fill one of their own needs: they can’t find the workers to build the new facilities. The child care requirement is not piling on or attaching unrelated conditions—it will spur the industry to address one of its self-professed bottlenecks. The path to achieving high-quality, affordable child care for everyone who needs it must rely heavily on the&hellip;",

    "content": "In today’s tight labor market, businesses across the country are struggling to recruit and retain staff. What many businesses do not realize is that parents’ child care responsibilities are part of the problem. In December 2022, the Bipartisan Policy Center surveyed parents and employers to understand the role child care plays in their decision making. BPC found that nearly 7 in 10 business owners do not think child care impacts their ability to hire or retain staff, but more than half of parents say child care responsibilities influence their decisions about where to work. This gap suggests that businesses are unaware of the extent that child care impacts their business, underestimating their role in supporting working parents. A lack of child care significantly impacts parents’ ability to work, leading parents to struggle to meet work responsibilities, change hours, or leave the workforce. Businesses benefit from parents having stable child care. Sixty-one percent of business owners think they have some responsibility for child care, but the degree businesses support parents varies widely. Businesses have a unique opportunity to support working parents by offering prioritized scheduling, flexible hours, and remote work. Many parents who work hourly jobs (56%) don’t know their schedules more than two weeks in advance, making it nearly impossible to find child care on such short notice. This survey is the tenth in BPC’s series designed to understand parents’ child care needs and preferences. A summary of the survey findings, including the gaps between parents’ child care needs and small business owners’ perceptions of those needs is highlighted below. Changing Work Arrangements: During the pandemic, parents experienced a variety of changes in employment and child care arrangements. 53% of parents changed their work schedule, women are more likely than men to say that their work schedule changed (56% vs. 48%). 44% of spouses/partners changed their work schedule. 44% of parents changed their primary child care arrangement. 43% of parents changed jobs. Hiring and Retention: COVID-19 impacted small business owners/executives’ ability to attract and retain their workforce. A majority of small business owners/executives say access to child care does not impact employee retention (68%) or hiring (66%) at their business. One in four small business owners/executives say child care is not important to their job or business. More than half of parents say child care responsibilities have been a factor in accepting a job (56%) and reducing their hours (52%). Two in five parents (38%) say that their child care responsibilities have impacted their ability to work over the past month. Among those who have missed work, over half (56%) have missed 10+ hours of work in the past month due to child care responsibilities. Accommodations Provided: There is a disconnect between what benefits businesses say they offer and what working parents understand they are eligible for. Small business owners/executives are more likely than parents to say their business offers paid parental leave (53% vs 42%), unpaid parental leave (50% vs 44%), flexible hours (56% vs 46%), remote work options&hellip;",

    "content": "For the two-thirds of military service members who rely on the “civilian” housing market, recent polls and surveys show that finding and affording housing is increasingly difficult. Lengthy commutes, unsafe living conditions, and exorbitant housing costs are just some of the symptoms of a broader national housing supply shortage that directly and acutely affects military service members, civilian staff at military installations, and their families. This blog answers basic questions about the state of military housing and highlights potential reforms to provide greater housing stability to America’s men and women in uniform and their families. What is the Basic Allowance for Housing? The Department of Defense (DoD) provides a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for service members stationed in the United States. With military base pay typically lower than salaries in other sectors, housing assistance has historically been the largest component of service members’ compensation after basic pay. The amount service members receive depends on their location, pay grade, and dependency status. The rate is subdivided further for different housing profiles that are linked to military pay grades, as shown below: The BAH is designed to cover 95% of average costs for an off-base housing unit and utilities. From 2005 to 2014, it covered 100% of local average housing costs. However, DoD requested Congress reduce the percentage to slow the growth of BAH costs. In response, the 2015 and 2016 National Defense Authorization Acts authorized DoD to lower BAH rates and eliminate renter’s insurance costs from the housing allowance calculation. The BAH is excluded from income for federal tax purposes—though it does count as income when calculating a service member’s eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other federal nutrition assistance benefits. How is the BAH calculated? Each year, DoD sets the BAH rate for approximately 300 Military Housing Areas (MHAs), which are made up of zip codes near military bases. By law, BAH rates are based on the average cost of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same areas. DoD employs contractors to collect data on housing and utility costs in neighborhoods near bases, perform on-site evaluations, and estimate the amount that service members can expect to pay. This BAH calculation process aims to attain a 95% statistical confidence that the estimated median rent is within 10% of the true median rent in the local market. This is a time-intensive process, with DoD contractors collecting and verifying rental cost information in each MHA for multiple housing types by consulting housing offices, real estate property management companies, listing services, subscription-based commercial rental housing datasets, landlords, and other local sources. However, despite the rigorous research to set BAH, some argue it fails to cover the basic housing costs of military families across many MHAs. Why is the BAH not covering housing costs? Recent polls of military service members and their families show housing costs are among their top concerns. Reports of families paying significantly above BAH to secure rental housing, as well as bidding beyond their&hellip;",

    "content": "In February, BPC hosted two reciprocal American Congressional Exchange Trips. Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH) visited Rep. Robin Kelly’s (D-IL) district in Illinois and Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) visited Rep. Ed Cases’ (D-HI) district in Hawaii. Illinois 2nd Congressional District Trip Recap Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District roughly follows the old Illinois Central railroad line, which departs from Chicago, runs along Lake Michigan to the south and into rural communities like Kankakee. Railroad history and its present-day importance loomed large during Rep. Latta’s reciprocal American Congressional Exchange trip to visit Rep. Kelly. Rep. Kelly toured his northwest Ohio district last fall. During the trip, Rep. Latta observed numerous freight line operations, warehouse and distribution centers, trucking facilities, and logistics centers that are critical to the economy of the region. Rail lines also cross arterial roads in the south suburbs (known as Chicago Southland), which can cause inconvenience for autos. Rep. Latta experienced this first-hand when the vehicle he was riding in was delayed before Rep. Kelly offered a detour. The first morning stop for the two members was the Steve Warrick Family Farm in Monee, where they met with a group of farmers and leaders from the Illinois Farm Bureau to discuss water and energy policy and innovations in land management and genetic seeding. In Richton Park, a diverse, middle-class suburb, Reps. Kelly and Latta talked with local mayors about what support they need from the federal government, in partnership with state and local government. Additionally, they talked about the impact of recently passed federal legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act. The next focus of the ACE trip was healthcare, a shared interest on which Reps. Kelly and Latta have collaborated. The two members visited Family Christian Maternal Health Center in Harvey, a Federal Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that provides family medicine, maternal child health/wellness, OB/GYN, and pediatric services. Both came away impressed with the quality medical care the Center offers to underserved populations. From there, Reps. Latta and Kelly met with leaders from regional “safety-net” hospitals. These hospitals serve low-income populations, regardless of patients’ insurance coverage, ability to pay, or immigration status. The hospital leaders talked about the nursing shortage, but also how the agencies that “supply” nurses to hospitals are incredibly expensive. Issues lingering from the COVID-19 pandemic are also driving up costs for these hospitals. The last two stops of the day were transportation related. First, a tour of the Ford Torrence Avenue Assembly Plant, the company’s oldest assembly operation. Over 4,000 skilled employees make the Lincoln Aviator and Explorer SUVs on this 113-acre site. The visit included a conversation about the advent of electric vehicles and what steps Ford is taking to balance electric and traditional fuel vehicle production. The trip then ended where it began – with railroads. At the Pullman National Historic Park, managed by the National Park Service, Reps. Kelly and Latta learned about the first planned industrial community in the U.S., home to the Pullman Palace Car manufacturing&hellip;",

    "content": "In recent decades, the United States has come to rely heavily on foreign manufacturers for advanced semiconductors today produces only 10% of global chip capacity, down from 37% in 1990. A 2022 bipartisan law, the CHIPS and Science Act, creates opportunity to reverse the trend and bring chip production back to the U.S. This is a win for our economy and national security–the lack of domestic production capacity has been identified by American lawmakers as a significant threat to national competitiveness. The CHIPS and Science Act is the largest investment in the American semiconductor industry in decades, providing $52.7 billion in funding for semiconductor manufacturing, R&amp;D, and workforce training. After three decades of decline, the CHIPS and Science Act affords a once-in-a-generation opportunity to restore U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing, but it’s a long road ahead to accomplish the goals of the legislation by 2030. The U.S. Department of Commerce, through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), launched the first semiconductor related funding opportunity created by the CHIPS and Science Act in February 2023. Applicants selected for the program will receive the awards in the form “of direct funding, federal loans and/or federal guarantees of third-party loans.” This funding mechanism is not to be confused by another incentive created by the CHIPS and Science Act, the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit, administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. This tax credit, already available to companies, is equal to 25% of qualifying investments in facilities manufacturing semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Now that implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act is in full swing, it’s critical that policymakers understand the complex manufacturing process behind semiconductors as well as the current state of the domestic industry. Semiconductor chips are the basis of many products we use in our daily lives as well as an enormous range of electronics and machines—from mobile phones to Javelin missiles. They play a vital role across industry while enabling technological advancements and driving innovation. In a way, they are the foundation of modern competitiveness. But what does it take to build a cutting-edge chip, and what does that mean for policymakers? How Are Semiconductor Chips Made? Source: ASML, Intel, ASE Group Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely complex and capital-intensive. First, silicon dioxide (silica sand) is heated with carbon to form a block of pure silicon, or an ingot. Ingots are then sliced into wafers to become the basis of the semiconductor chip. Wafers can vary in size with each containing between dozens and thousands of chips. The next step is “front-end manufacturing” at a semiconductor fabrication plant (more commonly known as a “fab”). The wafer then proceeds along a complicated process which is, in summary: Deposition: Wafers are polished and a blanket of conducting, semi-conducting, or isolating materials is deposited on its surface. Coating: A light-sensitive coating called photoresist is applied. Lithography: The wafer then undergoes photolithography, in which light hits the photoresist and creates a microscopic pattern. This requires extremely specialized&hellip;",

    "content": "The Biden administration recently inserted child care requirements for companies accessing funding in the new CHIPS Act, a bill to promote the development of the U.S. silicon chip industry. While access to affordable childcare, the requirement most reported on by media, is a laudable goal, the way the Biden administration has added this requirement, outside of congressional intent or language, is troubling. It is also part of a multi-decade power struggle between the president and Congress in which we have seen Congress increasingly cede power, while the executive arrogates increasingly more power onto itself. How Did We Get Here? In the late 1980s, the George H.W. Bush administration was challenged with what seemed to be a permanent Democratic majority in Congress. Democrats had control of the House since 1954, and control of the Senate for all but six years of that period. With no inkling that the 1994 Gingrich-led Republican takeover was in the offing, the Bush administration deployed a veto strategy to shape legislation. Bush learned from his time in the Gerald Ford administration the power of the veto as a tool for blunting Congress’ ability to get what it wanted, and he deployed the tool effectively, with 43 out of 44 of his vetoes being sustained. At the same time, Bush’s frequent use of the veto alienated Congress, creating what historian John Robert Greene called “a chain of legislative acrimony.” When George W. Bush was president he did not use, or have to use, the veto nearly as frequently; he used another strategy to assert his will vis a vis Congress, namely, the signing statement. Here, rather than vetoing a bill the president states that he will not enforce or use their own interpretation to enforce specific provisions of a law. Bush was not the first or only president to use the signing statement, but using these statements to lay out what the Bush administration felt that congressionally-passed bills meant was criticized at the time as violating the separation of powers. While the Bush administration based its views on the language of the bills themselves, it was still a sticking point between the two branches. President Obama took things to a new level with his declaration of “a pen and a phone” presidency. After a string of legislative successes in his first two years, Obama never again had an all-Democratic Congress to work with, so he explored the use of executive powers to accomplish his goals. Sometimes he would use those powers to do things that even he had previously said were unconstitutional, specifically his executive order allowing “dreamers” – children who came to the U.S. with parents who entered illegally – to remain in country. This step was notable in contrast to Obama’s previous declaration that such an action was outside the existing powers of the president. When Donald Trump was president, he also toyed with expanding the powers of the presidency beyond what Congress had intended. The most notable example of this was probably Trump’s declaration of&hellip;",

The idea of political persuasion and data mining suddenly felt very close to every Facebook user, and the aftermath of the scandal included rethinking the ethics of data privacy and the growing impact of social media on electoral politics. Cambridge Analytica still impacts the digital democracy space today. Anatomy of a Scandal Cambridge Analytica was founded in 2013. But the company’s ability to microtarget traces back to a 2010 Facebook rollout of open graph that included a new version of its API, which is a tool that allows one application to access the data or features of another. With the API, “developers could now see social connections between people, and see the connections people have based on their interests and likes.” Some examples of how open graph was used include President Obama’s campaign, which built an app that would connect known Obama supporters to potential supporters. The idea was that these two groups of users–demonstrated supporters and potential ones–had something in common, such as being friends on Facebook or that they both liked a particular sports team. In a non-political context, apps like Farmville would use the API so people could see which of their friends were also playing their game and how users might interact while in the app. The tool has other practical campaign applications as well. Aleksander Kogan, an academic at the University of Cambridge, used the tool to research Facebook users and determine what might influence their behavior. He eventually gave this data to Cambridge Analytica, a company that provided data-driven services to political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica claimed to be able to use Facebook data for its clients to better target political messages to people that could be influenced, also known as “microtargeting.” Facebook shut down access for new apps to this API in 2014, and the API access was fully shut down in 2015. Breaking the Story On March 17, 2018, the Guardian and New York Times broke the story about a Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, saying that the company had utilized 50 million Facebook profiles to do their modeling. Facebook tried to pre-empt the stories by announcing it had suspended access to everything on Facebook for Cambridge Analytica and an affiliate organization &#8211; the SCL Group. They also took issue with the media calling it a “data breach,” given the information in question wasn’t hacked or stolen and was indeed provided through the API to developers with users’ consent. A few days later, Facebook announced new measures to better protect people’s data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also spoke to numerous media outlets about what happened and what the company was going to do to increase trust and safety. Zuckerberg outlined an investigation and full audit into apps that had access to large amounts of data before the platform was changed in 2015. He also introduced restrictions on developers’ access to data and a tool for users to see which apps they&hellip;",

The Energy Act of 2020, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act authorized and funded more than $8.5 billion for critical minerals activities at the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior (DOI). These programs are beginning to take shape but require sustained congressional appropriations funding as the agencies carry out their intended purpose. Meeting U.S. clean energy, economic, and national security goals will necessitate deployment of next-generation low- and zero-carbon infrastructure. These projects require increased levels of critical mineral content that we currently primarily source from abroad. The following initiatives, authorized in the bills mentioned above, will help address the research, resource assessment, and workforce development needs of a domestic supply chain. As Congress looks to support critical mineral supply chains, it can consider providing appropriation funding to continue support for these important programs, along with support to existing agency efforts to deploy a safe and secure critical minerals supply chain: DOE Research and Development – The United States is a world leader in scientific research and innovation. An important example of progress in this area is DOE’s rare earth and critical mineral recovery program from unconventional resources like coal waste and ash. Below are DOE R&amp;D programs that Congress can consider funding to help build out U.S. supply. DOE’s Critical Minerals and Materials Crosscutting Initiative carries out research, development, demonstration, and commercialization activities across DOE’s programs to develop alternatives to, recycling of, and efficient production of critical minerals and materials. This supports the following two programs authorized by BIL, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Energy Act, in addition to others: Carbon Materials Science Initiative, authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act (42 USC 18911(e)). Establishes a new research initiative to expand the fundamental knowledge of coal, coal-wastes, and carbon ore chemistry useful for understanding the conversion of carbon to material products. Additional Research Activities, including the newly authorized activities in the Energy Act of 2020 (30 USC 1606). Subsections (g) and (h) of the Act were funded by the BIL and include a program for R&amp;D on critical minerals, the creation of a Critical Materials Consortium for multidisciplinary critical materials research, and a Critical Materials Supply Chain Research Facility. Central to the execution of these activities is also the Critical Materials Institute. We encourage DOE to continue instituting these programs as soon as possible. USGS Resource Assessments – We can’t mine what we don’t know we have.

Campus Happenings Stanford Faculty Say Anonymous Student Bias Reports Threaten Free Speech Douglas Belkin | The Wall Street Journal | February 23, 2023 A group of 77 Stanford University faculty members petitioned the administration to dismantle the school’s bias reporting policy. Students may anonymously report perceived incidents of bias or discrimination; a report initiates an inquiry and notification to the person alleged to have demonstrated bias. The faculty acted after a bias report led to an investigation of a student seen reading Mein Kampf. An administration spokesperson said the policy “aims to promote a climate of respect.” UNC Board of Governors Approves Ban on Compelled Political Speech David N. Bass | The Carolina Journal | February 23, 2023 On February 23, the University of North Carolina System Board of Governors unanimously approved a prohibition on compelling speech to affirm “beliefs, affiliations, ideals, or principles regarding matters of contemporary political debate or social action as a condition to admission, employment, or professional advancement.” North Carolina State University, a UNC System member school, anticipated the new policy by dropping a question on its application form about diversity. The MAGA-fication of North Idaho College Charles Homans | The New York Times | March 6, 2023 North Idaho College, a community college, had its debt downgraded by Moody’s and was put on notice by the Northwest Commission on Colleges that its accreditation is at risk. The issue: the board of trustees, elected by county voters, is seen as politicizing college governance. The board chair wrote that he and like-minded trustees were “battling the N.I.C. ‘deep state.’” One student lamented, “It’s just that I wanted a place where, conservative or liberal, you could speak your mind.” Idaho College Censors Portions of Art Exhibit for Discussing Abortion Kelcie Moseley-Morris | Idaho Capital Sun | March 7, 2023 Shortly before opening an exhibition of art about health care, Lewis-Clark State College withdrew pieces by three artists whose art addressed abortion. A college spokesman referenced the No Public Funds for Abortion Act to explain the step. The ACLU sent a letter to the college president, alleging the college’s actions violated the First Amendment. State and Federal ‘Never Seen Anything Like It’: New Bill Would Write DeSantis’s Higher Ed Vision into Law Francie Diep | The Chronicle of Higher Education | February 24, 2023 Florida House Bill 999 was filed before the state legislature’s March 9 convening. The bill would advance objectives endorsed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), including prohibiting programs on diversity, equity, and inclusion and critical race theory, and expanding trustees’ role in hiring, promotion, and post-tenure review; the bill “also has new specifics DeSantis hadn’t proposed, such as a ban on gender studies as a major or minor.” The bill is expected to pass in some form, and an expert opined it “could better pass legal muster than last year’s “Stop&hellip;",

    "content": "Elections are complex undertakings with thousands of moving parts (in the best of circumstances). Some policymakers are now looking to double election complexity and cost of while also undermining security and creating a lot of confusion. The biggest risk for election administration chaos comes from the Supreme Court’s pending ruling on the Independent State Legislature Theory in the Moore v. Harper case. If the Supreme Court endorses the theory, it could lead to a bifurcated system of election administration that would force states to run separate and simultaneous elections for state and federal offices. The case may be mooted this month if the North Carolina Supreme Court overrules the underlying case. The question is a legal grey area, and we may not know the outcome for some time. Even if the Supreme Court does not endorse the theory, an emerging trend in state legislatures could result in equally damaging consequences for elections. State Legislative Efforts on Bifurcation on the Rise Since 2020, five states have introduced legislation that would separate federal and state elections: Missouri, Texas, and Oklahoma this year and New Hampshire and Alaska in the 2021-22 legislative session. These efforts claim to create state sovereignty over election processes and insulate state elections from federal oversight and intervention. Alaska and Oklahoma went as far as to title their legislation as “Election Sovereignty Acts.” Running two separate but simultaneous elections with different rules would create widespread confusion for voters, dramatically increase costs of administering elections, and could make it easier for bad actors to exploit complexity and spread misinformation. The impetus behind this nascent trend appears to be based on unwarranted fears that the federal government will nationalize elections. Texas Representative Mike Schofield proclaimed, “Congress has the right to set the time, place, and manner of their elections, but not for ours.” And, Alaska Senator Mike Shower offered this statement in committee when his bill was being heard, “If the federal government nationalizes the election system, undermining the long tradition of mutual cooperation, or worse, the sovereign rights of a state to manage its internal election affairs, then Alaska should simply tell the federal government to run their own election, bifurcating the election process.” As efforts encouraging Congress to act on voting rights legislation continue, and efforts to institute proof of citizenship expand in states, attempts by state legislatures to bifurcate elections may increase. Bifurcation Undermines Free and Fair Elections Uniform rules for election administration mitigate confusion, improve election administration, and ensure voters are treated equitability. A bifurcated system creates two separate and unequal sets of rules, one for state elections and one for federal elections, complicating and burdening the election administration ecosystem. BPC’s report, Independent State Legislature Theory Undermines Elections Principles, highlighted some of the potential implications of bifurcation: Cost and complexity. Bifurcation would necessitate two distinct ballots for each voter and potentially additional accommodations, doubling costs, and complexity. Election administrators already must divert valuable resources to increase communication to voters amidst rising disinformation. Funding for state and federal&hellip;",

Based on this modeling, the tool below allows users to adjust various parameters of a proposed system of flexible federal block grants to states. Notes: New Federal Block Grant Funding for RDFs and Affordability: The user can specify the size of the annual maximum federal investment in flexible block grants (ranging from $1 billion to $10 billion). Federal Dollars Received Per Dollar of New State Spending: The user can adjust the ratio of the match provided by the federal government on any new state spending (ranging from $0.50 on the dollar to $8 on the dollar). Goal Size of State RDF: The user can set the target size of the RDFs to a percentage of the highest recent annual state spending on higher education (ranging from 10% to 30%). Higher targets will take longer to reach but will provide more cushion in an economic downturn. Rate of Return on RDF: The user can specify the estimated rate of return on investments held by the RDFs (ranging from 4% to 8%). Assuming greater investment returns reduces the amount of time required to fill the RDFs. Federal Contribution to RDF: The user can adjust the percentage of the federal funds that are directed to fill the RDFs. State Contribution to RDF: As above for the federal contribution, the user can adjust the percentage of new state funds that are directed to fill the RDFs.

One vital goal of this new initiative should be to prepare states to weather future economic downturns so that support for higher education affordability is not lost to recession-driven budget cuts. BPC proposes using a flexible federal block grant program that would split funding between new affordability dollars and rainy day funds that would automatically fill gaps in state budgets caused by a recession. Such an approach raises policy design questions about the rainy day funds: how large do they need to be? How quickly could they be filled? Should funds be drawn solely from federal block grant funds or also from state matching dollars? BPC’s new rainy day fund modeling and interactive tool sheds light on these questions.

    "content": "The crypto industry endured much turmoil in 2022, ushering in close congressional scrutiny of the industry. Major bankruptcies included FTX, the Celsius Network, and BlockFi. The collapse of FTX was especially noteworthy and resulted in high-profile hearings in both the House and Senate, as well as criminal investigations. While crypto proponents and skeptics are divided on the value of cryptocurrencies, policymakers from across the political spectrum have indicated their strong desire to act in some fashion. The 118th Congress, in just its first two months, has set a steady pace of activity. The Senate followed up on congressional hearings late last year on the implosion of FTX with a hearing focused on safeguards for digital assets. Meanwhile, the House set up the Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion Subcommittee and held its first hearing to investigate digital assets. While the path forward for Congress is unclear, any legislation will require bipartisan support given Republican control of the House and Democratic control of the Senate. Some Major Issues and Relevant Legislation Legislation from the previous Congress can be a helpful guide in determining what the Congress will do this year, and what issues they will focus on. Two major crypto bills from the last Congress were the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) and the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), but there were also several smaller bills introduced that are likely to be reintroduced again this Congress. Based on these bills, several issues seem likely to reemerge this Congress. Regulation and the Security Versus Commodity Debate Significant debates exist around whether a crypto asset should be classified as a security or commodity as well as the appropriate regulatory role of the SEC and CFTC. If a crypto asset is deemed a security, the SEC would have broad jurisdiction over its regulation. If a crypto asset is deemed a commodity, it would be regulated as a commodity and in part by the CFTC (more discussion on regulatory gaps later in this blog). The crypto industry generally prefers crypto assets to be deemed commodities and have the CFTC as a regulator, while crypto industry critics generally prefer crypto assets to be designated as securities and regulated by the SEC. Under existing law, regulators and courts can use the Howey test (set by the Supreme Court) to determine if a crypto asset is a security. The test has been used by the SEC to make that determination, but critics have suggested the agency has provided the crypto industry with inadequate guidance on its interpretation of the Howey test. Many debate whether existing law is well-designed for crypto assets or needs to be modified or clarified by Congress. For instance, former Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) argues “Given the novel nature of these tokens, Congress ought to step in to provide clarity…. crypto tokens have varying degrees of decentralization, usually do not have a financial claim on the issuer, and typically can be settled in real-time without intermediaries. These are important differences from traditional securities. And&hellip;",

    "content": "“Well, does that constitute publishing?&#8230; I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re drawing the line.”— Justice Samuel Alito, Oral Arguments for GONZALEZ v. GOOGLE LLC, February 21, 2023 Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and “content moderation”— the removal of harmful user content from online platforms – have become important policy debates in recent years. Should social media platforms be regulated like newspapers, bookstores, or phone companies? Each of these analogies compare different bodies of law, but online platforms do not fit neatly into traditional communication categories. Social media platforms may be neither a publisher nor a distributor. This post navigates these nuances because how courts and lawmakers address Section 230 could fundamentally change the future of the internet. Overview In the 1990s, at the dawn of the internet, a court in Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc. found that an online messaging board was a passive distributor of content rather than a publisher. A few years later in Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., another court ruled differently—that an online bulletin board was liable as a publisher because their automatic software screening program constituted ‘editorial control.’ These conflicting rulings posed a unique predicament: were internet service providers (ISPs) considered publishers or distributors? This distinction was important because, historically, publishers and distributors faced different liability standards. Voilà—this led to Section 230’s creation. Section 230(c)(1): states, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Section 230’s legal protections were created to encourage the innovation of the internet by preventing an influx of lawsuits for user content. Fast forward: the internet has grown into a thriving place to learn, connect, and share ideas—a vibrant and competitive free market. Internet businesses, like Apple and Microsoft, have grown into some of the world&#8217;s biggest and most powerful companies. Section 230 has been the target of increasing public scrutiny over the last few years. When originally enacted, Congress could not have fathomed the internet as we know it today, and there are concerns that the digital environment is a lawless land with no accountability or oversight. As policymakers, advocates, academics, and industry experts attempt to address the question of Section 230 reform, an accurate understanding of how liability laws work is required to understand this legal debate. Differences between Publisher, Distributor, and Internet Service Provider Liability Let’s dive deeper into 3 types of legal liability for content providers: What About the First Amendment? The Section 230 debate is often entangled with questions about a user’s right to free speech online. There seems to be a broad misunderstanding about what is and isn’t protected by the First Amendment. The First Amendment prohibits the government from interfering with free speech, but it also protects the rights of private businesses to exercise editorial discretion. Both the Constitution and Section 230 protect social media companies to moderate content how they see fit, and the government cannot force them to suppress or remove&hellip;",

    "content": "Policymakers have until December 31, 2024, to decide which pandemic-era telehealth policies should remain in place for Medicare beneficiaries. To aid policymakers in weighing these decisions, BPC created a telehealth spending estimator tool. This tool allows users to estimate Medicare’s telehealth spending over the next three years based on various policy decisions. For example, the tool can estimate how much Medicare can expect to spend on telehealth services if telehealth continues to be reimbursed at parity with in-person services. Also, the tool allows users to make different policy decisions about the future of tele-primary care services, behavioral health care, and specialty care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare allowed all beneficiaries, regardless of medical condition or geographic location, to access telehealth appointments from home and with any provider. Pre-pandemic, telehealth access was mostly limited to beneficiaries living in rural areas and patients were required to travel to designated sites for care. To ensure people could still access care during the pandemic, Medicare removed established patient requirements for telehealth services, began reimbursing health care providers the same for telehealth and in-person visits, and freely allowed the use of audio-only telehealth, or telehealth services without live video. The cost of telehealth services is merely one consideration in developing evidence-based federal policy for the effective use of telehealth. Policymakers must balance often-competing goals, including maintaining program costs, patient access to care, and quality outcomes. This tool can help policymakers understand the estimated cost of telehealth services for the Medicare program associated with their policy decisions.

    "content": "When the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) passed in November 2021, it represented a historic investment in America’s infrastructure. It promised more than $1 trillion in transportation, energy, water, and broadband projects over the next few years. While funds are flowing as expected, the current debate over raising the debt limit is causing infrastructure stakeholders to wonder how long that will continue. By way of background, the debt limit is a statutory cap on the amount of debt the U.S. Treasury can issue to generate the cash needed to pay the government’s bills. Currently, the limit is $31.4 trillion. The debt limit covers both debt issued to the public and debt held in other government accounts. When Treasury gets close to the debt limit, it can delay payments to the government accounts in order to continue issuing debt to the public, in a step known as “extraordinary measures.” Treasury began using extraordinary measures on January 19. The debt limit has regularly been raised over the years, though at times the debate on increasing it got uncomfortably close to the X date, i.e. the date at which Treasury exhausts its ability to use extraordinary measures to continue paying the bills. BPC currently projects the X date will fall sometime this summer or early fall. If we reach that point without an increase in the debt limit, Treasury would no longer be able to raise enough cash to fully cover its daily needs. What would happen next is the subject of much speculation and little certainty, as the U.S. has never crossed the X date before. One potential, though untested, possibility is that Treasury could prioritize payments by choosing to make some payments before others, or by waiting until it has enough cash for a full day of payments before making that day’s payments, thereby delaying payments for the following days. Taking such steps could create significant challenges for those who rely on federal payments, from individuals to businesses to state and local governments, with adverse ripple effects throughout the economy. Impacts on Infrastructure Programs from Crossing the X Date Most BIL programs provide grants to states, localities, tribal governments, and other recipients, paid for with general revenues of the U.S. Treasury. If the X date is crossed, these programs would likely be subject to the same negative impacts as other government programs, whether that is some form of prioritization or another approach, leading to the possibility that federal payments to BIL grant recipients could be delayed. The impact on infrastructure projects currently underway could range from minor to significant, depending on the duration of the delays, other resources available to project sponsors, and related economic disruptions. Most federal grants are reimbursable, which means that project sponsors spend their own money first and are reimbursed by the federal government. In the case of federal funding delays, project sponsors could choose to stop work until federal funding became more certain, though they would incur the additional costs that come with ramping projects up and&hellip;",

    "content": "A new poll conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the Bipartisan Policy Center found that American voters recognize increased access to highly skilled legal immigration as a key element to growing the economy and bolstering U.S. competitiveness. Moreover, many believe that the long waits faced by some immigrants for employment-based green cards are too long, limiting the effectiveness of the immigration system in reaching these goals. While the political debate over immigration continues, Americans’ perspectives on the issue continue to shift. Recent Gallup polling suggests that Americans are increasingly concerned about immigration, with only 28% of Americans being satisfied with the level of immigration to the United States. However, another poll of Republican voters by the American Principles Project shows that while immigration is the number two issue for these voters, a majority of them (59%) also support comprehensive immigration reform legislation with a pathway to citizenship. These competing views highlight the challenge in reforming the immigration system. And yet, the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act last Congress, and increasing concerns over economic and technological competition with China, have spotlighted the need for skilled workers to support national economic and security goals. However, the immigration system continues to create challenges for high-skilled immigrants to stay in the U.S., making it difficult to use it to address concerns over both global competitiveness and long-standing worries about whether the U.S. has a sufficient number of skilled workers, especially in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. To learn more about American voters’ perspectives on high-skilled immigration to the United States, BPC partnered with Morning Consult to survey a national sample of 2,006 registered voters. The survey was conducted December 10-15, 2022, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2%. Top Six Takeaways Immigration is top of mind for the typical American voter. 77% of voters view immigration as very important (42%) or somewhat important (35%) to them personally. This includes 71% of Democrats, 73% of independents and 88% of Republicans. A supermajority of American voters support high-skilled immigration, even more than immigration generally. 76% of voters strongly support (40%) or somewhat support (36%) highly skilled people coming to live and work in the United States, including 85% of Democrats, 74% of independents, and 68% of Republicans. Support is somewhat lower but still strong for immigration broadly. Specifically, 62% of voters somewhat (35%) or strongly (27%) support immigrants coming to live and work in the United States. This includes 77% of Democrats, 64% of independents and 45% of Republicans. While voters are less sure about the impact of immigrants generally on the economy, a majority believes that highly skilled immigrants help the economy. 56% of voters think that highly-skilled immigrants help the United States economy, while only 16% think they hurt the economy. Similarly, 57% of voters think that increasing high-skilled employment-based immigration would positively impact the economy, while 42% of voters say increasing employment-based immigration generally would have a positive impact on the economy. 56%&hellip;",

    "content": "Hydrogen can be an important tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors and reaching net-zero by 2050. Hydrogen can serve as a low- or zero-carbon fuel for transportation and industrial end uses, feedstock for industrial chemical and critical products, and in power production and energy storage, all while producing no emissions. To reap these decarbonizing benefits and enable a new clean economy, current production of hydrogen has to shift to cleaner pathways at an affordable price tag. See BPC’s factsheet to understand the available hydrogen production pathways and end-uses. Over the past two years, the federal government has been busy delivering key policies to accelerate the scale-up and deployment of clean hydrogen. More specifically: Scaling-up clean hydrogen economy through regional federal investments. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) made a catalytic regional investment of $8 billion to demonstrate and deploy clean hydrogen production at scale by connecting suppliers and end-users with connective infrastructure. The funding announcement for the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program was released last year, and the Department of Energy recently provided encouragement to 33 potential applicants who submitted concept papers to proceed to full applications due on April 7, 2023. Accelerating key clean hydrogen production technologies through federal incentives. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created the first-ever incentive for clean hydrogen production, providing up to $3 of credit for every kilogram of hydrogen produced meeting a carbon intensity threshold. The IRA also contained other complementary incentives for clean electricity production, carbon capture and storage, and clean vehicle tax credits. The Treasury Department guidance to implement these tax credits is expected by August 2023. Supporting clean hydrogen research and innovation through federal appropriation. The recently passed bipartisan 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill provided DOE’s multi-office crosscutting hydrogen research efforts a total of $316 million for fiscal year 2023. This includes R&amp;D projects and activities covering hydrogen production, delivery, and end-use performed by universities, national laboratories, and industry. A bipartisan Congress also supported innovation in hydrogen production and end use pathways by providing R&amp;D funding for: Low-carbon and low-cost hydrogen research including: $100 million for the H2@Scale initiative which advances R&amp;D efforts to bring down the emission and cost of hydrogen production. $121 million for solid oxide fuel cell hydrogen production, transportation, storage, and end-use. $30 million for fuel cell technologies for different end-uses.

    "content": "Despite being designated critical infrastructure in 2017, federal investment in elections is irregular, unpredictable, and insufficient. Federal funding for elections typically takes place through grants appropriated by Congress and dispersed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. The Department of Homeland Security yesterday departed from business as usual, announcing a new $2 billion fiscal year 2023 grant program to support preparedness against acts of terrorism in high-risk areas, including elections. Election administration is chronically underfunded, and BPC applauds the DHS for designating $30 million for election security in an acknowledgement of the critical role election administration plays in homeland security. These new funds can be used to shore up election offices’ physical and cybersecurity amidst rising threats from both here at home and abroad. We wish there was more of it so all jurisdictions could benefit. This grant program is another example of the kind of stopgap elections funding that is often too little, too late to meaningfully improve security. At worst, it risks becoming a short-term band-aid that makes it easier for Congress to avoid allocating the predictable, long-term funding that elections really need. The DHS grants require that State Homeland Security and Urban Area Security grant recipients dedicate at least 3% of their awards to election security, in theory creating $30,900,000 of new, dedicated election security funds. Previous federal grant programs—such as the Department of Justice’s Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program—have been expanded to elections without a requirement that they reach election offices, meaning they are in competition with other high-priority public services like police departments and fire to receive funding. The Bipartisan Policy Center has three concerns with the new DHS grant program that will limit impactful improvements for all American voters: $30 million is not enough. Amounting to less than $1 million per state, this funding is but a drop in the bucket of what it would cost to sustainably shore up election security. Equipment upgrades, physical and cybersecurity improvements to offices, and threat tracking and response alone can cost states millions of dollars to implement and millions more to operate in any given year. Long-term, predictable funding is needed. Unpredictable, one-time infusions of federal support make it nearly impossible for state and local administrators to invest in the kind of long-term equipment, security, and process improvements that are needed to mitigate trans-jurisdictional threats. Long-term funding needs to come from Congress, though we acknowledge and appreciate that the DHS is filling an ever-broadening resource gap created by their failure to act. While this funding is inadequate, congressional support can work in tandem with DHS grants. For example, because HAVA grants are limited to election-specific projects, whole office projects don’t always meet the standard for funding. DHS grants could fill this gap by providing for whole office security improvements, while long-term federal funding could cover the long-term operational costs of election administration. Both are needed to protect elections. Jurisdictions that need funding the most are unlikely to get it. Applying for and complying with grant&hellip;",

    "content": "Today, February 28, is the 40th anniversary of the “M*A*S*H” finale which was watched by a record 105.9 million viewers. The show, a subversive antiwar spinoff of the dark comedic film of the same name, evolved into a rare unifying program beloved by people—and presidents—on both sides of the aisle. Set in the Korean War, the show was really a critique of America’s involvement in Vietnam. It was clearly a liberal show, and its lead actors, including Alan Alda (Hawkeye Pierce) and Mike Farrell (BJ Hunnicutt), were unabashed leftists, but the show never became so strident that it lost its appeal to Americans of all stripes, with nine of its last 10 seasons finishing in the top 10 most watched shows. This cross-party appeal can be seen in both Democrat and Republican presidents’ reactions to the show. In 1985, two years after the finale, Ronald Reagan praised Harry Morgan for his volunteer work as well as his acting skills, noting that it was his “‘M*A*S*H” performance as Colonel Potter—irascible, lovable Colonel Potter—for which I suspect you will be best remembered.” In February of 2000, Bill Clinton used “M*A*S*H” as an indication of how things had changed over the last 25 years. Clinton contrasted the top shows of 1975, including “M*A*S*H” and “All in the Family,” with the new era in which there were now over 50 million “webpages on the World Wide Web.” Republicans looked to “M*A*S*H” as well, as George W. Bush’s Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Hagin told the New York Times’ Elizabeth Bumiller that Bush’s personal aide Blake Gottesman was like “M*A*S*H” character Radar O’Reilly in his ability to anticipate what the president was likely to want before he wanted it. Barack Obama probably liked “M*A*S*H” more than any other president. Farrell once tried to introduce himself to the president, prompting Obama to respond, “No, no, no. I know who you are. I learned many of my values from watching your show.” In 2012, when asked by a younger couple in Minneapolis about his favorite TV show, Obama said, “You know what pops into my head? I&#8217;m older than you, so you won&#8217;t remember, but it&#8217;s a show called ‘M*A*S*H.’” Obama’s mention of the age differential is telling, as “M*A*S*H” is largely unknown to the current generation. Its jokes have not held up well, and Hawkeye’s leering behavior toward female nurses would mortify the post #MeToo generation. Future presidents will probably never have seen it. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, was about 5 when it went off the air. But “M*A*S*H” is worth remembering as one of the last shows that could unite the nation, engage in political humor without alienating large swaths of the American people, and mock the military even as it celebrated and honored the heroes who served in it. It’s for these reasons that “M*A*S*H” was once a touchstone for presidents, and for the nation.",

    "content": "The Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) together have made historic investments in America’s clean energy future and help fast-track the country towards achieving climate goals. The IIJA, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, makes critical infrastructure investments to scale and accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions in the transportation, power, and industrial sectors. The IRA provides incentives to close the cost-gap and support faster deployment of clean energy solutions. As these policies are implemented, it’s important to consider ways to ensure these federal dollars benefit all Americans, particularly because of how past disparities have negatively impacted certain communities. For example, households of color pay two to three times more for energy than the national average, low-income Americans and communities of color are disproportionately exposed to harmful air pollutants associated with power production, and access to clean energy sources for communities of color lags behind the national average. The Bipartisan Policy Center and the American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) wrote an explainer about the challenges and opportunities to ensure that the benefits of clean energy investments flow equitably to historically disadvantaged Americans, and lawmakers took notice. During a January 2023 House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) asked to submit the report into the record and asked witnesses, “Can you discuss how clean energy investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act will help build a more equitable economy?” The ongoing challenges of equitable implementation of clean energy policy and infrastructure investment was the focus of an all-day discussion at AABE’s Energy Policy Summit held in December 2022. Panelists from non-profit organizations, the private sector, and government agencies spoke about the once-in-a-generation opportunity the IIJA and IRA provide for Black Americans and other communities of color and the tangible ways the public and private sector can enable the realization of benefits. Here are four key takeaways from the summit: Readying historically underserved communities for the influx of funding. As public laws and multi-year investments, the IIJA and IRA will require many steps to implement before delivering impactful services or benefits to communities. Panelists discussed how this procedural time ought to be utilized to build proper anticipation and prepare communities to capitalize on the flow of funds and investments. Private sector actors, advocacy groups, and non-profit organizations can help create proper anticipation by informing communities about incoming opportunities. Panelists encouraged federal agencies to ready communities by increasing transparency and communication about program implementation timelines and funding opportunities, forming and expanding new and existing technical assistance programs, standing up public participation offices, and strengthening coordination with local governmental and non-governmental actors. Both public and private actors can also ensure that communities of color or historically disadvantaged communities are aware of the various tools provided by the federal government, like the Climate and Economic Justice tool and community benefits plan, to ensure impactful investments are coming to their neighborhood.

    "content": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) purchases, renewing and modifying the existing tax credit. EV sales substantially increased their market share in recent years, rising from 3.2% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2021 to 5.8% in 2022. The Biden administration hopes to continue that trend by setting a target to make zero-emissions vehicles half of all new vehicles sold in 2030. The administration views tax credits as an important tool to encourage EV purchases because, while buyers save on the cost of fuel, EVs typically cost more than non-electric vehicles due to the high cost of producing EV batteries. Requirements for Vehicle Components and Assembly Manufacturing EVs and their batteries is a complex process involving several stages of production that can each take place in different countries. The IRA includes three sets of requirements related to vehicle components and assembly for EV models to qualify for tax credits, with the intention of bolstering domestic production. Assembly in North America: As part of the IRA, final assembly of electric vehicle models must occur in North America to be eligible, effective immediately after the enactment of the legislation. Critical minerals and battery components: To qualify for the full $7,500 credit, vehicles must meet two sets of standards related to their vehicle components. If a vehicle only meets one of these two requirements, it qualifies for a $3,750 tax credit. 50% of the value of battery components must be produced or manufactured in North America in fiscal year 2023, with the minimum percentage increasing annually. 40% of the value of critical minerals used for the vehicle must be extracted, processed, and/or recycled domestically or in a country the U.S. has a free trade agreement with, with the minimum percentage increasing annually. EV manufacturing requires a range of minerals, including cobalt, copper, nickel, graphite, and lithium. However, the Department of Treasury announced it will need until March 2023 to develop guidance for the critical mineral and battery component requirements, including which countries are considered free trade partners and what activities are considered battery component manufacturing. As a result, these provisions have not been in effect as of February—a delay that invited criticism from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). Entities of concern: Starting in 2024, vehicles with any battery components manufactured or assembled in an “entity of concern” are not eligible for the tax credit. Beginning in 2025, vehicles with critical minerals extracted, processed, or recycled by entities of concern will not qualify. Nations of concern include China and Russia. Notably, requirements for final assembly in North America as well as battery and critical mineral requirements do not apply for the commercial clean vehicles tax credit. Potential Impact of Domestic Requirements The congressional intent of the domestic EV content and manufacturing requirements was to support jobs, grow the economy, and protect national security while building energy independence. Beyond just their use in EVs, diversifying critical mineral supply chains, creating increased domestic sources, and insulating&hellip;",

    "content": "As the nation prays for Jimmy Carter and continues to appreciate his legacy, it’s meaningful to note that no Democratic president has died since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1973. As of this writing, all the Democratic presidents since then—Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden—are still alive. Should Carter pass, his funeral would be the first for a Democratic president in half a century. Carter’s death would also be noteworthy in another way. Lyndon Johnson was also the last Democratic president in office during a state funeral for a deceased president, that of John F. Kennedy following his assassination in 1963, which in turn elevated Johnson to the presidency. When Richard Nixon died in 1994 during the Clinton presidency, it was at his own request that there was no traditional state funeral, opting instead for a more modest ceremony at his own presidential library. This choice may have reflected Nixon’s discomfort with the circumstances of his departure from the presidency, as he remains the only president to resign from office. Nixon’s choice highlights a strange dichotomy of presidential funerals. On one hand, tradition and protocol heavily govern the funerals, while on the other hand, the president’s personal preferences are carefully considered. This planning actually begins during a president’s tenure as the U.S. Army Military District of Washington, which is in charge of presidential funerals, meets with a president early in a presidential term to discuss their desired arrangements. Admittedly, this is a somewhat morbid topic to take on while running the free world, and not necessarily considering the circumstances surrounding one’s demise. The president’s wishes remain a carefully guarded secret, made public only following their death. These instructions can be quite detailed: George H.W. Bush’s were laid out in a 211-page document revealed after his death in 2018. Even though this process allows presidents to express their preferences, there remains a degree of protocol for funerals. The sitting president is expected to announce the presidential passing and issue an executive order closing the federal government on the day designated as the National Day of Mourning for the former president. Other common traditions include keeping flags at half-staff for 30 days and an expected five-day state funeral. Most presidents select their home states for burial and Carter is likely to follow suit in selecting his native Georgia as his final resting place. However, two presidents—John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft— were laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. When a former president dies, many expect the deceased president’s body to lie in state—a tradition in which the body of a deceased official is placed in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda to allow the public to pay their respects—but there have been variations with the passing of former presidents. Gerald Ford, for example, requested that his body lie in the chambers of both the U.S. House and Senate, to reflect his long service in the House as well as his time as president of the Senate, a position he held as the vice&hellip;",

    "content": "Farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners in every region of the country engage with Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs to support a broad range of beneficial conservation practices to improve their working lands. These programs are locally driven, voluntary, and offer financial incentives directly to producers for practices like restoring farmland damaged by natural disasters and emergency water conservation in severe drought. It&#8217;s no secret that these programs are popular—thousands of farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, and other private landowners benefit from these programs every year. But the extent to which demand exceeds supply is eye opening. In Montana, for example, only one producer receives funding for every three who apply, according to Montana Farmers Union President Walter Schweitzer. The technical and financial assistance provided by these programs can help increase a producers’ yield and strengthen daily operations, while also improving soil health and other natural resources. Four primary USDA conservation programs include: Producers across every state make use of USDA’s conservation programs. Across midwestern states, cover crops, crop rotation, nutrient management, wildlife habitat management, and prescribed grazing are among the most common practices sought out for EQIP funding. In fiscal year 2021, Iowa received the highest number of contracts while Texas had the greatest number of acres enrolled, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. The maps below show the top recipients for FY2021 across the four programs by number of contracts, funds awarded, and total number of acres covered. Data source: Agricultural Conservation: A Guide to Programs (Congressional Research Service) The essential nature of these programs can be seen in the sheer number of applicants each year. In 2021, 2.3 million acres were submitted for consideration by producers to CRP. EQIP and CSP received nearly 115,000 combined applications in the same year but were only able to support a third of these applicants. These programs are routinely oversubscribed and have more applicants than available funding, leaving many producers without critical support. The table below shows the number of applicants, number of applicants accepted, and acceptance rate for each program. An additional 29,116 EQIP applications or 26% of total applicants were deemed to be valid but were not funded, with the highest concentration of these applications in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. USDA’s conservation programs are an important asset for farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners across the country. Conservation practices covered by these programs deliver valuable co-benefits by improving air and water quality, increasing resilience of working lands, and providing an additional revenue stream for producers. But because many of these programs are heavily oversubscribed, we are missing an opportunity to support producers across the country. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Farm and Forest Natural Carbon Solutions Task Force, bringing together key stakeholders across the agriculture and forestry sectors, recommended sustained support for these key voluntary conservation programs in its 2022 report. BPC continues to prioritize maintaining the core structure of these and other Title II conservation programs in the upcoming Farm Bill.",

    "content": "Today, February 21, the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Gonzalez v. Google, a case that could fundamentally change the future of the modern internet. Gonzalez v. Google involves Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act— which has thus far shielded tech platforms from liability for hosting and moderating user content. Section 230 is one of the most important laws in tech policy, and this will be the first time the Supreme Court has interpreted its scope. The court’s ruling on this case could significantly influence online platforms’ abilities to protect their users from harmful content online and their legal protections. As the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Gonzalez v. Google, organizations from across the political spectrum have attempted to influence the court’s decision by filing amicus curiae briefs including here at BPC. Overall, 78 organizations submitted briefs. This research summarizes the main arguments in support of the petitioners (Gonzalez), the respondent (Google LLC), or neither party. We also share which experts were cited most in support of each side, and what this reveals about the arguments in the case. In support of Gonzalez Broad immunity concerns: Many briefs in favor of Gonzalez argue that tech companies should not be immune from liability in every circumstance. For example, some argue that platforms should be held liable when they make editorial judgments to ban opposing political parties’ messages. Many of these briefs explain that tech companies are no longer acting “voluntarily” or “in good faith” to restrict objectionable content as Section 230 requires, and, thus, they are no longer entitled to its liability shield. Meaningful redress rights: Several of these briefs claim the court’s ruling in favor of Google would undermine the rights of Americans to seek appropriate redress for illicit or harmful acts committed online. They contend that Section 230 prevents citizens from adequately holding companies accountable for injuries caused by information circulated online and from obtaining compensation for these wrongs. Many of these arguments favor narrower interpretations of publisher immunity to grant consumers more opportunities to seek legal recourse. Child safety: The arguments in support of Gonzalez also prioritize interpretations of Section 230 that are consistent with one of Congress&#8217; original intents to protect children from harmful content online. These briefs support giving child victims and parents an avenue to hold technology companies accountable for harms incurred online. Algorithm concerns: Additionally, these briefs argue that Section 230 should not immunize internet service providers when they create and profit from recommendation systems that entice users to engage with unlawful, violent, and harmful content. They also argue that the lower court’s expansive interpretation of publisher immunity under Section 230 (i.e., that immunity encompasses online recommendation algorithms) makes it more difficult to hold social media companies accountable for the harm their products inflict on people. Furthermore, the briefs claim the scope of immunity granted for “traditional publications” should not extend to content that is recommended to specific users.

    "content": "Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) announced yesterday that he will undergo treatment for clinical depression requiring hospitalization, potentially for weeks. The Bipartisan Policy Center extends its best wishes for the senator’s treatment. However long it lasts, his absence might disrupt Senate business, particularly for three of his committee assignments: Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; and Environment and Public Works (Sen. Fetterman’s other assignments—the Joint Economic Committee and the Special Committee on Aging—have no legislative authority). Sen. Fetterman isn’t the first to need to step away from the upper chamber for health reasons. As BPC has previously noted, “the Senate has several strategies available in accordance with rules and precedents to compensate for an absent member.” These include processing business by unanimous consent, proxy voting (limited to committees), and pairing votes. This issue was especially relevant in the last Congress when the Senate was split 50-50 and any absence had the potential to delay or derail legislative business. Last Congress, though, the Senate also had special rules in place to smooth the functioning of the chamber given the even split. Those special rules expired at the end of the 117th Congress, making any absence more precarious for Senate Democrats, who hold a 51-49 majority in the 118th Congress. Committee Considerations for Absent Senators Most Senate committees, including Sen. Fetterman’s, are currently divided with a one-seat majority for Democrats. Consequently, those committees will be divided evenly between the parties in his absence. Proxy voting remains available in committees, but may not be as useful as Democrats might hope. Senate Rule XXVI allows each committee to provide its own rules for the casting of proxy votes, provided that: Absent senators must be notified about the question to be decided and he or she has requested that his or her vote be cast by proxy. Committees may prohibit proxy votes from being cast on votes to report a measure or nomination to the full Senate. If a committee allows proxy votes to be cast on a motion to report, votes by proxy cannot be decisive in ordering the measure or nomination reported, except to prevent it. If these committees consider a measure or nomination while Sen. Fetterman is absent and the vote ties along party lines, his proxy vote cannot be the deciding one to report the matter to the full Senate. Without bipartisan agreement, legislation and nominations could be stalled in these three committees, potentially including President Biden’s replacement for Lael Brainard on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, which is under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. Last Congress, under S. Res. 27, the power-sharing agreement for the 50-50 Senate, tied votes in committees could be overcome using a discharge procedure, which allowed Senate leaders to bring the measure or nomination to the floor in cases where a majority of a committee did not support doing so. The same was true for committee chairmen who could discharge measures from subcommittees to the full committee in these cases. These extraordinary&hellip;",

    "content": "Working families who claim the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) might be surprised when their IRS tax refund is lower than last year. What is the CDCTC? The CDCTC is a tax credit designed to help working families afford the high cost of child care so that parents can look for work and stay employed. This credit allows working parents to claim up to $6,000 in child care expenses for two children. Eligible families receive 20-35% of claimed expenses as a non-refundable credit. Why Are Rates Lower in 2023? The American Rescue Plan included a temporary expansion of the CDCTC for eligible families when they filed their taxes in 2021. Below is a summary of the changes made under the ARP expansion. Changes under the ARP expansion were a first step towards making the credit equitable. Now that it has expired, we are back at square one. Now that these changes have expired, working families may receive a smaller credit. Because the credit is nonrefundable, lower-income families without tax liability are not able to receive the CDCTC. It also has been shown to provide larger benefits to higher income families, in part because those with lower incomes spend less on child care throughout the year and therefore have less to apply to this credit on their annual taxes. . Calculate the Difference See how much you could receive under the CDCTC by using our calculator below. For more on what expenses might count, and for other FAQ’s, please view the IRS website on this topic. Families are impacted differently by these changes depending on the number of children they have, the amount they spend on child care, and their income. Why Does This Matter? Even though pandemic-era funding has ended, the child care affordability crisis has not. The U.S. Department of Labor recently released the most comprehensive study of child care prices in the nation to date. They found that the price for child care can range from $5,357 to $17,171, depending on location and type of care. The average cost of care in some regions would comprise up to 19.3% of median family income. The study found that increases in median child care prices were associated with lower maternal employment rates. Instead of reverting back to a flawed tax credit, we need to build off the American Rescue Plan’s temporary expansion and further support working families. There are several key changes that can help make the credit work for the families who need it most: Make the credit fully refundable. This is the single most effective way to ensure the lowest-income families receive the CDCTC. Consider significantly enhancing the credit rate for the lowest-earning families but phase out the rate for higher-income families. If the credit is fully refundable, this rate enhancement will yield higher credits for low-income working families without providing additional benefits to the families that can already afford child care. Ensure that changes (1) and (2) above coincide with a CTC that is calculated&hellip;",

    "content": "The Flathead Reservation in northwestern Montana, home to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, spans 1.2 million acres. Like many families living in rural areas, those living on the reservation often lack access to affordable, quality child care. However, the shortage of child care on the Flathead is exacerbated by systematic underfunding of federal programs for tribes compounded with high rates of poverty. The child care gap on the reservation, meaning the percent of young children with working parents that lack access to formal child care, is 46.5%. That is 1.4 times the national average. In October 2022, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Early Childhood Initiative sat down with parents, teachers, and leaders on the Flathead Reservation to hear from them about the reservation’s child care crisis. As the final webinar in our four-part series focusing on tribal child care, we featured our documentary Righting a Wrong: Closing the Gap in Child Care for Native American Families. The documentary showcases the Salish Kootenai College (SKC) Early Learning Center and the impact it has on the families it serves and the community at-large. The SKC Early Learning Center enables Native American parents to work and continue their education with the peace of mind that their children are in a quality environment. For Gail Crawford, an SKC student and parent, this child care center meant the difference between dropping out of school and working towards her bachelor’s degree. Last year she told us, “Without them, I probably wouldn’t be as far as I am in my education, especially at SKC. I probably would’ve given up.” Unfortunately, this early learning center can only serve a handful of the hundreds of children and working parents living on or near the reservation. Tribal Chairman Tom McDonald explains that child care is a “critical unmet need” for working families on the reservation. In their 2023-2025 477 Plan, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes included 2,911 children in their child count, 175 of which receive child care subsidies directly from the tribe. There are only 27 home- and center-based child care providers on the Flathead that accept subsidies. Together, these providers have a total capacity for about 786 children. This leaves over 2,000 children who might benefit from child care or after-school care. Moreover, many of the slots for existing capacity are for preschool-aged children, meaning working parents with infants and toddlers might find it especially challenging to find care. Janet Jolley, the director of the SKC Early Learning Center, explains that the lack of capacity for infant care on the reservation motivated them to open their own infant room in 2021. Child care providers are clustered in Polson, Pablo, St. Ignatius, and Arlee, leaving parents from more remote, and often more affordable, areas of the reservation without access to local providers. SKC student and parent Joni Tobacco drives 90 minutes each way to get to the SKC Early Learning Center. For her family, this was the only way to find both affordable housing and child care.

    "content": "The Department of Education released a proposed rule on January 10 providing details of planned changes to income-driven repayment (IDR) for student loan borrowers. These details closely align with the broad strokes that were announced at the same time as student loan forgiveness in August 2022. The current IDR system is a mixed bag, providing much-needed assistance to some low-income borrowers by helping them avoid default, but its complexity makes it difficult to navigate for many while allowing others to game the system. The proposed rule would make major changes, but they come with a price tag in the hundreds of billions. Limitations on the changes that can be made through executive action also make the proposed rule an incomplete reform of IDR. Bipartisan legislation is needed to streamline IDR, reform other aspects of student loans, and target aid to those most in need. The impact of the proposed changes to the IDR system can be broken down broadly into good, mixed, and bad news. Good news: Simplification: The Department of Education predicts that almost all borrowers in IDR would use the new version of the Revised Pay as You Earn (REPAYE) plan. This would allow the Department to phase out most other IDR plans, simplifying the system. Less paperwork: Borrowers who fall behind on their payments on a standard repayment plan and are in danger of default would be automatically switched to REPAYE if the Department of Education has access to their income information. This would help low-income borrowers avoid default without requiring additional paperwork on their part. Mixed news: Changes for low balances: Borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less would be eligible for full loan forgiveness under REPAYE in only 10 years. This change is designed to help borrowers such as community college students, students who enrolled in shorter credential programs, and those who attended college without completing a credential, all of whom have both less debt and more difficulty repaying on average than someone with a bachelor’s degree. Borrowers with low balances are more likely to default than those with high balances, and so providing those borrowers with faster timelines to forgiveness may help those most in need of assistance. However, student debt accrual is also correlated with race and gender; the likelihood that a borrower’s balance falls above the $12,000 line is higher for women and Black borrowers. Providing faster loan forgiveness to borrowers with less debt may worsen race and gender disparities in the student loan system. This change combined with others could also increase the likelihood that institutions where students currently take on low levels of debt see an opportunity to increase tuition, assuming that loans borrowed to pay that tuition will be forgiven. Ending “debt traps”: Borrowers whose monthly payments do not cover the accrued interest on their loans would have the remaining interest waived rather than added to their balance. This would prevent “debt traps” for borrowers with low incomes, high balances, or both, who would otherwise see their&hellip;",

    "content": "The landscape of small business financing is far from even. Businesses operating in certain economic sectors have more difficulty accessing credit than those in other industries. Younger businesses tend to be deemed higher credit risks than older, more mature companies. Most concerning, different types of business owners—irrespective of differences in wealth, experience, credit score, or skill—enjoy greater access to financing than others. There are several facts about demographic disparities in small business financing that, unfortunately, have persisted across decades and been the object of many public and private remediation efforts. Yet they endure. Financing gaps exist between men and women as well as among racial and ethnic groups. This brief focuses mostly on the latter. Multiple Financing Gaps Demographic differences in small business financing occur across nearly every stage of a company’s evolution. At business start—Black- and Hispanic-owned businesses start their businesses with less overall capital than white-owned businesses. In part, research has found, this is because they rely disproportionately on personal and family savings rather than outside credit. This “persistent difference in funding is driven primarily by differences in the amount of bank loans and other bank credit products, which in turn are not substituted by other sources of capital.” Black entrepreneurs raise a smaller amount of bank credit when starting their business than white entrepreneurs and are unable to close the gap with other sources. In credit products sought and credit sources used—According to census data, Black business owners have been more likely to use credit cards for business financing. In 2019, according to the Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS), Black business owners had higher application rates for business loans, government-guaranteed loans, and personal loans for business purposes. Black business owners have also been more likely to apply for credit at online lenders and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). Similarly, in 2021, women-owned businesses were more likely to apply for credit at online lenders and CDFIs than those owned by men. (This excludes emergency relief programs.) In credit received—Business owners of color experience higher rates of denial when applying for credit and, when they do receive credit, usually receive less than the amount sought. Lower loan approval rates hold true even when researchers control for sector, credit score, wealth, and other factors. In 2020, excluding emergency relief programs, Black business owners reported the lowest rate (72%) of receiving all or some of the credit they requested. Rates were higher for whites (82%), Hispanics (77%), and Asians (74%). Likewise, women business owners are “more likely to report being rejected for loans or lines of credit. The higher application rates for credit products observed in the figure above may appear to indicate an absence of financing gaps. Yet they are related to the greater difficulty Black and Hispanic business owners experience in accessing external credit, which is partly why these owners have a higher likelihood of “seeking new funding relationships.” Gaps in access to credit access lead Black and Hispanic business owners to apply for credit at more places and&hellip;",

    "content": "The federal government plays a large role in the market for small business credit. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) estimated that, in 2019, the outstanding balance of small business credit supported and extended by the government was around $200 billion. This estimate included programs such as the 7(a) loan guaranty at the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Farm Credit System. It did not include programs such as the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), through which $10 billion is being provided to states to stimulate private sector lending and investment. The CFPB’s estimate also did not include standalone efforts by state and local governments: “the Bureau estimates that there are likely over 100 government small business lending programs” across the country. Yet the small business credit market is quite large. The CFPB’s total market estimate, in terms of the value of outstanding balances, was $1.2 trillion in 2019. Government programs thus account for about one-sixth of that total. On an annual basis, SBA’s 7(a) program helps originate no more than 10% of new credit provision for small businesses. This explainer looks at the reasons for government involvement in small business lending, trends in the largest programs, and its effects. Justification for Government Intervention There has been longstanding concern among policymakers and small business advocates about “credit rationing” because of the challenges in lending to them. Small businesses “don’t have as much publicly available, transparent information for lenders,” leading to a dearth of “standardized, quantitative criteria” for assessing creditworthiness. Small businesses are frequently said to be “informationally opaque.” Even sophisticated lenders “have had difficulty determining the creditworthiness of applicants for small business loans. The heterogeneity across small firms, together with widely varying uses of borrowed funds, has impeded the development of general standards for assessing applications for small business loans and has made evaluating such loans relatively expensive.” Even when a bank, for example, has insight into a prospective small business borrower’s accounts, there is considerable “fluidity” between business and personal accounts: “Business owner liquid wealth is difficult to characterize, even among businesses with single owners. They may hold cash in both their personal and business deposit accounts, and transfer funds easily between the two in ways that may or may not relate to the operational performance of their business.” The private sector maintains consistent efforts to address these small business lending challenges. For two decades, for example, banks have made greater use of new credit scoring technology. Many lenders have also increasingly tested methods such as cash-flow underwriting. The purpose of a loan guarantee—the most common form of government support for small business lending—is to establish “a mechanism for pricing loans that is independent of borrower behavior” and reduce expected risk for lenders. By doing so, credit access for small businesses, especially those who cannot access it elsewhere, should expand. Who Applies for and Receives SBA-Guaranteed Loans? Between 2014 and 2019, among those small employer firms applying for credit, about one-quarter, on average, reported in the Small Business&hellip;",

    "content": "On January 19, the Biden administration released their long-anticipated Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to rewrite and strengthen regulations implementing the Fair Housing Act’s mandate to “affirmatively further fair housing,” which require HUD and recipients of HUD funding to take additional steps towards ensuring fair housing beyond simply pledging not to discriminate. The rule—the most recent in a series of regulatory revisions and amendments over the years—aims to respond to previous feedback and criticism about AFFH implementation while giving the administration a tool to more forcefully advance its directive to redress discriminatory housing practices and policies. To that end, the proposed rule makes the following key changes: Streamlines grantees’ fair housing analysis obligations Prioritizes the setting of realistic and meaningful fair housing goals Provides flexibility for participants to design and execute their Equity Plans Increases public transparency into HUD’s review process Strengthens mechanisms for accountability, evaluation, and enforcement Background The proposed AFFH Rule is similar to HUD’s 2015 AFFH Rule, which was promulgated under the Obama administration and repealed in 2020 by the Trump administration, citing its onerous burden on localities and federal overreach into local housing policy. The proposed AFFH rule’s core planning process requires program participants to identify barriers to fair housing in their communities based on data analysis and community engagement. It also set goals to remedy them in the form of Equity Plans (a modified version of the Assessments of Fair Housing defined by the 2015 Rule), submit the plans to HUD for review, and implement the Equity Plans. In response to communities who found the previous AFFH rule difficult to implement due to concerns around administrative capacity, demographic relevance, and the scope of data analysis, HUD has streamlined AFFH program requirements to ensure that all work required of grantees is directly tied to a meaningful fair housing outcome. Summary of Key Changes 1. Streamlines grantees’ fair housing analysis obligations. HUD has proposed replacing the lengthy planning assessment with a shorter, less data analysis-driven questionnaire. The 2015 Rule included an Assessment Tool that provided HUD grantees with a large amount of data and a list of contributing factors and required them to respond to approximately 100 questions using data-driven analysis, which was difficult for HUD grantees with less relevant expertise and capacity to complete. The proposed rule eliminates the Assessment Tool and the contributing factors analysis, instead requiring participants to respond to questions in a few broad areas (seven for “consolidated plan” recipients and five for public housing agencies) and allowing them to determine their preferred format for the responses, with data analysis no longer required for each question. The proposed rule also scales the expected complexity of answers based on the size of a HUD grantee. For example, smaller public housing agencies (PHAs) who are more likely to operate in rural areas or other localities with fewer community assets, more limited public infrastructure, more homogenous demographic patterns, and smaller populations may provide briefer answers so long as their responses are still grounded in the HUD-provided data&hellip;",

    "content": "This week, the House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing, Combatting the Economic Threat from China. Exploring the “risks to U.S. interests posed by China&#8217;s economic and geopolitical actions,&#8221; the committee will seek insight on investment screening and international financial flows, among other things. Concern over China and its impact on American economic competitiveness has become an area of shared bipartisan interest over the last few years. Early in the 118th Congress, members of the House of Representatives voted in overwhelming bipartisan fashion to establish a Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. To inform the Financial Services Committee’s examination of the “economic threat from China,” BPC has outlined the following questions which merit their consideration. Closely examine the competitiveness implications of digital currency. Meltdowns and fraud among cryptocurrency companies over the last several months have raised doubts among U.S. lawmakers about the economic promise of cryptocurrency and, more broadly, digital assets. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has, however, continued to move forward with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that is, in part, a potential threat to the U.S. dollar’s status as global reserve currency. American policymakers must explore the implications of this and what an appropriate regulatory architecture might be for digital currency. In addition to restrictions on the use of China’s CBDC, what steps do the Federal Reserve, other federal agencies, and private institutions need to explore in pursuit of that regulatory architecture? Commit to and ensure a significant role for the private sector in financing economic activity. In its hearing memo, the Financial Services Committee charged the CCP with &#8220;state-led, mercantilist economic policies” that undermine U.S. companies and economic interests. In turn, the committee asserted, the United States must “recommit to free markets&#8221; and &#8220;maintaining an open, vibrant, and resilient economic system.&#8221; Over the last few years, Congress has authorized, often with bipartisan approval, hundreds of billions of dollars for what many call a “new industrial policy.” There is potential tension between such industrial policy and this committee’s rejection of “mercantilist” policy. In what ways can financial institutions of all types be involved in devising new funding models for Congress’ ambitions without crossing the line between mercantilism and an “open, vibrant” market economy? Carefully balance private investment decisions with national security interests. The U.S. government screens foreign investments in American companies; scrutiny has grown more intense in recent years. Many policymakers, in Congress and the administration, have called for the same process to be applied to investments by American companies in countries such as China. The business community has been split on this issue, and the calls for scrutiny of outbound investment appear to run counter to this committee&#8217;s dedication to free markets. Yet it seems clear that some measure of concern is warranted. How can the U.S. government and American financial companies best balance national security concerns with the continuing need for reliance on global investment for our economy to thrive?

    "content": "As congressional leaders set their 2023 policy agenda, one issue garnering strong interest from both Democrats and Republicans is high prescription drug prices—and particularly the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Following last year’s passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which, over the objections of pharmaceutical manufacturers, gave Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices and cap insulin copayments, PBMs may be Congress’ next target. Both Congress and the administration increasingly scrutinize PBMs over concerns about the lack of transparency around their negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. PBMs assert they produce savings for employers and consumers, but pharmaceutical representatives argue PBMs pocket those savings. In July 2022, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into the nation’s largest PBMs and the role of consolidation on rising prescription prices; The FTC required them to submit data regarding their business practices. Oversight efforts have bipartisan support—a key factor in moving legislation in a split Congress. News reports of “spread pricing,” where PBMs charge health plans and employers a higher price than what they paid pharmacies for the drug, and market consolidation have further increased attention on PBMs. While PBMs often get blamed for rising drug prices, are they really the right target? Let’s explore the current evidence of PBM impact on drug prices and how transparency policies could help rein in prices. The role of PBMs PBMs contract with health plans to administer pharmacy benefits and often develop prescription drug formularies by acting as intermediaries between health plans and pharmaceutical manufacturers. For certain prescriptions, some PBMs receive rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical companies in exchange for formulary placement. Multiple studies, including from the Congressional Budget Office, found that rebate payments lower governmental costs and copays for plan enrollees. However, other evidence suggests these practices can raise prices for consumers. Regardless, the traditional PBM business model creates perverse incentives for keeping prices down: While PBMs negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers, their revenue is based on a percentage of the drug’s list price—potentially incentivizing them to prioritize higher cost drugs. Additionally, a high level of PBM consolidation has given a handful of companies major market power: six PBMs now control 95% of the private market. In recent years, PBMs have also merged with health insurers, giving them even more influence over medications that patients can access. PBMs argue that this market share gives them leverage to negotiate effectively with pharmaceutical companies, to the benefit of employers and consumers. Mixed evidence PBMs assert they produce savings for employers and consumers, but there is evidence that PBMs may be passing too little of that savings on to customers. The Ohio Department of Medicaid found that CVS Caremark and Optum Rx pocketed the 8.8% difference between what they billed managed care plans and what they paid pharmacies. A Delaware state auditor report also found that the PBM Express Scripts overcharged the state employee prescription drug plan $24.5 million. Other entities assert that PBMs saved them pharmaceutical dollars. For example, the School Employees Retirement System of Ohio’s (SERS)&hellip;",

    "content": "After a nearly seven-year drought, the House this week considered a bill under an open rule, allowing any member to offer an amendment on the floor. BPC’s Healthy Congress Index has charted the decline of open deliberation in the House and Senate since its launch in 2015. One of the most concerning trends we noted then was that opportunities for members to offer amendments had become nearly non-existent. The situation only worsened, and the House would see it’s last open amendment process about a year later on May 26, 2016. In a welcome development, H.R. 21, a bill to limit the drawdown of petroleum in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, came to the House floor this week under a modified open rule. Should the proponents of regular order declare victory? In short, not yet. In 2014, BPC’s Commission on Political Reform recommended that, “The majority leadership in the House of Representatives should allow the Rules Committee to report more modified open rules,” warning of the increasingly restrictive amendment process. Such a return to a more open amendment process will improve deliberation and debate, engage more members in the legislative process, and foster bipartisan consensus building. The amendment process in the House is typically governed by predetermined rules specific to each bill: open rules allow all members to offer amendments on the floor; closed rules allow none; structured rules allow only those specified by the Rules Committee. A form of open rule, a modified open rule, allows any member to offer an amendment, but requires the pre-printing of amendments in the Congressional Record, sets an overall time cap on the amendment process, or both. In recent history, the Rules Committee, and thus House floor debate, has been controlled by the Speaker, with his or her party making up a supermajority of the committee’s members. Whether the consideration of H.R. 21 under an open rule is cause for celebration is another question. It is important to consider why and how H.R. 21 came to the floor in this manner. The modified open rule for the bill was not the result of Rules Committee action, as most bills would be. It was provided for in the resolution adopting the overall rules of the House for the 118th Congress, which were adopted on January 9th, 2023. That resolution, H.Res. 5, was the product of negotiations related to the Speaker election, making it difficult to assess whether this represents the beginning of a longer term shift in House leadership’s approach to the amendment process or a shorter term compromise to bring the Speaker election to a close. Pledges to open up the legislative process and return to “regular order” have become common for those seeking the speakership. Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) made these promises central to his bid for the job. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) likewise planned to restore a more open amendment process, though, it was to limited success. When Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) returned to the job in 2019, she highlighted her intent to&hellip;",

    "content": "In its proposed rulemaking on November 7, 2022, SBA put forth three significant changes: lifting the Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) license moratorium, creating a new type of SBLC called a Mission-Based SBLC, and removing the loan authorization requirement. The lifting of the SBLC moratorium, which some Republicans and Democrats called for in legislation introduced last Congress, represents both a significant departure from the past and an uncertain future impact. What Might Change? SBLC License Moratorium While banks and credit unions are the primary providers of 7(a) loans, the Small Business Act permits SBA to authorize other entities to also make government-guaranteed loans. SBA has thus classified certain non-depository lending institutions as SBLCs. In 1982, SBA established a moratorium on licensing new SBLCs because it did not have sufficient resources to exercise regulatory oversight of additional license holders. Since then, the number of SBLCs has been limited to 14, though these licenses have been transferred from time to time from one institution to another, with SBA approval. The proposed rule would: Lift the moratorium on issuing new SBLC licenses. SBA would be able to increase the number of regular SBLCs and add a new type of SBLC, called a Mission-Based SBLC (see below). SBA expects to license three new SBLCs under this change and that each would make eight 7(a) loans in their first year. That, according to the SBA, could potentially increase to 425 loans per year over four years. Mission-Based SBLC To close financing gaps for underserved small businesses, SBA proposes to create a new type of SBLC. The change would: Create a new Mission-Based SBLC designation for nonprofit organizations with a mission to fill an identified capital market gap, which may include geographic area, startup businesses, business sector, and demographics. Allow Community Advantage lenders to become Mission-Based SBLCs, with permanent participation in 7(a). Set unique minimum requirements for each Mission-Based SBLC, based on that entity’s target market, risk tolerance, financing needs, and other factors. SBA states that it will approve Mission-Based SBLCs according to market conditions and its oversight capacity. Loan Authorization Currently, both the 7(a) and 504 programs require lenders to sign and submit a loan authorization document to SBA. The proposed rule would: Remove the loan authorization requirement and rely on the terms and conditions of the loan application that lenders also submit. In proposing this change, SBA states that the current process duplicates efforts and creates opportunities for a “mismatch of information” between the authorization and the loan application that contains terms and conditions. What They’re Saying SBLC Moratorium &amp; Mission-Based SBLC A significant point of contention pertains to regulatory oversight of different lenders. Unlike the majority of 7(a) lenders, which are overseen by federal banking regulators (e.g., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration, among others), “SBLC’s are regulated, supervised, and examined solely by SBA.” This is somewhat similar to Community Advantage lenders, which are state regulated.

SBA also hopes they will attract more lenders into the program. What Might Change? Lending Criteria | Government-guaranteed loans to small businesses are not intended to be “bad” or unwise. Lenders in the 7(a) and 504 programs have historically been required to consider specific factors in determining creditworthiness. SBA’s proposed streamlining changes would: Align lenders’ 7(a) and 504 decisions with credit analysis processes used for their similarly sized non-SBA loans. Allow lenders to use data and modeling techniques, or business credit scoring models such as the Small Business Scoring Service. Reduce the number of factors for lenders to consider when determining creditworthiness. Required factors will be credit score or history, earnings or cashflow, and equity or collateral (if applicable). These changes would, according to SBA, draw on the agency’s pandemic experience, when technology platforms were leveraged in new ways to facilitate loans. They would also acknowledge lenders’ increasing use of new technological tools in assessing creditworthiness. Affiliation Requirements SBA considers several factors to determine eligibility for its financial assistance programs. The proposed rule removes the “principal of control” from the list of factors used in determining affiliation. Partial Changes of Ownership Currently, 7(a) loans may be used to finance a complete change of business ownership. The proposed rule would expand the allowable uses of loan proceeds to include partial changes of ownership—something SBA says will help small businesses owned by retiring owners remain open and help more employees own a share of the business where they work. Between FY2018 and FY2021, only 17 of 31,940 7(a) loan guarantees used to affect a change of business ownership involved Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), a common form of employee ownership. The proposed changes are part of a larger bipartisan effort, including passage of the Main Street Employee Ownership Act in the FY19 NDAA, to make it easier for small businesses to use 7(a) loans to transition to employee ownership. What They’re Saying In its proposed rule, SBA states that it anticipates little to no additional cost to the loan subsidy because of its proposed changes. Nevertheless, many current 7(a) lenders expressed concern during the public comment period that loosening lending criteria could have detrimental effects on lending, due in part to differences in the quality of scoring models lenders use. These commenters said that allowing lenders to use their own models, which include and weigh data differently, could increase the number of SBA-backed loans that default. Other commenters urged SBA to expand the proposed rule by eliminating the personal guarantee requirement for 7(a) loans. Doing so, they argued, would allow cooperatives and other multi-stakeholder businesses to access government-backed loans.",

    "content": "At the beginning of August 2022, SBA’s “Regulatory Reform Initiative” rule, originally proposed in December 2020, took effect. The rule was intended to revise or remove regulations pertaining to SBA lending programs that were deemed “obsolete, unnecessary, ineffective, or burdensome.” What Changed? The most significant change was to raise allowable variable interest rates, according to loan size rather than loan maturity, in the 7(a) program. For loans under $50,000 the maximum rate is base rate plus 6.5 points (with the prime rate an allowable base rate). For loans between $50,000 and $250,000, the maximum is base plus six points. For loans between $250,000 and $350,000, it is base plus 4.5 points. For loans over $350,000, the maximum is base plus three points. At today’s prime rate, a 7(a)-backed loan for $25,000 could have an interest rate of up to 14%. The new maximum variable rates apply to all types of 7(a) loans; previously, rates varied between different 7(a) programs. This standardization is part of SBA’s streamlining to reduce the administrative burden on lenders. What They’re Saying Small business lenders have for many years pointed to interest rate caps in the 7(a) program as a barrier to making more small-dollar loans. While the costs to a lender of processing and underwriting are the same for a $25,000 loan as for a $250,000 loan, inability to charge a higher rate on the smaller loan meant that the incentive for lenders was to make the larger loan. In its justification for the higher allowable rates, SBA nodded to this reality: “historically, smaller loans are riskier and have a higher default rate and, therefore, a higher maximum interest rate is warranted. … By basing the rates on loan amounts and allowing Lenders to charge higher rates for smaller loans, Lenders would have more incentive to make smaller loans.” One consequence, not addressed in the proposed or final rule, is that this erases the differential that previously existed between 7(a) and Community Advantage.",

    "content": "At the end of May 2022, changes to the Community Advantage program took effect. These changes followed a notice the agency had issued in April. That notice, among other things, extended the program through September 2024 and lifted the moratorium, in place since 2018, on letting new mission lenders into the program. What Changed? The effective rule:  Allowed Community Advantage lenders to use the same credit criteria and collateral policies as they do with non-SBA loans. Removed restrictions on ineligibility relating to criminal records. Small businesses with “associates” who were incarcerated, on probation or parole, or have been indicted for a felony or a crime are now eligible for government-guaranteed loans, although lenders will evaluate loan applications from these borrowers according to their risk-based lending criteria. Increased the maximum loan size to $350,000 from $250,000. Authorized, for the first time, Community Advantage lenders to make revolving lines of credit. Doing so will still be subject to SBA review and approval. Raised the threshold for unsecured loans to $50,000, from $25,000. Modified the fee structure “to offset costs that may prevent lenders from making more loans, especially small loans under $50,000.” Previously, there was a cap of $2,500 on the fees that lenders could charge borrowers. The new graduated fee structure permits a fee of up to $8,750 on a $350,000 loan. For loans under $50,000, the maximum fee is $1,750. Updated allowable interest rates according to loan size. At today’s prime rate of 7.5%, the maximum interest rate on a Community Advantage loan under $50,000 would be 14%. Increased flexibility pertaining to hazard insurance, which SBA had previously required on all collateral, irrespective of loan size. SBA “determined that the hazard insurance requirement is particularly burdensome and costly for businesses seeking small dollar loans.” Now, lenders may follow the hazard insurance policies they have in place for similarly sized, non-SBA loans. Simplified affiliation rules, based on the “successful experience of affiliation streamlining under the temporary pandemic relief programs.” What They’re Saying Based on conversations BPC has held with lenders and stakeholders as well as comments submitted to SBA before the changes were finalized, these Community Advantage modifications were welcome. Lenders said they would ease credit underwriting and processing; the new affiliation rules are simpler and easier to understand, some said. Flexibility regarding hazard insurance would also be beneficial, better reflecting real-world circumstances: “So many times, there is little if any real practical liquidation collateral value in the small business personal property,” one Community Advantage lender told us.",

    "content": "With more than $1 trillion in federal funding flowing to infrastructure projects as a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the federal government must take steps to ensure those funds bring taxpayers the best possible value. BPC’s research has demonstrated that lack of capacity at state and local agencies can be a major barrier to delivering cost-effective projects, particularly in smaller communities and rural areas. Decisions made early in a project’s lifecycle—like scope, budget, and delivery method—have a direct influence on the ultimate success of the project, but these can be some of the most challenging issues for agency staff to resolve. BPC recommended ramping up technical assistance to recipients of federal funding as part of BIL implementation. Fortunately, the federal agencies responsible for the BIL are heeding that call. The Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration offer interesting examples of how federal agencies are taking technical assistance to the next level to help their stakeholders make effective use of the law’s funding. Department of Transportation USDOT has a long history of providing technical assistance to its grantees. The Federal Highway Administration has an office in every state, staffed with experts that work closely with state and local agencies. USDOT’s website features numerous toolkits and resources to help planners, project developers, engineers, public officials, and advocates understand issues ranging from public-private partnerships to roadway safety countermeasures. USDOT is also the home of the Build America Bureau, a one-stop shop for questions related to transportation project finance, permitting, and delivery. On top of this extensive base, USDOT has recently taken several innovative actions to improve its technical assistance offerings. In April 2022, Sec. Buttigieg announced that he was creating a first-of-its kind position within the Secretary’s office: a Strategic Advisor for Technical Assistance and Community Solutions, responsible for developing and overseeing the department’s capacity building efforts. With a high-level official elevating the profile of technical assistance within the agency, capacity building programs are being rolled out nearly as quickly as grant programs. Soon, USDOT is expected to launch two technical assistance programs authorized by the BIL: the Asset Concession and Innovative Finance Program, which will provide grants to states, localities, and tribal governments to help them identify, analyze, and plan potential P3 projects, and the Rural and Tribal Assistance Pilot Program, which will provide support to rural communities for project planning and development. By enhancing the expertise at state and local agencies, these programs have the potential to significantly improve the ability of public sector agencies to partner more effectively with the private sector, delivering projects more quickly and cost-effectively. In another promising step, USDOT launched two joint initiatives with other agencies to address cross-cutting issues. The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, a partnership between USDOT and the Department of Energy, has already assisted states in meeting the deadline for submitting state EV infrastructure plans under the National Elective Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI).

The bill, which President Biden signed, is aimed squarely at enabling the United States to, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) put it, “outcompete China.” Concerns over U.S. competitiveness relative to China have driven widespread angst in Washington. House Republicans, who will have a majority in the 118th Congress, plan to form a Select Committee focused on the “new Cold War” with China. The CHIPS and Science Act marked a significant step in lawmakers’ efforts to enhance U.S. competitiveness. It focused in particular on boosting R&amp;D spending and strengthening the domestic presence of semiconductor manufacturing, a critically important area. Just after CHIPS and Science was adopted, BPC’s Jonathan Arias sat down with two distinguished Americans, both of whom have a long history of working on issues related to national competitiveness. Ralph Gomory is the former head of IBM Research and served as president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for 18 years. Patrick Mulloy is, among other things, a former commissioner of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.

    "content": "Spectrum allocation is a complex issue that plays a vital role in internet access. With the recent eruption of low-Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite businesses, more players than ever are vying for a slice of the radio spectrum pie. But the bodies responsible for coordinating the use of these frequencies have many challenges ahead, including increased demand for an already over saturated good, coordination across multiple countries and regions, and testing the quality and capabilities of LEO satellites to transmit data. This blog will explore these challenges and opportunities of spectrum allocation for LEO satellites and how it shapes the future of broadband services. LEO Overview Orbiting between 160 to 2,000 kilometers, or nearly 100 to 1,200 miles above Earth’s surface, LEO satellites have many benefits over traditional geostationary (GEO) satellites that orbit at altitudes closer to 36,000 kilometers. Their proximity to Earth ensures minimal lag time or low latency for fast communication or data transfers. This closeness may help LEO satellites avoid certain disruptions, such as solar flares or other atmospheric events that could degrade signals and disrupt communication. LEO satellites move quickly around the planet, unlike GEO satellites which are stationary. Their orbits enable global coverage but also have further implications for international cooperation. One of the main advantages of using LEO satellites for communications is that they provide broadband coverage to remote or hard-to-reach areas. Their global coverage makes them well-suited for providing rural areas, which often lack access to high-speed traditional broadband networks. LEO satellites can also supplement coverage if natural disasters or damages, such as earthquakes or storms, disrupt terrestrial infrastructure. While wildfires swept across the Upper Northwest United States, LEO satellites provided vital connectivity to first responders and residents in need. Benefits and Challenges The technology has overcome many obstacles to achieve reliable use and is continuing to improve on optimizing its capabilities. Data throughput, or capacity to transfer data, has significantly improved partly due to signals becoming more direct and powerful, as well as inter-satellite links (ISLs) that enhance the capacity of a satellite and its transmission rate. In addition, large constellations made up of thousands of small satellites will be able to deliver much faster speeds once fully deployed, up to 1 Gbps, helping to deliver more reliable internet for more users on the ground. The use of LEO satellites for broadband communications also raises some challenges, particularly when it comes to spectrum allocation. Increasing demand for radio spectrum accompanies a rising number of wireless broadband and telecommunication technologies. The radio spectrum is the range of electromagnetic frequencies used for wireless communication and is a limited resource. As more satellites are launched into low Earth orbit, they are competing with not only other satellites but may also compete with fixed wireless services. The increasing demand for the remaining available spectrum can lead to interference and other problems. The FCC has proposed measures to ensure fair spectrum allocation, making Ku-, Ka-, and V-bands (frequencies ranges in the high- to mid-bands) available for sharing between&hellip;",

These disasters are not distributed evenly—certain regions are particularly vulnerable to climate hazards in the coming years. As a continuation of BPC’s recent state-by-state analysis of America’s housing stock, this blog highlights which states have the most housing units at risk of floods and wildfires. The data show that both red and blue states face severe climate threats that will require adapting existing housing stock, as well as strategic planning to minimize any risks to new development. As the graph above shows, about 6.9 million homes are located in zip codes with a major risk of wildfires, meaning they have at least a 7% chance of burning over the next 30 years. Based on a comprehensive risk model by the First Street Foundation, incorporating both the likelihood and potential depth of flooding, 3.7 million homes are located in zip codes with a major flood risk. This does not necessarily indicate that wildfires are a greater threat overall—in fact, flooding has been both more costly and deadly over the past couple of decades. See the top five states with the most homes at risk of floods and wildfires below, both as a percentage of the state’s overall housing stock and in absolute terms.

    "content": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on the ability of a computer to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This technology has the potential to greatly impact how we work in several ways. NLP can be used to automate tasks that process large amounts of text, such as sorting and organizing emails, transcribing audio and video recordings, and analyzing customer feedback. This can save time and increase efficiency for businesses and individuals alike, allowing users to focus on more complex and creative tasks. NLP can also be used to improve communication and collaboration by enabling machines to understand and respond to human language more naturally and intuitively. This can make it easier for people to work together, regardless of location or language, and can facilitate the development of new and innovative technologies. Overall, the use of NLP will continue to evolve and impact how we work in the future. Very recently, Open AI launched a new AI-assisted chatbot called ChatGPT. This program provides free and accessible usage to Open AI’s GPT-3 natural language model. GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3) is a large language model launched in 2021. It is one of the most advanced language models in the world and can generate human-like text based on a given prompt. GPT-3 has been trained on a vast amount of text data and can generate text in a variety of styles, including news articles, poems, and conversation. It has been used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, text summarization, and conversational AI. GPT-3 is a powerful tool for processing and generating text and has helped to advance the field of natural language processing. Its capacity is beyond comparison. For example, given the prompt of “Write a sonnet about bipartisanship,” this is what it produced: NLP has a long and complex history with roots in various disciplines, including linguistics, computer science, and psychology. The first major developments in NLP date back to the 1950s, with the advent of computers and the need to make them more effective at processing and understanding human language. Early NLP systems focused on simple tasks such as machine translation and language generation, but the field has grown more sophisticated over time. In the 1980s and 1990s, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence led to more complex NLP systems that could handle a wider range of tasks, including speech recognition and text analysis. Today, NLP is used in various applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to machine translation and sentiment analysis. With advancements in AI, NLP has undergone significant developments over the last few years, leading to the use of machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and performance of NLP systems, the development of neural networks for language processing, and the integration of NLP with other AI technologies, such as speech recognition and image analysis. The NLP technology this is based on has the potential to greatly impact how we work. As technology continues to advance and become&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress is one step closer to improving Americans’ financial security by including a host of provisions collectively known as “SECURE 2.0” in the bipartisan year-end spending deal that is expected to become law this week. The legislation builds on the 2019 Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act and includes many recommendations of BPC’s Commission on Retirement Security and Personal Savings. From small technical corrections to significant policy changes, SECURE 2.0 would expand participation and boost savings in workplace plans, extend support to small businesses trying to help their workers prepare for retirement, and ease access to lifetime income products. The package would also increase some tax incentives for the already economically secure. Enhancing Savings Tools &amp; Boosting Participation A 2022 BPC-Morning Consult poll found that only 52% of individuals with household income at or below $50,000 have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, compared to 79% of people with higher household income. Employees want help saving—not only for retirement, but also to buffer against emergencies. SECURE 2.0 includes a variety of provisions to introduce new tools, expand coverage, increase portability, and enhance incentives for workers to save and for employers and plan sponsors to automate healthy saving behavior. Expanding Automatic Enrollment Starting in 2025, requires new 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans to automatically enroll eligible employees (with the option for the employee to opt out) at between 3% and 10% of wages, and automatically increase that amount by 1 percentage point per year until it reaches at least 10% (and not more than 15%). Exempts businesses with 10 or fewer employees, businesses that have been open for less than three years, and church and government plans. Prioritizing Emergency Savings Allows defined-contribution (DC) plan sponsors to automatically enroll non-highly compensated workers into “pension-linked emergency savings accounts” (PLESAs) at up to 3% of post-tax pay alongside retirement account contributions. (Employees retain the ability to opt out or change their contribution.) Savers can withdraw funds from the PLESA tax- and penalty-free at any time. Automatic deductions continue up to an account balance of $2,500 (or a lower ceiling set by the plan), after which automatic contributions are either paused or invested in an individual’s Roth (after-tax) retirement account. Employee contributions to PLESAs are treated as retirement contributions for purposes of employer matches. Starting in 2024, permits DC plan sponsors to allow participants to withdraw up to $1,000 penalty-free per calendar year for emergency personal expenses. The individual must replenish the withdrawn amount before a subsequent emergency distribution is allowed during any of the following three years. Reducing Leakage by Increasing Portability Allows service providers to facilitate automatic transfers from a participant’s old workplace retirement plan into their new plan upon job change to help consolidate small account balances and reduce leakage from the system. Employees always retain ability to opt out of such transfers. Starting in 2024, allows employers to automatically transfer account balances of former employees up to $7,000 (up from the current $5,000 limitation) into a default IRA unless the participant&hellip;",

Campus Happenings Ann Coulter ’84 Speaking Event at Cornell a Non-Starter After Disruptions, Protest Prompt an Early Exit Lucas Santiago | The Cornell Daily Sun | November 13, 2022 A Cornell student group, Network of Enlightened Women, invited alumna Ann Coulter to analyze the midterm elections. Cornell administrators refused calls to cancel the event and assisted Coulter’s security. Nevertheless, “The event followed a domino-like pattern. Protesters were slowly ushered out by police and security, Coulter would attempt to speak again, and then would be cut-off by a different student somewhere else in the hall.” The event ended after 20 minutes. Valdosta Prof’s ‘Woke’ Lesson Draws Parent Fire, Free Speech Support Vanessa McCray | The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | November 14, 2022 After the parent of a Valdosta State University undergraduate complained to the dean that a tenured biology professor taught “woke” lessons in her Evolution and the Diversity of Life course, the dean warned her “to change her approach or else she would be moved to another class.” The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and Pen America asserted that the public university violated the professor’s academic freedom to assign content germane to the subject. At press time, she was scheduled to teach the course in Spring 2023. BYU-I Instructors Fired for Failing ‘Ecclesiastical Clearance.’ They Can’t Find Out Why. Tamarra Kemsley | The Salt Lake Tribune | November 28, 2022 Brigham Young University-Idaho dismissed two adjunct faculty members after they “failed to obtain ‘ecclesiastical clearance.’” Both “said they had met the requirements as they’d been explained to them,” and both also reported having raised question about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ teaching on LGBTQ individuals; they suspect that these questions caused their dismissals. KS Supreme Court Justice Stegall Leaves KU, Cites Uproar Over Conservative Campus Speaker Jonathan Shorman and Katie Bernard | The Kansas City Star | November 30, 2022 A Kansas Supreme Court judge notified the dean of the University of Kansas School of Law that he will no longer teach at the school because, in his view, the school “fosters a spirit of fear” about expressing unpopular views. The judge’s resignation came after the school’s Federalist Society chapter was pressured to withdraw an invitation to a speaker; the event went ahead, with protests. ‘Lock Him Up’: Protesters Gather to Oppose George Bush Speech Seth Nelson | The Exponent | December 6, 2022 Several dozen protestors from the Young Democratic Socialists of America and the Greater Lafayette Democratic Socialists of America protested a Purdue University address by former President George W.

    "content": "Rate increases have accelerated in recent years, in part, to compensate for the chronic, historic underpricing of water services and pay for rising costs associated with aging and deteriorating infrastructure, deferred maintenance, growing (or shrinking) customer bases, regulatory compliance burdens, and increased system risks, e.g., from climate change to cybersecurity risks. In fact, the costs of water and sewer services rose nationally by 46% in the last decade, outpacing inflation by almost 20 percentage points. The combined water and wastewater bill for a typical American household has now passed $111 per month. A primary challenge for water and wastewater systems, even pre-pandemic, is how to price water services to fully cover costs and maintain affordability for customers who already struggle to pay their bills. In 12 major U.S. cities, more than 1.5 million households combined owed $1.1 billion in past-due water bills in 2020. When water bills become unmanageable, missed payments and delinquent accounts can lead to service disconnection or system shutoffs, an outcome with many negative impacts for customers and a utility. Disconnection, which can legally make a home uninhabitable in some jurisdictions, can have the same effect as eviction and even lead to children being placed in protective care. As such, many utilities—when they have the requisite technical, managerial, and financial capacity—have revisited their rate structures with a focus on equity and affordability concerns and have implemented strategies to help low-income customers better manage their bills through customer assistance programs or CAPs. Concerned about the pandemic’s impact on the ability of low-income households to pay for water services, the potential of increased service shut-offs, and the public health imperative to maintain water services amid a pandemic, members of both parties in Congress proposed providing aid to low-income families to help pay water bills—a concept that had been introduced in legislation previously but never advanced. Congress ultimately appropriated $638 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (P.L. 116-260) in December 2020 and an additional $500 million in the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2) in March 2021, though the latter was passed without any Republican support. Congress authorized HHS to create the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program as a temporary program with its authorization set to expire December 31, 2023. A New Federal Water Assistance Program LIHWAP is the first federal program to exclusively assist low-income families with their water and wastewater bills. Some federal housing programs, like the Housing Choice Voucher program, do account for utility costs, like water service, when calculating and providing rental subsidies but they are not specifically targeted to help with these costs. LIHWAP is modeled after HHS’s Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which has been providing states, tribes, and territories with federal funding for needs-based heating and cooling bill assistance since its creation in 1981. Like LIHEAP, LIHWAP is intended to provide one-time funding to help low-income households afford their utility bills and maintain service. LIHWAP funding can be used to assist with: Paying arrears Reconnecting services&hellip;",

    "content": "The United States faces an acute shortage of homes both for rent and sale, resulting in increasingly unaffordable housing costs for families across the nation. The current undersupply is largely a result of the failure to build enough new homes over the past couple of decades. To provide more insight into our nation’s housing supply, BPC produced a housing supply data dashboard, using permitting and other housing data collected and analyzed by Rosen Consulting Group. This analysis provides key takeaways on national trends in housing permits and includes a state-by-state breakdown of permitting data for all 50 states. See our state-by-state housing supply dashboard here. Over the last 20 years, the annual number of new homes permitted in the United States has declined compared to previous decades, even as the population has increased by tens of millions of people. From 2000-2021, the U.S. had an annual average of 1,338,019 homes permitted, compared to 1,374,752 from 1960-1999—a decrease of 36,733 homes permitted annually or 2.6%.1 All of the decrease came from multi-unit housing—with a particularly steep decline in permits for 2-4 unit buildings, often referred to as the “missing middle”—while single-family housing permits increased. As the graph below shows, new housing construction slowed substantially in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis, as demand for homeownership plummeted. However, the population continued to grow, with an increase of 2.2 people for every new home—exacerbating the structural gap between the nation’s housing needs and its housing supply. When consumers emerged from the recession, developers were years behind in building up supply to meet the resurgence of demand—a pattern that risks repeating itself in the future as housing starts have slowed in recent months in response to high mortgage rates. While the nation’s housing supply has not kept up with population growth or household formation, housing supply varies across the nation.

Rachel Snyderman is the Senior Associate Director of Economic Policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The American Rescue Plan’s (ARP) temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in 2021 shined a spotlight on the program’s ability to reduce child poverty. While lawmakers deliberate the credit’s future, momentum is building to make near-term modifications in a coming year-end budget deal or early in the new Congress—well before pre-ARP modifications to the CTC, passed in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Such conversations raise the possibility that both parties can prioritize permanent fixes to ensure the program maintains its place as a critical part of the American social safety net. This investment in American families, however, will only achieve its full potential when it reaches every eligible household. Fortunately, we have learned a tremendous amount in the last year and a half about how to increase take-up of the CTC. But while the IRS has made great strides to advance this work, they have largely done so without explicit congressional authorization, making it hard to prioritize and institutionalize. The Inflation Reduction Act’s $80 billion investment in the agency to improve taxpayer services is a laudable start. If Congress strikes a deal to expand the CTC during the lame duck session, the IRS should direct these new resources towards pursuing key access and administrative measures to ensure the policy reaches its intended beneficiaries. Among these include: Simplifying the filing process for low-income households Congress should direct the IRS to authorize a simplified filing process for many low-income families to claim the CTC—and its companion, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—without providing tax documents like W-2s or reporting their own earnings, which the agency already has on file. In each of the last three filing seasons, the IRS authorized simplified filing to claim Economic Impact Payments and the 2021 CTC, and the results showed it was transformational. Hundreds of thousands of families—many of whom had never interacted with the tax system at all before—were able to file simplified returns and claim their credits, often in less than 15 minutes, providing only their basic household and payment information. With congressional support, the IRS could expand simplified filing permanently for the CTC and EITC, allowing households with only W-2 income to elect to have their credits calculated for them based on IRS’s own copies of W-2 data. In the short term, such refunds may be delayed while IRS cleans and processes W-2 data, but pending improvements in IRS business systems would eventually allow the process to happen in real time. It is important to note, however, that absent this expansion of the simplified filing process, the current-law version of the CTC could not be covered by it.

    "content": "While still much smaller in number than encounters at the southern border, the increases in encounters at the northern border and at sea indicate that migrants are seeking alternative routes to enter the U.S. These routes, though sometimes less tightly controlled than the southern border, are equally as perilous, with the number of fatal drownings in the Caribbean rising and those attempting to cross the northern border being exposed to extreme, and sometimes fatal, weather conditions. As the Biden administration attempts to grapple with the end of Title 42 and its impact on migration at the southern border, it must also address these alternative routes. Migrant Encounters at the Northern Border The northern land border saw a significant increase in encounters this fiscal year. In fiscal year 2021, just over 27,000 migrants were encountered at the northern border by the Office of Field Operations (CBP officers at lawful ports of entry) and U.S. Border Patrol (agents patrolling the rest of the border), slightly below the FY2020 total of about 32,500. However, in FY2022, there were close to 110,000 encounters—an increase of nearly 350%, seen below in Figure 1. Figure 1: Northern Land Border Encounters (FY2020-FY2023TD) Though much of the increase in encounters at the norther land border this fiscal year was driven by encounters with Canadians—40,600 Canadians encountered in FY2022, compared to 16,200 Canadians in FY2021—there were significant increases in encounters with Chinese, Indian, Ukrainian migrants, and migrants from other countries. India and China are Canada’s two largest source countries for new immigrants. As economic and political turmoil has increased in India and China countries, it’s possible a larger number of migrants from both countries are making the journey to Canada and then continuing onwards to the United States. There were nearly 6,700 encounters of Chinese migrants at the northern border in FY2022, compared to just about 900 encounters in FY2021, and more than 17,300 encounters of Indian migrants in FY2022, rising from just about 2,200 in FY2021, seen below in Figure 2. Figure 2: Encounters by Nationality, China and India (FY2021-FY2022) There has also been an increase in encounters of both nationalities at the southern border—the number of Indians encountered at the southwestern border rose to nearly 64,000 in FY2022, compared to around 30,700 in FY2021. The number of Chinese encounters at the southern border rose from 450 in FY2021 to close to 2,200 in FY2022. Drivers of Migration Experts have put forward a number of reasons for the possible increase in Indian migrants to the southern border, pointing toward a climate of discrimination in the country, the end of pandemic-era restrictions, a perception that the Biden administration welcomes asylum seekers, and an increase in previously established smuggling networks. Sectarian violence has also intensified, as right-wing groups targeting Muslims through rhetoric and provocation has led to an increase in communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims. Violent clashes and a surge in summary punishments of Muslims has driven many Muslims to leave the country. The factors driving Indian migrants to&hellip;",

    "content": "After record-breaking price appreciation over the last two years, the housing market has begun exhibiting signs of a possible recalibration. October 2022 marked the ninth straight month of decelerating monthly rent growth at 4.7%, down from January’s peak of 17.4%. Rising mortgage rates and shrinking buyer demand have led to some modest home price declines, especially in the metro areas that had previously experienced the highest price growth in the nation, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. However, these price trends do not mean housing is becoming more affordable. Current mortgage rates are pricing potential first-time homebuyers out of the home sale market, and the increasing number of households who are locked out of homeownership is exacerbating the pressure on a competitive rental market with few vacancies. To better understand housing price volatility across the country, BPC created a diffusion index using Zillow data on home values and rents to follow up on the first index we created earlier this year in May. BPC found the following trends: Although some metropolitan areas are registering housing price decreases across multiple months while others are experiencing pronounced drops, the national home-price average is still higher than it was last year. While the rate of growth for home prices has decreased across multiple months, home prices are still increasing on a year-over-year basis. Home values increased 13.5% year-over-year nationally and rents saw a 9.8% increase in October 2022. Year-over-year home values increased in 887 of 890 metro areas (99.6%), and rents increased in 104 of the 107 metro areas (97.2%) for which information was available. Our biggest takeaway: recent reversals in housing price trends are not ushering in an era of improved housing affordability for renters or would-be first-time homebuyers. About Our Methodology A diffusion index shows how broadly a particular indicator is changing—i.e., an overall trend—as opposed to a specific level of change. For the diffusion indices above, BPC first calculated the year-over-year changes in all metro areas for which the Zillow Home Value Index and Zillow Observed Rent Index were available. Metro areas with increasing prices were then assigned a value of 1, unchanged prices were given a value of 0.5, and decreasing prices were given a value of zero. The index shows the average of these assigned values across all metros. For example, an index at 95% means 95% of metros have increasing prices. Metro areas with missing data were excluded from our calculations. Housing remains unaffordable. High rents squeeze renters and higher mortgage rates inflate new homeowners’ monthly payments. Because of these higher borrowing costs, a typical home’s monthly mortgage payment comprises a significantly higher share of household income than it did in the two decades preceding the pandemic. For example, it costs $888 a month more nationally to buy an entry-level single-family home than to rent it. With their diminished buying power, consumers are facing reduced options in home quality and size, loans, and their ability to move. At 7%, mortgage rates are at their highest in&hellip;",

    "content": "Online data collection practices have come under scrutiny in recent years, with greater attention to the ethical implications of such practices. Many are realizing the extent of surveillance practices and what entities are using information collected by web browser cookies and tracking technology. Greater public attention has led to more significant data policy discussions: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently voiced concerns about the private sector’s data collection practices and was seeking public comment on the harms attributed to commercial surveillance practices. The White House also released a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights that included data privacy as one of its five main pillars. Concerns about data collection, use, and sharing practices are not limited to the private sector – government access to digital records has come under scrutiny recently, spotlighted after the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs. Policymakers must now get to the root of data collection, use, and sharing issues. This piece highlights some of the major pain points discussed among lawmakers, civil society, industry, and experts in the field. We review law enforcement’s use of court orders to gain information from some of the largest tech companies, thanks to publicly released reports. Then we examined how data brokers sell individuals’ personal information to governments for profit. Finally, we explored legal and policy challenges in this new digital age, focused around four main areas: privacy, security, transparency, and Fourth Amendment rights. Public Sector Data Sharing and Transparency Reports Starting as early as 2010, some companies began voluntarily releasing the number of government requests they received to disclose data about their users. This disclosure practice offers the public some transparency into government requests for online information and how often companies actually comply with those requests made by law enforcement. Transparency reporting soon became an industry-wide practice, even predating the 2013 NSA surveillance revelations that left the public skeptical of governments’ surveillance practices. Requests for information often come in the form of a subpoena or search warrant but, in some instances, can be made without a court order in the form of an emergency disclosure request. They may also target multiple or many accounts in a single information request. Large technology platforms retain a wealth of information about people that may be desirable to external actors. Between January and June 2021, U.S. law enforcement issued: 63,657 requests for information from Meta (formerly Facebook), covering 111,117 user accounts (out of approximately 233 million U.S. accounts in 2021) 50,907 requests from Google, covering 115,594 user accounts (out of over 246 million unique U.S. visitors in 2021) 27,809 requests from Microsoft 18,742 requests from Snap Inc. (parent company of Snapchat) 3,000 requests from Twitter 577 requests from TikTok In all, 164,692 requests were made in the first six months of 2021 from these six companies alone, targeting over 268,437 user accounts.

    "content": "Time is running out for Congress to change a key provision of the tax code, with implications for small businesses and overall U.S. competitiveness. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 phased out the immediate expensing of R&amp;D expenses in 2022. Without congressional action, R&amp;D expensing, which incentivizes private investment in the development of new technologies, will have to be amortized over a period of five to 15 years, depending on where the R&amp;D activities took place. There is bipartisan consensus that this change will harm small businesses and startups by making R&amp;D expensing less valuable and claiming it more complicated. Businesses may engage in less R&amp;D as a result—with detrimental effects for American innovation. So how did we get here and what can be done? According to the Congressional Research Service, immediate expensing of R&amp;D expenditures has been a feature of the tax code since 1954. That changed at the end of 2021. Here’s Rep. Ron Estes (R-KS) discussing the shift to amortization in a July BPC event about business creation and growth. To stop this change and keep immediate expensing of R&amp;D activities, Reps. Estes and John Larson (D-CT) introduced H.R. 1304, the American Innovation and R&amp;D Competitiveness Act, in 2021. Strong bipartisan support exists for the bill, which has more than 100 cosponsors. In the other chamber, Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Todd Young (R-IN) have also introduced legislation to maintain immediate expensing. Their bill would also double the refundable R&amp;D credit for startups and expand eligibility for claiming it. Many small businesses find it difficult to know what tax credits are available to them. The temporary nature of some credits adds further complication and confusion. Keeping the familiar tax treatment of R&amp;D expenses is one way, then, to minimize disruption and complexity for small businesses—many of which have recently been overwhelmed navigating a host of pandemic-era programs and credits. Whether changes to R&amp;D expensing ushered in by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will remain or be altered in an end-of-year tax package is uncertain. One possibility that has circulated in recent weeks would reinstate immediate expensing in exchange for enhancing the Child Tax Credit to mirror its 2021 expansion as part of the American Rescue Plan. With bipartisan and bicameral support for preventing the changes to R&amp;D expensing from taking place this year, there may be reason for small businesses to hope.",

Young adults are also struggling: Individuals ages 18-25 have the second highest prevalence of major depressive episodes, at 17%. Moreover, studies suggest that young adult women and members of the LGBTQ+ community experience higher rates of behavioral health challenges. Other studies suggest significant disparities in treatment for behavioral health care among young adult people of color. Additionally, research shows that half of all lifetime mental health conditions most often begins between the mid-teens and mid-20s. As it stands, our health and behavioral health care systems generally are only catching the adolescent half of this youth group and are often allowing young adults—those in their late-teens to mid-20s—to be overlooked. Intervention with our nation’s adolescents is imperative to protecting their long-term wellbeing. However, the mental health of our nation’s young adults remains just as vulnerable and, therefore, in need of greater attention from policymakers. Here&#8217;s why young adults are falling through the behavioral health care cracks: At 18, many young adults are preparing for or are undergoing a considerable transition out of formal schooling and into the working world or higher education (in 2020, 40% of 18-24-year-olds were enrolled in college). Many are also preparing to live on their own and financially support themselves, navigating first jobs, and experiencing new social settings and dynamics. Some may be thinking about long-term career goals while others are considering or actively building families. In short, this age group is experiencing more change in just a handful of years than they may ever experience again. Yet, the change doesn’t stop there: These young adults are often losing, unable to enroll in, or choosing not to enroll in health care coverage. While the ACA allows millions of young adults to retain health coverage through their parents’ insurance, the U.S. Census Bureau found that individuals ages 19-34 still have the highest uninsured rate as compared to all other age groups. But even when these young adults do have insurance, they are transitioning into adulthood without solid access to a primary health care provider. This is a major problem, as primary care is an entryway into the health care system that young adults utilize less than other age groups. They tend to be healthier overall and, as such, may find the investment of time and money into finding a primary care provider less pressing than other immediate needs, such as paying for housing. Furthermore, finding a primary care provider can feel confusing, daunting, and time-consuming. Without this vital link to care that existed in their adolescence, many young adults are forgoing access to health and behavioral health services at the&hellip;",

    "content": "ESG as concept has been around a lot longer than the 2004 United Nations document that many cite as its origin. ESG’s current form has had a meteoric rise in mainstream policy discussions, attributable to good marketing, its weighted investment in technology stocks that were overperforming, and the exclusion of energy stocks which were underperforming the market. Unfortunately, the ESG market has not maintained this dominance, calling into question whether one could “do well by doing good.” According to Professor Damodaran there is little evidence to support this often-stated strategy. If it is true that one could, he argues, you wouldn&#8217;t need to carve out a space for ESG; it would show up in the numbers. That said, impact investing and addressing climate change are both good and necessary. Provided of course, that one is honest with investors that the constraints of ESG on investing strategies will ultimately result in lower returns over the long term. Further, impact investing must be accounted for all the way through the intended impact. Unfortunately, what often happens is the impact affects one company but if the action targeted was a profitable product or service, there will always be another company there to step in and fill the vacuum. Further, these companies that step in are sometimes far less scrupulous than the originally targeted company. Therefore, it is important to remember that ESG is good for some companies, neutral for others, and will end up hurting the rest because of the constraints placed on them by ESG. ESG under its current form is too subjective. If it is to survive, it needs to be broken up into its individual parts. The “E” should focus on climate and other environmental issues with simple to understand disclosure metrics. The “S” should be removed entirely from the disclosure because not only is it subjective to determine what &#8220;good&#8221; is, but it is divisive because 50% of the country or more disagree on social issues. Lastly, the “G” should be returned to a discussion between management and shareholders acknowledging the importance of stakeholders.",

    "content": "PGIM is the global investment management business of Prudential Financial, one of the top 10 largest asset managers in the world with over $1.5 trillion in assets under management. Eugenia has recently published a white paper on ESG and greenwashing. While companies and investors are guilty of greenwashing—both unintentionally and intentionally—the perception is larger than the reality. This is due to different understandings of ESG&#8217;s definitions and investors&#8217; expectations. Like all investing, ESG is subjective and therefore must be individually tailored to meet investors&#8217; objectives. Asset managers should focus on what the investors want from ESG and what trade-offs they are willing to take, be it lower returns or higher risk. ESG can add value in two ways: 1) manage investment risk and identify opportunities; and 2) generate environmental and social benefits. While environmental and societal benefits are currently more popular in Europe, they also add to the complexity of ESG given that different investors have different time horizons and risk-adjusted returns expectations. ESG is not a one-size fits all— rather “it&#8217;s like 1,000 sizes … to fit a million different needs.&#8221; Moreover, the subjectivity in ESG “ratings and rankings” causes a very low correlation among ratings. The best-known raters and rankers still focus on &#8220;risk and opportunity,&#8221; and a high ESG score still equals low ESG risk. Impact investing has traditionally focused on its intended impact, including environmental or social benefits. However, impact investing is now also considered a solutions-based strategy which tends to be both high-risk and high-reward. International commitments are coming under fire because banks and other companies are hesitant to agree to UN “mandates” that limit financing for &#8220;non-ESG&#8221; companies, such as fossil fuels and weapons manufacturers. While the commitments are admirable, each company must carefully decide how to engage with their commitment. While CEOs do sometimes use greenwashing to shield poor financial performance, asset managers are usually able to decipher this by analyzing the numbers.",

    "content": "In January 2023, New Hampshire will launch its unique Paid Family and Medical Leave Plan, joining 12 other states and the District of Columbia with laws that expand access to this benefit. While many of those states use a public social insurance model to provide paid leave, New Hampshire is one of a growing number turning to private insurance to administer the benefit. Unique even among private models, the state is contracting with a single private insurer to establish a voluntary family and medical insurance (FMLI) benefit for state government and private-sector workers. This new development highlights another creative option to grow access to paid family and medical leave. Existing Private Insurance Approaches In 2016, New York established a mandatory statewide program that requires businesses to purchase insurance either from a state fund or a private insurer, with the state government strictly regulating benefit levels, coverage, and premium rates. Virginia enacted a law in 2022 that establishes paid family leave as a class of private insurance. As a result, employers can voluntarily participate in plans that are entirely designed and administered by private insurers. New Hampshire’s Paid Family Leave Plan New Hampshire’s new law is distinct from both New York’s and Virginia’s. Unlike in New York, New Hampshire’s paid leave system is optional, and unlike Virginia, New Hampshire will play a central role in establishing that insurance market.1 Following a request for proposal (RFP) authorized by the law, New Hampshire contracted with a single private insurer – MetLife Insurance – to administer a voluntary paid family and medical leave base plan starting on January 1, 2023. FMLI will function like traditional insurance plans, as employers and/or individual employees that opt-in will pay a premium to insure against the event that they must take time off work for a qualifying event. In return, under the base plan, workers will receive up to six weeks of benefits that replace 60% of wages. Weekly benefits will be capped at 60% of the Social Security Taxable Maximum ($147,000 in 2022 – or $2,830 per week), allowing for a maximum weekly benefit of about $1,700 per worker. Qualifying events included in MetLife FMLI Plans: A personal serious health condition when disability coverage does not apply, including childbirth; The birth of a child and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth; The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child within one year of placement; Caring for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition; or Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on “covered active duty,” or to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the service member’s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).

    "content": "On October 3, 2022, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear two cases that could fundamentally change the future of the modern internet. Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh involve both the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act— which shields tech platforms from lawsuits for hosting and moderating user content. Section 230 is one of the most important laws in tech policy, and this will be the first time the Supreme Court has interpreted its scope. Back in 1996, at the dawn of the internet age, Section 230 was created to encourage the development of the internet while fostering a safe online environment where users can connect and civilly express themselves. More than 25 years after its enactment, there is some concern that social media platforms play a role in the radicalization of extremists, which can lead to offline violence. The legal question presented here is whether Section 230 protects online services from lawsuits based on recommendations made by their algorithms. As Section 230 makes its way to the Supreme Court, what’s at stake, and should Congress step in first? Understanding Section 230 Section 230 has two key provisions that govern the internet: 1. Section 230(c)(1): “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Known as the 26 words that created the internet, online platforms cannot be held liable for the words and actions of their users. These legal protections were created to protect the innovation of the internet by preventing an influx of lawsuits for user-generated harm. Without Section 230, social media companies could be sued for every message and post made on their services. 2.  Section 230(c)(2): “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of…any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected…” Known as the Good Samaritan provision, this clause was enacted to provide broad immunity to platforms when they choose to moderate content in good faith. Lawmakers wanted to avoid a lawless no-man’s-land on the internet and ensure that platforms are safe online environments – and that they are not penalized in the endeavor to do so. Platforms are encouraged to voluntarily block and screen objectionable content; however, they are granted immunity if they do not. Understanding Algorithmic Content Moderation In today’s highly advanced world, algorithmic content technologies play an increasingly prominent role in our everyday lives. Under Section 230 protections, online services have built and deployed powerful content moderation systems, combining both automated and human moderators. Online platforms use automated filtering to process user-generated data, retain user attention, and detect online abuse. More controversially, algorithms also recommend content to users based on their preferences and search history. For example, a&hellip;",

    "content": "Last year, the Bipartisan Policy Center called for improved national broadband maps to accurately represent broadband internet services&#8217; availability. This information would enhance the equitable distribution of federal investments to strengthen U.S. broadband infrastructure. We are pleased to see progress made by the pre-production draft release of the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) improved National Broadband Map.   Congress passed the Broadband DATA Act in 2020, requiring the FCC to refine its data collection practices and update the map to reflect precise broadband availability. Over the year, service providers submitted more granular data to the FCC that present specific broadband availability at each location. Previously, the FCC broadband maps displayed data at the census block level, misrepresenting broadband availability in underserved locations. If just one address on a census block reported the availability of broadband services, the FCC maps showed every home and building on that block to have access. This inaccurately characterized the discrepancies in availability, particularly in rural areas where the census blocks cover wide areas of land. With its new process, the FCC designed the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric (Fabric) to standardize the data collection process for service providers and improve the granularity of the data collected.   The new map interface allows individuals to submit disputes regarding service availability at their addresses. Bulk challenges can also be made by “state and tribal governments and other entities.” Challenges may be submitted until January 13, 2023, after which the FCC will review the feedback and correct inaccuracies before releasing a final version. In 2023, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) will use the maps to distribute $42 billion from the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program passed as part of last year’s bipartisan infrastructure package.  While much of the success made over the year will improve the distribution of broadband infrastructure and funding, work still needs to be done to support equitable access to broadband internet services. The current maps do not describe many challenges Americans face when accessing broadband services, such as the high cost of service, experienced coverage limitation, or slow speeds and latency issues. The FCC must be diligent about collecting information about broadband access alongside availability. Using this data, consumers could make more informed decisions, driving greater competition between service providers. Information about why many Americans remain underserved or disconnected from the internet will also inform government funding and subsidy distributions and prevent overbuilding in areas where high-speed broadband services already exist. The FCC also needs a clearer picture of the services that innovative technologies, such as 5G or low earth orbiting satellite networks, provide to inform future discussions about spectrum allocation. Continued progress in innovating their data collection capabilities will also inform investments in new technology and future funding to support further broadband coverage for all Americans. ",

    "content": "There have been several significant changes to how migrants are dealt with at the border this fiscal year, as the Biden administration responds to changing dynamics and explores ways to expedite the legal processes in the face of an unprecedented migration challenge. Below is an overview of the changes, including a new final asylum rule, an evolving approach to Venezuelans at the border, increased use of ports of entry and parole programs for asylum-seekers, and the administration’s response to rises in unaccompanied children. New final asylum rule Chief among the changes is a new final rule on asylum that aims to speed up and smooth the asylum process for border arrivals by allowing asylum officers to adjudicate claims, rather than sending all cases to immigration judges. The administration hopes this rule will alleviate immigration court backlogs and more quickly process asylum claims, allowing those eligible for asylum to be granted relief rapidly and those who are not to be removed from the country swiftly. The rule is currently being implemented in phases, starting with individuals from two detention facilities in Texas. The process under the new final asylum rule begins after the individual is placed into expedited removal proceedings with a credible fear interview, which is meant to determine whether the individual meets a minimum legal threshold—having a credible fear of persecution or torture. An asylum officer from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) interviews the individual while they are in detention. If an officer does not find credible fear, the migrant may appeal the decision to an immigration judge. If an officer does find credible fear, the migrant moves on to an asylum merits interview with an asylum officer, which is to be conducted in a non-adversarial manner. The officer’s initial positive credible fear determination serves as the base of the asylum application, and migrants have seven days (if submitting in person) or 10 days (if submitting by mail) to correct the record or submit additional evidence before their asylum interview. The interview takes place between 21 days and 45 days after the credible fear determination. If asylum is not granted, the individual is placed into streamlined removal proceedings in immigration court, where an immigration judge will review the asylum claim to decide whether the claim should be granted. The judge must issue a decision within 90 days. The rule greatly expands the power granted to asylum officers, and could substantially shorten the time that it takes to rule on an asylum claim. The process under the new asylum rule is designed to take less than six months to reach a decision, accounting for the time it takes to conduct the credible fear interview, gather evidence for the asylum merits interview, conduct the asylum merits interview, and then have a judge review the case if it is not approved by the asylum officer first. This starkly contrasts to the time it takes to move a case through immigration courts, where the backlog has surpassed 1.9 million cases, and wait&hellip;",

    "content": "Last week marked the one-year anniversary of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (officially the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act). The BIL was not only a historic federal commitment to improving the nation’s infrastructure, but it also represents a major bipartisan achievement. The White House marked the anniversary by releasing new figures on the amount of BIL funding made available so far—$185 billion—and new map showing the nearly 7,000 projects that have been awarded grants. Obviously, these are big numbers, but they raise some important questions. Is the administration on track in implementing BIL? Are there still challenges to overcome? What should we expect in the law’s second year? To help answer these questions, BPC reached out to five experts whom we interviewed in January of this year, as BIL implementation was just beginning. All five served at one time or another in the federal government overseeing infrastructure programs. We asked them four key questions about the administration’s progress. Click on the takeaways below to see quotes from each of the experts. 1. One year into BIL implementation, many programs have been launched and billions of dollars have gone out. But there is more to do: some programs are still awaiting NOFOs or guidance, and various studies and pilots have yet to be launched. Based on your experience implementing infrastructure programs, how would you assess the administration’s progress to date? All of the experts agreed that reasonable progress has been made. “Given the enormity of the bill, and the need to develop guidance for so many new programs, the administration has done a remarkable job. They published important timelines for issuing the guidance and have focused on meeting those timelines, which in many cases meant an incredibly quick turnaround.” &#8211; Jane Garvey, former FAA Administrator; former FHWA Acting Administrator and Deputy Administrator “It is as good as can be expected with so many new programs&#8230;Not only do they have to establish new programs and new guidance, they also need to add whole teams of new people to implement them, in this economy where hiring is incredibly difficult and the labor market is incredibly tight.” &#8211; Beth Osborne, former DOT Acting Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy “Standing up a new grant program is very difficult. Federal agencies have done a good job getting these new programs stood up and putting out the NOFOs. They also have established websites to make information publicly available.” &#8211; Susan Bodine, former EPA Assistant Administrator “Speaking as someone that has implemented a bill previously, there’s a tremendous amount of effort and work needed to get the process moving. It cannot happen overnight. However, the machinery is starting to move now, the money is beginning to flow.” &#8211; Jim Ray, former DOT Senior Advisor “I think the general themes of the program are playing out, with an emphasis on resilience, sustainability and equity. I applaud the efforts to date, I think they are moving along with the specific regulations and outlines for the new programs—like&hellip;",

    "content": "On November 3, BPC’s Dennis Shea spoke with CEO of Habitat for Humanity International Jonathan Reckford for a virtual fireside chat. In addition to Habitat’s well-known home construction program, the nonprofit also plays an important role in neighborhood revitalization, mortgage financing, and public policy advocacy. Here is what Mr. Reckford had to say about enhancing housing affordability for families in the U.S. 1: Focus on increasing housing supply “We are in a housing affordability crisis,” Reckford said. Even in markets like Florida, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas, where Habitat used to be able to build affordable homes, prices have significantly increased. In response to the crisis, he suggested a focus on increasing the supply of homes both for sale and rent: “I would say first and foremost, our focus is on supply,” Reckford said. “If you look back, we have underbuilt… at least &#8230; 3.8 million units.” One of the ways Habitat works to increase supply is through modular housing. “I remember after Hurricane Katrina…we partnered with modular builders for some of those rural communities. They could build homes to 70 or 80% , because the key bottleneck was actually plumbers, electricians, and drywallers,” Reckford explained. He also cited increased efficiencies resulting from building parts of a home in a factory, transporting the house, and setting it up. Recently, Reckford noted a successful partnership of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Habitat affiliates, and modular builders to build “a neighborhood at a time instead of just a house at a time.” 2: Support mixed-income, mixed-use housing “A huge focus is we want to create more mixed-income, mixed-use housing,” Reckford said, because it is important for social mobility. “…Children from families with low incomes who grow up in mixed- income communities, still have relatively high social mobility. Families growing up in concentrated poverty have almost no social mobility.” In historically underserved communities, building mixed-income housing can also reduce or avoid the risk of displacement to existing residents. Reckford used the example of a development in Charlottesville, Virginia, which grew out of a partnership with the city and residents of a trailer park. “They redeveloped the trailer park, increased the density, and guaranteed that nobody would be displaced. So, they created a mixed- income …made sure there was affordable rental and made sure the residents weren&#8217;t kicked out.” Reckford recommended “build more density along transit in the main corridors” and simultaneously lowering the barriers (such as voucher non-acceptance and zoning laws) to move to communities of opportunity, “so if people wanted to move to another community, they actually could.” 3: Preserve existing affordable housing stock Habitat’s policy agenda includes preserving existing affordable homes, and Reckford highlighted the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act (NHIA). The NHIA is designed to solve an affordability problem common in cities and rural areas, where, as Reckford explained, “you could buy a house for a relatively reasonable amount,” but then bringing it up to code “will cost more than it will appraise&hellip;",

    "content": "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) authorized more than $7.5 billion in grants for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, including $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula program. The NEVI grant provides states formula funding to support the installation of publicly accessible chargers, with the aim of building out a network of corridors with consistent highway access to EV charging. All 50 states submitted their action plans for the NEVI grant program in August—clear evidence of broad interest in building out EV infrastructure. In September, the Biden administration announced that it had approved every state’s plan. States are starting to implement the programs, with some expecting to make funding available in the first half of 2023. This blog explores some of the different ways states are planning to use NEVI funding. Contracting models State governments are generally not planning to own or operate any EV chargers directly, instead setting up competitive grants to install and maintain chargers. Many of the contracting details will be decided during the implementation phase, but the state NEVI plans broadly outline some different models. Some states already have significant experience contracting with multiple vendors to install and operate charging stations and plan to continue that model, coordinating new federal dollars with their existing programs: California already awarded over $1 billion in funding on a first-come, first-serve basis for eligible EV charging projects. Based on this experience, the state’s energy and transportation agencies plan to jointly develop a competitive grant, identifying gaps in the network where chargers are needed and allowing contractors to select installation sites that meet the state’s standards. Colorado, which also has experience administering EV charging grants, outlined a similar contracting model, awarding grants to private, public, and non-profit entities to build, own, operate, and maintain chargers, selecting grantees based on scoring criteria. Texas will invite vendors to identify installation sites within agency standards, building on its experience implementing EV charging infrastructure with settlement funds from Volkswagen. Vendors are then responsible for working with property owners, utilities, and municipalities to complete siting, permitting, environmental clearance, installation, and operation of chargers. By contrast, Massachusetts plans to work with a single private partner to construct, maintain, and operate all of its charging infrastructure—though there are a range of options for this public-private partnership (P3) structure under consideration. It may include multiple subcontractors and site hosts for charging stations as well as a separate contracting approach to install a portion of its chargers on land owned by the state DOT. Oregon is considering a similar P3 model. The state DOT has an office designated to developing P3s that plans to facilitate a partnership with one or multiple EV service providers—companies, such as ChargePoint, Blink, or EVgo, that develop, install, and operate chargers with various business models. While Nebraska outlined a primary contracting option of working with multiple vendors, it noted that a new state law allowing for transportation P3s could lead to an alternative process. In its plan, Nevada laid out a different potential&hellip;",

    "content": "Last week BPC staff joined Dartmouth Health for the launch of their new Center for Advancing Rural Health Equity in New England. Clinicians, researchers, population health experts, consumer advocates, and community members gathered to discuss how to achieve health equity in rural communities, including closing the gap in addiction treatment and continuing federal telehealth flexibilities beyond the public health emergency. The timing of this event was fitting: Since 2010, the National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health has designated the third Thursday of November as National Rural Health Day. This year’s celebration centers around the theme of “Advancing Behavioral Health Equity in Rural Communities.” Rural America is home to nearly 61 million people. While rural living has its benefits—a slower pace, deep community ties, rich agriculture—it is not without its challenges, especially when it comes to accessing health care. The number of individuals experiencing mental health and substance use challenges has increased during the pandemic, intensifying the need for access to quality behavioral health services. Approximately 4 in 10 adults reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in January 2021—nearly four times as many as before the pandemic started; more than a quarter of young adults and 22% of essential workers reported suicidal thoughts. Like with mental health conditions, the pandemic also intensified the opioid crisis, with overdose deaths rising 30% between 2019 and 2020. Overdose mortality reached an all-time high, surpassing 100,000 overdose deaths across a 12-month period. The Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking estimates that drug overdoses cost the U.S. approximately $1 trillion annually. Despite these rising numbers, access to behavioral health services remains a significant challenge in rural America. In 2021, more than one-third of Americans (37%) lived in areas—disproportionately rural and frontier communities—experiencing shortages of mental health professionals. Current capacity does not meet the growing demand for services: As of 2020, fewer than half of adults with mental health conditions (totaling over 24 million Americans) received services, and 86.6% of patients with opioid use disorder were not receiving treatment. Recent telehealth flexibilities linked to the COVID-19 federal public health emergency benefitted many Americans by minimizing the need to travel for services or take time off for care. There is ample research showing tele-mental health services are of comparable quality to in-person treatment. Interestingly, 40%-50% of all behavioral health visits for traditional Medicare beneficiaries in 2021 were virtual. Access to virtual care allows patients to see providers outside their immediate community and avoid the stigma of receiving this type of care in-person, especially in rural, tight-knit communities. At BPC, we continue to make rural health issues a priority and support evidence-based policies that extend quality health care services in rural communities. While there is more work to be done, providers like Dartmouth Health and others across rural America continue to tackle head-on the challenges in health care, such as workforce shortages and record-high overdose deaths. We look forward to continuing our work with federal policymakers and industry leaders to promote innovations around rural health care delivery.&hellip;",

    "content": "Since 1988, Congress has required a portion of all federal contracts to go to small businesses, opening the door to a multi-billion-dollar market. After failing to meet the 23% small business procurement goal between fiscal year (FY) 2006 and FY12, the federal government has met or exceeded the goal for nine consecutive years. In FY21, small businesses earned $154.2 billion, or 27.23%, of federal contracts—the highest share in at least a decade and a half. Those top-line numbers are trending positive. Yet a market this large, with so many different buyers, has significant variation. The Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Small Business Procurement Scorecard is an important tool for understanding the small business contracting market and holding federal agencies accountable for meeting their procurement goals. Examining the Scorecard SBA works with federal agencies to set procurement goals and then reports annually on agency performance against those goals in its Procurement Scorecard. Together with SBA, agencies set prime and subcontracting goals for small businesses. The scorecard also reports performance against subcategory goals for contracting with women-owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones). In FY21, all but three of the 24 agencies assessed in the Procurement Scorecard received an A or A+ grade for their performance in small business contracting. These grades are determined by a formula that accounts for prime and subcontracting awards, a comparison against historical data, and the results of a compliance review. While the scorecard is an important monitoring tool, the grades can obscure poor performance against subcategory goals. In FY21, for example, the Department of Energy and NASA received A grades, yet both agencies failed to meet prime contracting goals for women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and small businesses located in HUBZones. The scorecards also paper over concerning trends in the number of small businesses participating in federal contracting. As outlined in a BPC report on small business contracting, the number of small businesses providing common products and services to the federal government shrank by 38% between FY10 and FY19. In FY21, 83% of agencies awarded fewer prime contracts to small businesses than the year before. Four agencies—each of which received an A or A+ grade—had declines of 10% or more. While goals are important for communicating priorities, they also have downsides. Small business owners and former agency officials have told BPC it is important to align goals with the diversity of small business ownership. Women, for example, own about 20% of employer businesses in the United States—yet the women-owned small businesses goal has remained at 5% for over 20 years. Even this small goal has only been met twice. Enhancing the Small Business Scorecard Members of Congress from both parties recognize the importance of having good data on small business contracting. One bipartisan effort to expand reporting, the Small Business Scorecard Enhancements Act, is included in the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) alongside other small business reforms.

    "content": "Note: In our border blogs, we only analyze data on encounters by U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) in between ports of entry, not all encounters at the southwest border, which include encounters by the Office of Field Operations (OFO) at Ports of Entry (POEs). Also, “expulsions” is the term used for sending migrants out of the country under Title 42, the CDC public health order, and “apprehensions” is used for all migrants processed under any part of immigration law, whether they ultimately are released into the United States, deported, or otherwise sent abroad. The number of Title 8 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border nearly doubled from fiscal year 2021 to FY2022, going from about 620,000 apprehensions in FY2021 to a little over 1,150,000 apprehensions in FY2022. Though the use of Title 8 has greatly increased this fiscal year, Title 42, the public health emergency order that allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to expel migrants without processing them under immigration law, was still used about 1,054,000 times in FY2022, seen below in Figure 1. Title 42 remains a centerpiece of the Biden administration’s approach to the border, despite the administration’s attempt to end it in April 2022 which was blocked by a federal judge in May 2022. Figure 1: Monthly Southwest Title 8 Apprehensions and Title 42 Expulsions (FY2022) Source: CBP(1)(2)(3) In this blog, we break down how the Border Patrol used its immigration authorities at the border in FY2022. When the CDC’s Title 42 order eventually comes down, apprehended migrants will again be processed entirely under the immigration authorities of Title 8. CBP tracks the disposition of all migrants processed under immigration law, and those dispositions offer insights into how the Biden administration’s approach has changed at the border this fiscal year, and how the administration might approach the border once Title 42 ends. Title 42 vs. Title 8 The Biden administration continues to rely heavily on Title 42 to manage the border, though it used the public health order for a smaller percentage of overall encounters at the border in FY2022 than in FY2021. (Figure 2). Title 42 was implemented at the border in March 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. Though the order took effect halfway through FY2020, it was used to expel nearly half of all migrant encounters at the border that year; there were just over 197,000 Title 42 expulsions in FY2020, and about 203,600 Title 8 apprehensions. Use of Title 42 greatly increased in FY2021, accounting for about 63% of all encounters, and decreased again in FY2022, accounting for only 48% of encounters. Figure 2: Southwest Border Apprehensions vs. Expulsions (FY2020-FY2022) Source: CBP(1)(2)(3) Usage of Title 42 increased quickly once it was implemented, as seen below in Figure 3. Border expulsions increased from just under 7,100 in March 2020 to nearly 48,500 in September 2022. Beginning in April 2020, the number of Title 42 expulsions outpaced the number of Title 8 apprehensions and remained the most-used authority at the border until July&hellip;",

    "content": "The purpose of the university is to foster the next generation of independent thinkers, capable of vibrant intellectual discourse across differences. Thrust into the whirlwind of college life, many matriculating students’ only real guidance comes during first-year orientation. The beginning of college is an important time for staff and faculty to define campus culture for these new students. However, today’s students are increasingly isolating themselves from the routine debate and challenge that should characterize university life. According to a January 2022 Knight/Ipsos poll, 65% of students “agree strongly or somewhat that their campus climate prevents some people from saying things they believe because others might find the remarks offensive.” That same study found that over 20% of students believe colleges should prohibit “biased” or “offensive” speech on campus. Surveys from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and Heterodox Academy revealed similar data, while a 2020 NBC News/Generation Lab poll showed that 46% of the class of 2025 would “probably” or “definitely” not room with a classmate who supported the opposing 2020 presidential candidate. To help students break through echo chambers and embrace viewpoint diversity and open inquiry, many colleges and universities are addressing free expression from the moment students set foot on campus. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Academic Leaders Task Force on Campus Free Expression advises colleges to incorporate free expression into orientations to “signal the importance universities place on free expression and open inquiry, and the skills and dispositions that support it.” Schools across the country have embraced a range of methods to bolster students’ skills for open inquiry during orientation. Methods to Incorporate Free Expression into First-Year Orientations Campus-wide Senior Leadership Addresses Presidents or other senior leaders sometimes give orientation addresses promoting free speech, sending the message to students that the university’s top officials stand behind campus-wide commitments to freedom of expression. At the same time, such a powerful bully pulpit ensures that these public pronouncements will generate discussion, and even controversy, on the campus and beyond. In 2022, Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber read Princeton’s Statement on Free Expression in front of first-year students. In 2016, Geoffrey Stone—former Provost of the University of Chicago, Dean of the University’s Law School, and co-author of the Chicago Statement—and Yale University President Peter Salovey gave free speech addresses at their respective schools. During a panel discussion early in the fall 2022 semester at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, President Janine Davidson told  students that “Shutting down people’s ideas and speech is not okay.” University of Denver President Jeremy Haefner published a May 2022 community-wide letter stating that civil discourse is central to the collegiate mission. These public statements, while effective, can also fuel controversy. Princeton students had mixed reactions to Eisgruber’s 2022 address. While one first year stated that he left the event “definitely in support of open dialogue on campus,” another first year wrote an op-ed stating: “The University has made it clear that while it may be committed to freedom of speech when it comes to right-wing&hellip;",

    "content": "Policymakers at all levels of government are exploring ways to increase housing supply and lower housing costs. One potential means to achieve these goals is to support and encourage the adoption of cost-effective innovations in building materials and home construction processes. Confusion over terminology, however, can hinder public understanding of these innovations and impede advancements. To further complicate matters, many terms are not mutually exclusive. To help provide more clarity on this subject, this blog provides basic definitions. On-site construction refers to building a home on the lot. The builder has all necessary materials, including concrete, lumber, drywall, and interior finishings like countertops and appliances, delivered to and used on the worksite. Benefits: It is the traditional construction process and is familiar to workers, developers, and local land development officials. On-site construction also offers flexibility for making changes due to site conditions as needed. Drawbacks: Construction schedules heavily depend upon worker and building material availability and weather conditions, which can complicate construction budgets and production timeframes. Stick-built describes the longstanding tradition of wood-framing residential housing. Builders primarily use softwood lumber to create the structural supports and skeletons of homes. Benefits: Careful stewardship supports healthy forests and provides economic opportunities for rural communities. Timber building products can be a valuable tool in carbon sequestration, in contrast to materials like cement that require high energy inputs to produce. Stick-built on-site construction offers the flexibility to make changes due to site conditions as needed. Drawbacks: Using lumber requires carpenters and other skilled workers, and the construction sector is facing a shortage of skilled labor and increasing wages. Meanwhile fluctuating costs for lumber and supply chain issues complicate construction budgets, leading to project planning uncertainties and higher housing prices. 3D-printed homes are built on site using a construction equipment size “printer,” a machine that pours layers of proprietary concrete to form the foundations and walls of homes. In some cases, smaller 3D printers, using other materials such as specialty plastics, can create discrete pieces of the home, such as doorknobs and countertops. Benefits: One firm estimated that using 3D printing resulted in a 15% cost reduction, while decreasing the project schedule to three months compared to seven months for a stick-built, on-site home. The process also lessens the number of skilled workers required for building a home. Drawbacks: 3D Printing is one of the newest technologies in residential construction. As a result, builders may find it difficult to determine costs and schedules during the development phase. Furthermore, local authorities often lack the knowledge to apply and evaluate 3D printed homes using existing building codes, deterring developers from using the process. Finally, concrete can be expensive and its production results in high carbon emissions, so 3D printing may have higher environmental costs compared to stick-built and other forms of home construction. A 3D printer pours concrete to ultimately create Habitat for Humanity’s first owner-occupied, 3D-printed home—a 1,200 sq. ft house constructed in only 28 hours in Williamsburg, VA.

A U.S. District judge granted the students a preliminary injunction that bars the college from banning “inappropriate or offensive language or themes.” The judge wrote that since the college approved other flyers, it cannot claim “unbridled discretion over the content of student flyers.” Penn State Event Featuring Proud Boys Founder Canceled Due To ‘Threat of Escalating Violence’ CDT Staff Reports | Central Daily Times | October 25, 2022 Pennsylvania State University campus police canceled an event with leaders of the Proud Boys citing a “threat of escalating violence.” Hundreds protested the event, which was sponsored by Uncensored America, a registered student organization. University President Neeli Bendapudi lamented, “the message too many people will walk away with is that one can manipulate people to generate free publicity, or that one can restrict speech by escalating protest to violence.” Affirmative Action Ignites Tension Among College Students, Alumni Meena Venkataramanan | The Washington Post | October 31, 2022 The U.S. Supreme Court Harvard University and University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill affirmative action cases are creating national headlines. For students and alumni of these two universities, however, these are intensely local events. Supporters and opponents of race-conscious admissions both describe anxiety and fear: for supporters, fear that students from historically underrepresented groups would no longer as easily be able to “find people who look like ” on campus; for opponents, “fear of being canceled.” State and Federal ‘Attempted Intimidation’: Missouri AG Sent Five Requests for MSU Emails, Records Tessa Weinberg | Missouri Independent | October 19, 2022 Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, recently elected U.S. Senator, requested the email correspondence of a Missouri State University professor, who had criticized Schmitt on the professor’s personal email account, and a vice president.

    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) The SBA is the only cabinet-level agency fully dedicated to small businesses. Its mission is to aid, counsel, assist, and protect the interests of small businesses; preserve free competitive enterprise; and maintain and strengthen the overall economy. SBA focus areas include counseling, capital, and contracting. What Is Reauthorization? The power to create, continue, or modify a government agency, program, or activity belongs to Congress and is referred to as its authorization authority. When Congress authorizes a new agency or government activity, it defines the purpose, organization, and responsibilities of the federal government regarding a specific issue or realm of related concerns. Authorization paves the way for federal funding to be appropriated and spent to fulfill the purpose of the authorized agency or program. Congress may authorize a program indefinitely or for a specified period. When Congress authorizes an agency or program for a defined period, reauthorization is needed for that agency or program to continue. Most congressional committees have authorization authority and regularly conduct oversight of agencies, programs, and activities Congress has authorized. The House Small Business Committee and the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee have authorization and oversight authority over SBA. When Was SBA Last Reauthorized? The SBA has been reauthorized numerous times since its creation in 1953. Between 1980 and 2000, for example, Congress reauthorized SBA seven times, with reauthorization periods ranging from two to five years. December 2000 was the last time Congress reauthorized SBA in its entirety. Congress has not passed a comprehensive reauthorization of SBA in 7,986 days. While Congress has not reauthorized the SBA in a wholistic manner in more than two decades, Congress has reauthorized various SBA programs since 2000. This piecemeal approach has kept the agency operating but without the benefit of a comprehensive evaluation and strengthening of its activities. The last time Congress attempted a comprehensive reauthorization of SBA was in 2019. Senator Marco Rubio (then Chairman of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee) led the effort. It was preceded by eight hearings in which his committee examined various programs and aspects of the SBA. Partisan disagreements over various regulatory reforms derailed the effort. What’s at Stake for Small Businesses? Reauthorization presents an important opportunity for stakeholders and Congress to modify an agency or program to better accomplish its stated mission or purpose. Without regular reauthorization, federal agencies and programs can operate in outdated ways that prevent an agency or program from fully accomplishing its purpose. One way to think about the effects of failure to regularly reauthorize an agency or program is to consider how your phone would work if you went years without updating its software. Eventually, what was once a state-of-the-art phone would become difficult to use and of little value to the owner. Emergency Relief and Preparedness The COVID-19 pandemic thrust SBA to the fore of many Americans’ lives as the agency led federal efforts to support small businesses through the crisis. SBA was responsible for distributing over $1 trillion&hellip;",

This legislation should help ensure the United States maintains its place as the world leader in developing revolutionary technologies and that those technologies are commercialized domestically to have the most positive economic impact for Americans. The first part of the CHIPS and Science Act contains provisions to bolster U.S. leadership in semiconductor R&amp;D, workforce, and manufacturing. Semiconductors are vital for clean energy infrastructure, including solar and wind energy systems and electrical grid components. Establishing a more durable domestic semiconductor supply chain will help ensure the domestic energy sector is insulated from the supply shocks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tension. The Department of Energy recently released a report on the role of semiconductors in energy supply chains. A summary of the semiconductor provisions in the CHIPS and Science Act is available here. This summary focuses on the energy, climate, and science provisions in the bill. Other than the direct funding provided in the bill for semiconductor advancements, the CHIPS and Science Act is primarily an authorization bill. To drive impact, the programs listed below will need to receive funding through the annual congressional appropriations process. Regional Investments Regional Innovation Capacity (Sec. 10621) Requires the Department of Commerce to establish 20 Regional Technology Hubs to expand U.S. innovation capacity to more areas of the country.

    "content": "As the end of the 117th Congress nears, dozens of bills remain stalled—including more than 15 with bipartisan support—that represent various attempts to reform FEMA-, HUD-, and SBA-administered disaster recovery programs. While some of these bills include meaningful and potentially impactful program improvements, they are generally narrow in scope and being advanced independent of one another—not as a coherent, comprehensive reform effort. Our nation’s disaster recovery system is complex and multifaceted, including a slate of federal programs, governed by a national disaster recovery framework, which collectively attempt to meet the needs of individuals and communities affected by disasters. Legislative reform requires a holistic, coordinated approach that considers how various programs interact and what is the optimal role for each federal agency. A package of legislative changes should complement each other and address the gaps and shortcomings of the current disaster recovery system. The table below outlines the major bipartisan disaster bills that are pending in Congress to help lawmakers understand what reforms are on the table, with the aim of informing a bipartisan legislative reform effort that improves recovery outcomes through a comprehensive and harmonized approach in the 118th Congress. Here are some takeaways from some of the major bipartisan bills. FEMA and HUD housing assistance A pair of House bills would expand FEMA’s ability to provide housing assistance: H.R. 8416, the Disaster Survivors Fairness Act, a package of FEMA reforms, includes a provision that would expand the use of FEMA’s direct assistance for housing repairs and also make damaged homes eligible for FEMA hazard mitigation assistance (as opposed to the current statute limiting eligibility to homes that were rendered uninhabitable). It would also extend authorization for a pilot program giving states and local governments the option to assume responsibility for post-disaster housing missions—which has had limited uptake given necessary pre-certification processes as well as stringent procurement and cost guidelines. H.R. 5774, the Expediting Disaster Recovery Act, which passed the full House, authorizes FEMA to provide financial assistance for “unmet needs”—a term that generally refers to HUD’s responsibilities in disaster recovery. The bill would give FEMA expanded flexibility to provide the type of disaster-related housing assistance often carried out by HUD, with the aim of allowing communities quicker access to resources to initiate recovery efforts while waiting for HUD’s assistance, which is subject to appropriations and thus takes longer to disburse. Meanwhile, H.R. 4707/ S. 2471, the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act, would permanently authorize HUD’s Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program, instead of relying on an endless series of supplemental appropriations and Federal Register notices that prevent the timely delivery of aid. CDBG-DR is the federal government’s primary program to provide long-term disaster recovery funding, including substantial housing assistance. Congress has appropriated about $100 billion to CDBG-DR since 2001. Permanently authorizing CDBG-DR has been a top priority for BPC Action—and advocates are hoping that a version of the authorizing legislation is included in must-pass National Defense Authorization Act or fiscal year 2023 appropriations legislation. It’s also worth noting&hellip;",

    "content": "Background on Influence Operations Most social media users have heard of bots, or automated software programs that mimic human behavior online. Bots have gained notoriety due to how they have been weaponized via automated postings to spread information disorder, harmful content, and general spam. Bots recently made mainstream media headlines due to Elon Musk’s recent acquisition of Twitter. Musk claimed that Twitter was lying about the number of spam-bot accounts on its platform, which is why he was reluctant to follow through on the acquisition. What people may not know is that bots are a part of a larger phenomenon called influence operations. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace defines influence operations as “organized attempts to achieve a specific effect among a target audience.” Influence operations leverage social media using a range of strategies such as bots, trolls, spamming, disinformation, fake reviews, advertising, cyberattacks, and a more recent tactic called coordinated inauthentic behavior. Online influence operations are anything but new. Going as far back as 2008, the Chinese government realized that conducting influence operations in the digital sphere was the best way to avoid anti-party sentiment and deter collective action. The Chinese government paid hundreds of thousands of people, dubbed the “50-cent party,” to create accounts and flood Chinese social networks with positive publicity of the CCP’s ideology and agenda, thus spinning the narrative in their direction. The skillful manipulation of social media soon expanded to radicalized individuals, terrorist groups, businesses, and foreign governments that employ a great deal of resources, teams, and infrastructure to conduct online propaganda. The digitization of modern society combined with the intrinsic anonymity granted by the internet has allowed for the proliferation of online influence operations to become more sophisticated and covert. However, not all online influence operations have malicious intent. Just as how bots are not intrinsically malicious, influence operations can be used for positive advocacy, social movements, and general information sharing – such as those designed to get citizens to be more civically engaged and vote. Considering recent evidence of foreign election inference, weaponizing the internet has become increasingly commonplace in and around election cycles. With the midterm elections here, it is paramount to promote media literacy so that one may be able to recognize disinformation online. As the threat grows more prevalent, malicious actors are developing new techniques to sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt in our society. Background on Coordinated Influence Operations Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior (CIB), a term coined by Facebook in 2018, is a more recent type of influence operation that has gained national attention lately. Most recently, Meta shut down Russian-backed coordinated inauthentic behavior that involved a small network of over 60 fake websites masquerading as legitimate news websites. They were posting articles criticizing Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia. It was the largest, most complicated Russian-coordinated disinformation campaign since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This phenomenon is frighteningly relevant – so what is coordinated inauthentic behavior, who is behind it, and why is it so dangerous? Coordinated inauthentic&hellip;",

    "content": "In our previous post on broadband, we provided a high-level overview of the current state of broadband in the United States, given the context of the $65 billion that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has provided to close the digital divide. But a major debate in this buildout concerns the precise speeds that US citizens need to work, play, and connect in modern cyberspace. This is not an easy question because the answer is always changing as new applications, infrastructure availability, and societal demands for online activity develop. Activities like telehealth and remote work are likely permanent fixtures in American life, so broadband demand is more pressing than ever. The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) formal definition of “broadband” serves as the federal standard for the minimally acceptable speeds for which an average household connection can meet modern-day demands. The goal of the National Telecommunication and Information Administration’s (NTIA) $65 billion buildout is to ensure that every American can fully participate in online life well into the future, so it is important that we try to get these numbers right as best we can. Background We have outlined the definitions of download (receiving) and upload (sending) speeds (usually expressed as a ratio of download/upload). We also hosted a number of stakeholders to discuss what is required to narrow the digital divide. The FCC’s current 25/3 definition was set in 2015, but just five years earlier, in 2010, the definition was a mere fraction of that at 4/1. At the turn of the century, the term “high-speed Internet” referenced broadband download speeds of just 200 kilobits per second (see figure 1). Our production and consumption of data have increased by orders of magnitude, not gradually, over time, and there is no reason to believe that this trend will abate. To illustrate, the average US household used 38 times the amount of data in pre-pandemic 2020 —approximately 350 Gigabytes (GB) a month — than it did a decade earlier, and in 2021 that number was approaching 650 GB/month. This is important to remember when attempting to forecast future speed requirements. Let’s Talk Numbers To put the current broadband definition in context, a household with a 25/3 connection can download a 5-minute web video file (about 30 megabytes of data) to a local computer in about ten seconds. This might be surprising because, based on the stated numbers, you would assume it would only take around 1.2 seconds. However, there are often other connections sharing the line, interruptions to service, or competing factors that will slow down the connection speed. ISP Allconnect found the actual capacity of a fiber or cable Internet connection is only about 80% of its advertised speed, while the FCC’s most recent Consumer Fixed Broadband Performance report found that measured download speeds were 100% or better than advertised speeds during peak hours. These results are inconsistent because broadband speeds themselves are subject to circumstantial factors. They depend in part upon the number of simultaneous users, the type of connection, the investment&hellip;",

    "content": "In February 2021, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) released a report entitled, simply, Beat China. In it, Sen. Cotton called for actions to “beat China in the economic theater of the conflict” with the United States. Competing with China has since become a shared bipartisan priority. After passage of the CHIPS and Science Act by Congress in July (with 17 Senate Republicans voting for it), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) lauded the bill as helping the United States “outcompete China.” Republicans—who at the time of this writing look set to take narrow control of the House of Representatives—intend to stand up a select committee focused on competing with China. CHIPS and Science allocated tens of billions of dollars for incentives and subsidies targeted at semiconductor manufacturing. The legislation also authorized many billions more for increased R&amp;D spending at a handful of federal agencies. For Republicans and Democrats looking to stay ahead of China economically and technologically, this was a commendable step. Yet it’s far from enough. If policymakers take their own rhetoric about competing with China seriously, there is more work to do. Three areas should command immediate bipartisan attention and action. First, the domestic workforce. The United States has one of the world’s most productive and skilled workforces. Yet continued investments and upgrading are necessary to help workers enhance their skills. In the 118th Congress, lawmakers will have two opportunities to ensure the American workforce is equipped for the “economic theater” of competition with China. Both the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins Act) will be due for reauthorization. WIOA is the federal government’s flagship workforce training program, providing funds for states to develop workforce plans and build partnerships between employers and educational institutions. The Perkins Act supports career and technical education programs at secondary and postsecondary levels. Given that nearly two-thirds of adults do not have a bachelor’s degree, these programs are essential to connecting Americans to the workforce and supporting middle-skill jobs that are crucial for communities and competitiveness. There can be no thought of maintaining the United States’ economic edge relative to China without a workforce that not only has technical skills but also constantly upgrades those skills. Reauthorization of these bills is an opportunity to work with the private sector and design programs that do just that. Second, global talent. China is losing its luster as a destination for corporate executives, startup founders, and students from around the world. So, unfortunately, is Hong Kong due to Beijing’s repressive actions there. The United States, especially compared to China, remains attractive to global talent, yet policymakers have done little in recent years to enhance that attraction and capitalize on China’s diminishing allure. Two talent provisions were dropped from CHIPS and Science. One would have created an easier path to green cards for foreign-born STEM graduates of American universities. Another would have established a startup visa for foreign entrepreneurs to grow their companies in the United States. Such steps would&hellip;",

    "content": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) released year-end data for fiscal year 2022 on October 21, 2022, showing a record-breaking number of encounters at the border, driven in particular by a sharp increase in Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, and Cubans. These numbers illustrate the increasingly hemispheric nature of migration, which we noted at the end of FY2021, pointing out increases in the “other” nationality category that have persisted into this year. Figure 1, below, places the increase in encounters in context, with over 2.2 million encounters between ports of entry by U.S. Border Patrol in FY2022, far surpassing FY2021’s record of 1.66 million. Figure 1: Total Southwest Border Encounters (Between POEs) (FY1980-FY2022) Source: CBP(1)(2) Continued Diversification of Nationalities Encountered As much of the press coverage has noted, there was a continued increase in migration from countries other than Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras this year. About 1.26 million encounters were with migrants from those four countries, while about 950,000 encounters were with migrants from “other” countries. For comparison, in FY2019, about 775,000 encounters were with migrants from Mexico and Northern Triangle countries, while a little over 77,000 migrants from “other” countries were encountered. The growth in migration from “other” countries can be seen in Figure 2, with the number of migrants from “other” countries increasing 150% this fiscal year as compared to FY2021. Figure 2: Encounters by Nationality, Mexico vs. Northern Triangle vs. “Other” Countries (FY2019-FY2022) Source: CBP(1)(2) Press coverage of the increase in migration from countries other than Mexico and the three northern countries of Central America has focused particularly on nationals of Venezuela, and the Biden administration has responded to this increase specifically by instituting a new parole program (and new restrictions on applying for asylum at the border) for Venezuelans to discourage them from making the journey up through Mexico.. According to reports in mid-October, the Biden administration was considering offering the same kind of parole program for Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians—all countries that saw significant increases in migrants in the last year—though they were ultimately not included. There has been a sustained increase in migrants from Nicaragua and Cuba, starting around March 2021 (though there had been an increase in Cuban migrants since June 2020), as seen in Figure 3, below. Figure 3: Encounters by Nationality, Venezuela vs. Nicaragua vs. Cuba (FY2021-FY2022) Source: CBP(1)(2) The increase in migrants from Cuba has been especially notable—there were slightly over 38,000 encounters of Cubans at the southwest border in FY2021, and just over 220,000 encounters in FY2022, a nearly 500% increase. Cubans have fled the communist country to come to the United States for decades but more commonly arrived by boat. In 2015, the land border saw an increase in Cubans, as the Obama administration moved to normalize relations with Cuba and ended special immigration status for migrants fleeing Cuba, essentially gutting the Cuban Adjustment Act. In 2017, just before he left office, Obama ended the so called “wet-foot, dry-foot” policy that administrations for decades had used to repatriate Cubans&hellip;",

    "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promises transformative benefits to society but comes at a cost when a system initially designed to solve one problem has unintended consequences. For example, an AI system recently created to automate the drug discovery process by identifying proteins that indicate disease also identified 40,000 potential bioweapons. Impact assessments are one tool to anticipate and manage an AI system’s benefits, risks, and limitations throughout its entire life cycle. The Bipartisan Policy Center has been working for the past year with outside stakeholders to examine the benefits and challenges of potential AI impact assessments. After convening representatives from academia, civil society, government, and industry, we are sharing what we have learned about this emerging tool. In this piece, we address seven questions to help explain what an impact assessment actually is, and what it means for AI. What are impact assessments? An impact assessment is a risk management tool that seeks to ensure an organization has sufficiently considered a system’s relative benefits and costs before implementation. In the context of AI, an impact assessment helps to answer a simple question: alongside this system’s intended use, for whom could it fail? An organization might use an impact assessment to understand how an AI system will impact users and society more broadly at every stage: data-gathering, development, deployment, and continuous monitoring in society. These assessments can serve as critical guard rails for public and private organizations, with the investment required proportionate to risk. For instance, AI systems that offer movie recommendations would receive less scrutiny than those that make hiring or loan decisions. An impact assessment promotes accountability by requiring an organization to document its decision-making process and “show its work.” During BPC’s work in 2020 on an AI National Strategy for Congress, there was little consensus among experts on the baseline language, scope, and design of a potential assessment. As we learn how to identify and measure harm from AI systems, impact assessments can make the inner workings of the algorithms that power these systems more transparent. The goal is for impact assessments to promote accountability through documentation and knowledge production, rather than to instill fear of liability. This process seeks to create a regulatory incentive for organizations to answer basic questions about decision-making: why was a given regression criterion or training data set chosen and why were alternatives rejected? What is the difference between impact assessments and risk assessments? While risk assessments and impact assessments are closely related, they each convey certain assumptions about AI. A risk assessment assumes a more negative slant: that AI is inherently risky and leads to negative outcomes. As such, the goal is to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. An impact assessment assumes a more positive slant, seeking to weigh an AI system’s positive benefits alongside its negative risks. In what contexts outside AI have impact assessments been applied? While initially focused on the economic and administrative impacts of proposed regulations, impact assessments are now used in many policy contexts. Governments have introduced impact&hellip;",

    "content": "We’ve finally made it to the day we’ve all been waiting for: Election Day. … or, if you’re like us, the day we have been approaching with an ever-shifting mix of excitement, fear, hope, and trepidation – just like the slow, creaky incline of a roller coaster about to drop. Today marks a new age in American democracy. Regardless of which party wins majorities in Congress or has success in state and local races, contested elections – in which results are drawn into question by a candidate or political party – are the new status quo. Election administrators, courts, and other government bodies will need extra time to resolve contested results. And it’s not going to get better any time soon. Here’s what you need to know to get through the next few weeks: 1) Initial results will take longer in some areas than others. Election “night” is no longer: we must prepare for election week (or, weeks). The results you see on election night are always unofficial, they are verified and finalized in the weeks that follow Election Day. This period allows election offices to process and tabulate mail ballots, count provisional and military ballots, and check for any errors that might have occurred. No state has ever had final results on election night. Mail ballots take longer to process than ballots cast in-person, which has contributed to a longer period of uncertainty after the polls close. A longer period between the close of polls and the reporting of results does not indicate that something is wrong. Rather, it means that election officials are taking the time they need to produce a fair and accurate vote count. For more on results reporting and mail voting, read Mail Voting is Safe and Secure. For more on the certification process, read Behind the Curtain of Post-Election Canvassing, Audits, and Certification. 2) Expect results to be contested. In close races, candidates will contest the results and demand recounts. In 22 states + DC, recounts are automatically triggered in close races. In others, candidates or voters can request a recount. Contested election results do not indicate that there were problems with the election. Contested elections will work their way through the courts and the winner of the election determined by existing state and federal law will be sworn into office. 3) Elections are human operations, and humans make mistakes. Small hiccups during voting, vote counting, or results reporting are natural and expected parts of the process, and they don’t mean that there are widespread problems. The decentralized nature of our election system is one of its greatest strengths. Without any central election body or management system, U.S. elections are highly resilient to coordinated, comprehensive threats or attacks. Elections are run primarily at the state and local level, and rules for how voting and counting takes place vary by state and even by locality. When issues happen, they are quickly identified and addressed through rigorous and regular audits, checks and balances, and post-election canvass&hellip;",

Through this grant, we commissioned a survey through Morning Consult to assess who the public trusts to deliver information about how to vote, election administration, and election results. This survey was conducted at the national level, with an oversampling of three states: Colorado, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Top Three Takeaways 1. State and local chief election officials are highly trusted for delivering election information across political party affiliation, age, and other key demographics. When asked who voters turn to for various types of information about an election, voters are most likely to look to their state and local election officials, and search engines. For information on the winner of an election, voters nationally and across the states surveyed are most likely to go to national television, local television, or a search engine. There are also notable differences by age on this question: 18-34-year-olds report using search engines and social media at higher rates than other information sources for election information. When asked to choose between two different messengers of information about the winner of an election, voters report being more likely to look to sources they are more familiar with: their favorite national news anchor, their favorite local television news anchor, their state chief election official, and their local chief election official. Of 15 total messengers (including partisan and nonpartisan individuals, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Mark Zuckerberg), respondents selected their favorite national news anchor 57% of the time &#8212; regardless of who it was being compared against. Respondents selected their state and local chief election official 51 and 49 percent of the time, respectively. These messengers are also the most trusted across political parties nationally and within the states surveyed. Among the specifically named messengers tested, when Anderson Cooper presented in a matchup, he was selected by 34% of voters. Tucker Carlson of FOX News, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, and podcaster Joe Rogan were selected less often in matchups they appeared in over the course of the experiment. 2. 76% of voters (89% of Democrats and 67% of Republicans) are confident that their votes will be counted accurately in the 2022 midterm election. A majority of Republican voters are confident that their vote as well as votes in their state and local community were counted accurately in the 2020 election. Only 41% of Republican voters are confident that votes across the country were counted accurately in 2020. 44% of Republican and 10% of Democratic voters are not confident that votes across the country will be counted accurately in the 2022 midterm election.

    "content": "One year ago, we were delighted to help launch the Task Force on the Future of SBA at the Bipartisan Policy Center. As co-chairs of the Task Force, we have drawn on our experiences serving at the Small Business Administration and in the private sector to lead conversations about modernization of this critically important federal agency. Members of the Task Force—all of whom bring experience with small businesses and public policy—have met with advocates, former SBA officials, congressional staff, financial institutions, and more. Next year, the Task Force will be releasing recommendations for changes that could be made at SBA. Between now and then, the Task Force and BPC will be releasing a series of short, in-depth explainers that highlight issues we have looked at. This week we are releasing the first piece, a summary of the small business lending market and a snapshot of the types of credit products and sources used by small businesses. Other posts/explainers will examine topics ranging from the impact of COVID on small business financing to online lenders to government-guaranteed lending. To date, the Task Force has spent most of its time on access to capital. This is not surprising as we began our work while still under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic and only a few months after the close of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Through PPP and COVID Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), SBA was responsible for delivering over $1 trillion in emergency federal aid in response to the pandemic. That is roughly one thousand times more than the agency’s entire annual budget. This arduous task stretched the agency’s capacity nearly to the breaking point. By all accounts, however, SBA performed remarkably well—especially through two administrations of different political parties. Many small business owners describe PPP and EIDL as a “lifeline” and applaud the tireless work of SBA staff. Inevitably, the pandemic experience underscored not only SBA strengths but also areas for improvement. Longstanding gaps in access to capital, for example, were starkly highlighted during the crisis. The Task Force has been examining SBA’s lending support programs—principally the 7(a) loan guaranty—and looking at trends and whether the program is meeting both its mission and the needs of small businesses. We have been encouraged by actions taken by SBA and Congress that align with ideas the Task Force has discussed. For example, in August, an SBA rule took effect permitting higher interest rates on 7(a)-backed loans of different sizes. The SBA is also moving to propose a rule that would expand lender participation in the 7(a) program, something that has garnered bipartisan support in proposed legislation in Congress. Over two-thirds of small businesses today did not exist the last time SBA was formally reauthorized by Congress. Whether reauthorization is on the table again or not, it’s clear that SBA operates in a landscape of constant change. The challenges successfully weathered by the agency have put a spotlight on areas where reforms are needed—and where strengths can be enhanced. We look forward&hellip;",

BPC Board Member Karen Dunn Kelley, also former commerce deputy secretary under the Trump Administration, opened the conversation. “It is essential that we find policies that work for businesses and families and that can maintain durable bipartisan support,” said Kelley, as she noted the common goals across administrations. In his conversation with BPC’s Adrienne Schweer, Deputy Secretary Graves highlighted several efforts by the Commerce Department aimed at supporting working women and families as a tool to grow the economy. Key initiatives include better access to high-speed internet, training programs that include wrap-around services like child care, and programs to promote women in STEM careers. For example, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act provides more than $50 billion for the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem, and Deputy Secretary Graves emphasized that those resources must support the industry more broadly and ensure a more diversified workforce. As a recent BPC-Morning Consult poll showed policies such as paid leave, child care, and flexibility at work would have outsized positive impacts on working moms. For example, 53% of working mothers say they would be more likely to stay in the workforce if they had access to a paid family leave benefit. A complete recording of this event is available here.

Experts debated issues from training needs to norms for international cooperation, but one issue emerged as the most contentious: impact assessments. These experts disagreed on what an accountability mechanism should look like, and how precisely it should acknowledge and mitigate bias in AI systems. Therefore, for the past year we have focused our efforts on AI impact assessments. We held four convenings with experts from academia, civil society, government, and industry to identify areas of consensus around language, scope, and oversight for an impact assessment framework. Bodies from the European Union to South Korea have already started to release proposals for AI impact assessments. Now, as the U.S. government considers its own guidance, the Bipartisan Policy Center has identified six common goals shared by AI experts from across sectors. 1) Think beyond “hard law.” Will American companies conform to the European Union’s proposed AI Act, whose top-down approach could require companies to hand over their proprietary source code to regulators? Seeking to balance the trade-off between innovation and safety, panelists preferred the current process taken by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), which is piloting a voluntary risk-management framework with stakeholders before considering what binding rules might look like. 2) Think beyond a “one and done” document. What happens when a company releases a new credit card, but is accused of assigning a higher credit limit to a husband than his wife? When investigating an AI system for potential bias in credit lending, for example, it helps to think of impact assessments as less a document and more a process. Because AI systems learn, adapt, and iterate, an organization’s process of documenting decisions creates a record that it can rely upon when auditing a system. This not only helps an organization to ensure the system is operating as intended, but if something goes wrong, the organization can better pinpoint the faulty decision or input. Not everything can fit in a single tool or assessment. Therefore, a governance structure with continuous review and testing promotes accountability. 3) Think beyond accuracy as the measure of success. Consider a health services company with a noble goal: identify patients at higher risk to end up in the emergency room, and give them additional care resources. However, by using health spending as a proxy for health needs, the system could be biased against people of color who may not spend as much relative to their clinical risk. In 2018, the research firm Gartner predicted that through 2022, 85% of AI systems will fail—largely because if a company only tests for a single performance metric, it will miss biases in the dataset, algorithms, or teams responsible for managing them. Companies should, therefore, not only test for one metric, often accuracy, and instead include other important qualities such as explainability, transparency, robustness, and security.

BPC&#8217;s recent report on small business digitalization, Small Businesses Go Digital: Benefits, Trends, and Barriers of Digitalization, highlights how digital tools are helping small businesses grow and explores some of the challenges to greater adoption of digital technology. We look at how women business owners view some issues associated with digitalization, including some findings not previously reported. The data presented below comes from a July 2022 survey of 2,021 senior decision makers at U.S. small businesses with fewer than 100 employees. In April, BPC conducted a poll with Morning Consult on the condition of working mothers emerging from the pandemic. Entrepreneurship is an opportunity for career advancement for many working mothers, however longstanding issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic pose a complex barrier to those working mothers looking to either start or grow their businesses. It also poses a difficult question for policymakers on what the best solutions are to remove these barriers. The poll was conducted online between April 19-29, 2022, among a national sample of 2,500 mothers in the workforce, including 969 working mothers who wanted to start their own business and 425 who own a business. Working mothers are those who are currently employed women with children.",

With an estimated 60% of the workforce at least partially working from home, reliable broadband Internet is clearly central to most people’s professional lives (not to mention their personal lives, considering the prevalence of media streaming, video chatting and online gaming). And yet, 42 million Americans lack access to reliable high-speed Internet, either because of its availability or cost. (Some among them may not want broadband, but many likely do and lack a good option.) As such, the 2021 Infrastructure Bill allocates an unprecedented $65 billion to help close the digital divide. There are many questions about how this money should best be spent, how to avoid waste and duplication, and defining new standards for what we even consider “broadband” to be. But to begin, this post provides an overview of the current state of broadband in the Infrastructure Bill and the biggest current issues. This will serve as the baseline from which future blog posts and projects can dive more deeply. A Focus on Rural, Underserved Areas As our technology team has previously covered, there are several reasons that the digital divide persists even within dense urban cities where broadband infrastructure is available, including cost and lack of consumer familiarity with computer and Internet systems. The good news is that a good portion of the Infrastructure Bill’s $65 billion is allocated towards subsidizing the costs of Internet subscriptions and training people and communities on using the Internet. But bringing high-speed Internet access to where it does not currently exist has proven to be more of a challenge. This post covers some of the key priorities of the Infrastructure Bill, as well as different potential solutions to bringing the Internet to every corner of the country. The Infrastructure Bill Further developing the broadband relief packages passed as part of the Covid Relief package, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law on November 15, 2021. It provides a substantial amount of investment into different categories of broadband buildout, including: $1 billion for middle mile networks, defined as “a dedicated line that transmits a signal to and from an internet point of presence” $600 million to enable states to issue private activity bonds to finance broadband deployment in rural areas where a majority of households do not have broadband access $2 billion in additional support for rural areas through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including the ReConnect program that provides loans, grants and loan/grant combinations to fund broadband deployments $2 billion for the Tribal Broadband Connectivity program, which was established in the December 2020 COVID-19 relief package and is administered by the NTIA $14.2 billion for an Affordability Connectivity Benefit to provide a $30 per month voucher for low-income families to use toward an Internet service plan of their choosing Where and How to Spend the Money The primary locations for buildout are centered in areas that do not currently&hellip;",

    "content": "This blog was originally published on October 27, 2022 and updated on April 8, 2025 The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is the largest and most effective federal program to encourage the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental homes. Instead of relying on the federal appropriations process, the LIHTC provides financing support for affordable housing through tax expenditures. The program competitively awards tax credits to offset construction costs in exchange for reserving a significant number of rent-restricted units for low-income households. Three major benefits of the LIHTC: 1. The LIHTC increases the supply of affordable housing &nbsp; See a map showing the number of LIHTC units by state. 2. The LIHTC generates jobs and economic activity 3. The LIHTC revitalizes low-income communities Encouraging private investment in entry-level housing in distressed communities Unfortunately, no similar tax credit exists for affordable owner-occupied housing—the LIHTC’s myriad benefits are glaringly absent from the owner-occupied market, since LIHTC financing only applies to rental units. The severe shortage of entry-level housing prevents many low- and middle-income families from achieving homeownership—the primary wealth-building tool in America. However, bipartisan members of Congress have introduced the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act to create a tax credit program to finance the building and renovating of owner-occupied homes in distressed neighborhoods. As with affordable rental housing, the gap between the cost of construction and the sales price is a major barrier impeding increases in the supply of entry-level housing. The Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit (NHTC) would encourage much-needed investment to overcome the hurdle of high construction costs. Strengthening the LIHTC and establishing the NHTC would significantly increase the supply of affordable homes and address the supply shortage The lack of affordable housing is a primary driver of high housing prices. The Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act—which would increase LIHTC allocations among other changes to the program—and the NHTC would jointly financed over 2 million affordable homes over the course of a decade. Paired together, a more robust LIHTC and a new NHTC would meaningfully ameliorate the shortage of affordable housing and target a major source of the inflation experienced consumers. A healthy affordable housing supply could also ease the burden of future inflation spells for families. Since housing is the single greatest monthly cost for most families, an abundant supply of affordable housing that can meet spikes in demand is important to ensure housing prices remain stable in the face of rising costs of living for families due to inflation.",

Children missed out on key socialization and early learning opportunities, and parents were under additional stress due to grief, job losses, and the constant risk of infection. With many parents pulling their children out of child care, the sector faced the possibility of collapse. I (Maya Jasinska) spent the spring of 2022 teaching kindergarten in an independent, K-8 school in New York City. Even among children from high socioeconomic backgrounds, who had additional resources and supports at their disposal, my co-teacher and I saw unprecedented levels of anxiety among our students. There were students in my class who had never attended school before and, if they were only children, had little –to no socialization and play experience with other children their age. Kindergarten, which has become increasingly academic in the U.S., needed to first and foremost be a place to practice social interactions and basic executive function skills. Even with gentler expectations, one child who had psychosomatic stomachaches almost every day told us she got them when she “was scared she wouldn’t be able to hold all the learning in her brain.” On top of academic anxieties, children were struggling with the same worries over illness and the pandemic that adults were. One child would have a panic attack at lunchtime every day because she was scared to take her mask off to eat. On the day the school’s mask mandate loosened, another child told me he had not slept all night because he had nightmares about what it would be like to not wear a mask—these children had never not worn masks in school and had no frame of reference for what interacting socially without a mask was like. Classmates who got infected would be missing for days at a time and children worried about their friends and about if they might get sick next. As teachers, we needed to double our efforts to preserve a sense of community in the classroom and make it feel like a safe space for growing and learning. At the same time, the pandemic took a severe emotional toll on child care workers. The child care workforce has always struggled with higher –than average rates of depression and stress due to low pay, frequent staff shortages, and strenuous work, and these rates only worsened during the pandemic. Teaching is hard work: emotionally, intellectually, physically. Early childhood educators don’t have the option of remote work. Child care centers needed to stay open to enable other essential worker parents to go to work. Child care workers were under the additional stresses of risking contracting COVID themselves or bringing it home to family members who may be at higher risk. A recent Yale research study, currently under peer review, reports that 66.5% of child care providers are currently experiencing moderate to high levels of stress and 45.7% of child care professionals are screening positive for depression.

    "content": "Access to capital is a perennial challenge for entrepreneurs and small business owners. To encourage lenders to make loans to small businesses that have not otherwise been able to secure financing on reasonable terms and conditions, the Small Business Administration (SBA) provides support through several loan guarantees. The 7(a) loan guaranty program is the SBA’s flagship lending support program. In fiscal year 2022, the SBA approved 47,677 (7a) loans, totaling $25.6 billion. During National Women&#8217;s Small Business Month, we look at the 7(a) lending landscape for women-owned small businesses. Women-Owned Small Businesses Receive Small Share of 7(a) Loans Men own 63% of small employer businesses in the United States yet win a greater share of 7(a) loans. For the past decade, women-owned small businesses have won about 30% of 7(a) loans annually. Small Businesses with a Majority of Female Owners Are Getting More Loans There has, however, been some divergence in 7(a) approvals for small businesses owned by women. Those that are majority female-owned have seen their share of 7(a) loans rise from 16% in fiscal year 2012 to 20 in fiscal year 2022. This is roughly in line with the overall female share of small employer firms. Women-Owned Small Businesses Get Fewer 7(a) Loan Dollars Not only do women-owned small businesses receive fewer 7(a) loans, but the value of those loans is also significantly less than their male counterparts receive. In fiscal year 2022, the value of 7(a) loans received by male-owned small businesses was more than twice the value of loans supporting women-owned small businesses. The average 7(a) loan size is also smaller for women-owned small businesses. In fiscal year 2022, women-owned small businesses received nearly $100,000 less, on average, than businesses owned by men. &nbsp;",

    "content": "The federal government is a huge buyer of goods and services. Each year, about 1 out of every 10 dollars in federal spending goes to contractors, who provide the government with everything from office supplies to fighter jets. By law, 23% of that spending must go to small businesses. Small business participation in the procurement process supports important public outcomes, like job creation and a robust industrial base. It also benefits small businesses, who earn new sources of revenue. Yet getting involved in government contracting is an extremely difficult process for small business owners, who frequently say the procurement system is broken and that there is a lack of accountability from agencies and intermediaries. These and other challenges have resulted in women-owned small businesses earning fewer contracts than would be expected and years of unmet procurement goals. Women-owned small businesses are underrepresented in federal contracting Women own about 20% of small employer businesses in the United States, yet the federal government’s goal for women-owned small business procurement is just 5%. According to a Bipartisan Policy Center report, the federal government has only met this small goal twice—in 2015 (5.05%) and 2019 (5.19%)—since it was established in 1994. The share of contracts that went to women-owned small businesses even declined from FY20 (4.85%) to FY21 (4.63%). Years the WOSB Goal Was Unmet in the Past Decade Double counting confuses the picture and makes things look better than they are While the federal government fell short of the 5% WOSB government-wide contracting goal again in FY21, 75% of agencies (18 out of 24) met the WOSB goal. How is this possible? The Department of Defense (DoD) is the government’s largest purchaser of contracted goods and services, accounting for more than half of all federal procurement dollars spent annually. When DoD falls short of contracting goals, it is difficult for the government-wide goals to be met. Another contributing factor is that procurement data is muddled by double counting—a practice that allows agencies to count a contract it awards to multiple contracting goals. That means that when an agency awards a contract to a business owned by a Black woman, for example, it gets to count that contract toward two subcategory goals: the small disadvantaged business goal and the women-owned small business goal. As highlighted in a recent Bipartisan Policy Center report, $27.1 billion in federal contracts were counted toward the WOSB goal in FY20. Without double counting, that total falls to $26.4 billion. That’s half a billion dollars in small business contracts—a substantial difference for small businesses that could be on the receiving end of those contracts. A declining number of small businesses, including WOSBs, participate in federal procurement. In FY21, 83% of agencies awarded fewer prime contracts to women-owned small businesses than they did the year before—contributing to a 6.8% decline in government-wide contracts awarded to small businesses owned by women. This is further evidence of the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of small business contractors. As outlined in a Bipartisan&hellip;",

    "content": "This fall, the White House turned its attention to nutrition, hosting the first Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years. In the months leading up to the gathering, listening sessions were held across the country to gain insights from stakeholders; BPC hosted one such listening session in July to help guide the White House’s strategy. The September conference brought together a broad range of stakeholders including lawmakers, advocates, thought leaders, industry experts, and individuals with lived experience. Unfortunately, bipartisanship was limited. But the policies presented at the conference leave space for leaders on both sides to join the conversation. Ahead of the conference, the Biden-Harris administration released the National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health which outlined their priorities regarding hunger and diet-related diseases. The five-pillar strategy includes improving food access and affordability; integrating nutrition and health; empowering all consumers to make and have access to healthy choices; supporting physical activity for all; and enhancing nutrition and food security research. The administration recommends policies in each pillar aimed at various federal agencies with authority over parts of the health and nutrition sector. Further, a “call-to-action” for a whole of society response involving state, local, and tribal governments as well as non-government stakeholders was advanced. For the last decade, the Bipartisan Policy Center has championed many of the ideas presented during the White House Conference. In May 2021, BPC focused its efforts on ways to improve food security and nutrition through national policy with the creation of the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force. Since its creation, the bipartisan task force, chaired by former Agriculture Secretaries Ann M. Veneman and Dan Glickman, Leslie Sarasin of FMI-The Food Industry Association, and José Andrés of World Central Kitchen, has released two policy briefs, Improving Food and Nutrition Security During COVID-19, the Economic Recovery, and Beyond and Strengthening the Child Nutrition Programs, that contain bipartisan policies agreed to by all task force members, The overlap in policies between the administration’s National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health and recent BPC policy briefs are significant. Specifically, the White House echoed BPC’S recommendations for expansions to key programs including the Summer EBT, senior nutrition programs, and emergency food assistance programs. BPC and the administration also align on the policy recommendation to increase Medicare coverage for Medical Nutrition Therapy, defined by the CDC as “nutrition-based treatment provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist.” Medical Nutrition Therapy is currently only covered in Medicare for people with diabetes and kidney disease despite benefits for an array of diet-related conditions. BPC’s 2022 policy brief Expanding Access to Obesity Treatments for Older Adults, and the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force’s report Improving Food and Nutrition Security During COVID-19, the Economic Recovery, and Beyond, spell out the need for expanding Medical Nutrition Therapy and behavioral interventions to aid in weight loss and management of diet-related diseases.

    "content": "On June 10, 2022, the White House announced the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, a hemispheric agreement with sign on from 21 governments throughout the Americas that aims to create conditions for safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration and strengthen frameworks for international protection and cooperation. The declaration was met with praise from international agencies and policymakers, though some expressed concern about follow-through on its implementation. New dynamics and trends in Western Hemisphere migration, demonstrated most clearly at the U.S.-Mexico border, have added urgency to the White House’s implementation of the agreement, with the White House holding a meeting on September 26, 2022, dedicated to the implementation of the declaration. Nineteen countries, all signatories to the declaration, met to reaffirm their commitment to implementation, put in place a plan for implementation, and appoint special coordinators for each country. In this blog, we delve into the reasons behind this declaration, details of the declaration, and how it measures up to expectations. Why now? There has been a shift in demographics at the border in the last few years, specifically a rise in the “other” category of migrants—migrants from countries other than Mexico or the northern triangle of Central America—which have comprised a large majority of encounters for most of the last decade. The category notably includes migrants from South America, the Caribbean, and from other continents. With this shift comes an increasing recognition by the Biden administration and other world leaders that a hemispheric approach to migration is necessary. Migration at the U.S. southern border has diversified with higher numbers of migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela especially (with Haitian migrants accounting for another increasingly large flow). Venezuela’s collapse has strained neighboring countries in the region since 2014, when the exodus of Venezuelans began in earnest. As of August 2022, about 6.8 million Venezuelans have left the country. Colombia hosts the most Venezuelans (2.4 million), and the majority have settled in other Latin American and Caribbean countries. Figure 1: Venezuelans Encountered at the Border by U.S. Border Patrol (FY21-FY22TD) Source: (1) Encounters of Venezuelans at the U.S.-Mexico border began increasing steadily starting in March 2021, peaking at nearly 25,000 encounters in December 2021, as seen in Figure 1 above. Mexico imposed a visa restriction on Venezuelans in January, prohibiting Venezuelans from flying to Mexico as tourists. Encounter numbers at the border dropped steeply in February 2022 after the visa requirement was implemented, but rose sharply again in June 2022 and have risen steadily since, until August 2022, when more than 25,000 Venezuelans were encountered at the border again. Reports have indicated that Venezuelans are now making more dangerous journeys to the border, with huge increases in the number of Venezuelans traveling through the Darien Gap and Panama and arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border by land. The Biden administration announced on October 12 that it would admit 24,000 Venezuelans with pre-existing ties to the United States via a parole program through ports of entry, granting them a narrow legal&hellip;",

Ben Sasse (R-NE). Campus Happenings Freedom of Expression and Expressive Conduct American University | September 19, 2022 On August 29, American University adopted a new policy on free expression, including free expression in the classroom, invited speakers, and counter-speech and protest. This follows the AU Faculty Senate’s adoption of a new Statement of Values on Free Expression in May. University of Idaho Gives Employees New Guidance on Abortion Becca Savransky | Idaho Statesman | September 27, 2022 In the wake of new state legislation disallowing public funds to provide, counsel in favor of, or promote abortion, the University of Idaho issued a memo cautioning that enforcement of these laws “remains unclear” and “warned employees against promoting abortion or services for the ‘prevention of conception’ and recommended limits on discussions of abortion in the classroom.” The AFA, FIRE, and AAUP sent letters responding to the memo. UCLA Administrators Monitor Students’ Social Media Activity Victoria Li and Phoebe Brous | Daily Bruin | October 9, 2022 After being named in a Dallas Morning News investigation as one of several dozen campuses hiring a vendor to monitor students’ social media accounts, UCLA acknowledged it used the service. A campus spokesperson said that the service is “not used to proactively monitor any social media account” and has used the service to identify and support students at risk of harming themselves or others. A research fellow and graduate student are quoted, expressing concerns that monitoring social media chills expression and discourages campus protests. ‘He Won’t Live a Day in Peace’: UF Presidential Finalist Ben Sasse Cut Off By Protesters Flooding Q&amp;A Alligator Staff | The Independent Florida Alligator | October 10, 2022 About 300 student protestors used the heckler’s veto at a student forum, where the student body president was moderating a Q&amp;A session with University of Florida presidential finalist Sen. Sasse. Demonstrators cited Sen. Sasse’s positions on abortion, gay marriage, and student debt relief and what they saw as a lack of transparency during the presidential search process. MUSG, BSC, LASO Leaders Removed From Offices Julia Abuzzahab and Megan Woolard | Marquette Wire | October 11, 2022 After leading a demonstration calling “for more support for students of color” at Marquette University’s 2022 New Student Convocation, leaders of the Marquette University Student Government, Black Student Council, and Latin American Student Organization faced disciplinary hearings and dismissal from their leadership positions. The campus response has been mixed, with some calling for the student leaders to be reinstated and others expressing their disapproval of the students’ disruption.

    "content": "A significant Big Tech overhaul is high on the Republican agenda for 2023. As the midterm elections loom, House Republicans are rolling out their “Commitment to America” agenda that is a four-part blueprint for the GOP’s policy vision and legislative agenda for the new Congress should they take back the majority. Republicans have had eyes on Section 230 reform for years claiming social media companies overly flag, deplatform, and discriminate against conservative viewpoints— what former President Trump claimed was “selective censorship.” As Republicans plan to take back the House, let’s look at how their forthcoming agenda compares to the Biden Administration’s tech regulation goals and if there is overlap for bipartisan compromise in 2023. Understanding the Section 230 Debate The overall debate surrounding Section 230 is embedded with interconnected issues of social media liability, free expression, and content moderation. Section 230 is part of the federal 1996 Communications Decency Act that states, &#8220;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider&#8221; (47 U.S.C. § 230). Simply put, Section 230 says social media platforms cannot be held legally responsible for the content users post. More than 25 years after its enactment, legislators argue it’s time to reexamine and revise those protections for the tech industry, which has found itself in a string of controversies involving privacy concerns, antitrust investigations, the radicalization of extremists, accusations of liberal bias, and the societal consequences of digital harm on children. Indeed, over the last few years, the CEOs of a handful of tech companies have testified repeatedly in congressional hearings. For example, recently, the Senate Homeland Security Committee held a hearing on Social Media’s Impact on Homeland Security where lawmakers across the aisle pressed top executives from Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok about safety, privacy, and moderation concerns. It’s clear that Congress wants to reign in “Big Tech.” Although Section 230 has come under fire from both sides of the aisle, the issue is divided along party lines between pro-moderation versus anti-censorship arguments. Democratic lawmakers argue that Section 230 encourages the spread of harmful content while technology companies deflect accountability. On the other side, Republican lawmakers say that Section 230 allows these companies to violate free speech by unfairly censoring conservative viewpoints such as deplatforming a sitting Republican President. Nevertheless, for all the talk about repealing or amending Section 230, legislation affecting social media platforms has proved very difficult to pass. The tech industry advocates the continuing importance of the law arguing that Section 230 facilitates innovation and allows companies to compete. Industry experts are concerned that increased regulation could have unintended or harmful tradeoffs involving privacy protections, cybersecurity risks, First Amendment rights, or stifling American tech entrepreneurship. On October 3, 2022, the Supreme Court announced that it will hear for the first time two cases involving Section 230 and content moderation. The Supreme Court has never interpreted the limitations and exceptions of the law; however, Justice Clarence&hellip;",

    "content": "Proposed interventions for the college affordability crisis tend to be as complicated as the issue itself. College prices are generally set by institutions with little oversight, though at community colleges and public universities in some states, tuition may be set by entities directly or indirectly answerable to voters. The price of college varies from institution to institution and from student to student—from students paying out of pocket or taking big student loans at pricy private colleges to public community colleges where some students pay zero tuition thanks to state legislative intervention. The federal government’s role in paying for college has largely been to provide student aid that “follows the student” and can be spent at most institutions: Pell Grants for low-income students, federal student loans, and aid to military personnel and veterans. The federal government has also been a funder of last resort during economic crises, providing emergency aid to states and colleges to alleviate the impacts of the Great Recession and the COVID pandemic on higher education systems. The federal government should take a more direct role in bringing down the cost of college for students by providing flexible block grants to states—with strings attached. To incentivize states to invest in college affordability, the federal government would provide a large infusion of federal matching grants, which would partially be used to bring down the price of college as the state sees fit: through student grants, direct funding of public institutions (to bring down tuition and other costs), or through College Promise programs. This funding stream would also go towards the creation of “rainy day funds,” which can provide a buffer for state higher education spending in the event of future economic recessions, thereby avoiding the need for large infusions of federal emergency spending. What is a rainy day fund? BPC has advocated for using some of this new funding to stabilize state investment in higher education during recessions by creating rainy day funds that states could draw on when their budgets take a hit. This would help prevent the tuition hikes that have occurred during prior recessions as well as avert long-term state disinvestment in higher education. The strings attached to these new flexible block grants to states would include maintenance of effort provisions to ensure that states increased their investment in college affordability rather than simply moving money around. Limitations on how and when states could draw on the rainy day funds would also be necessary in order to ensure that a rainy day fund for higher education was not used as a slush fund to fill other budget gaps. How much money would need to be invested in state rainy day funds? In previous recessions, state higher education spending has taken notable hits, with spending dips of 15-25% being typical. As such, to meaningfully compensate for such drops, the size of a state rainy day fund would need to be comparable. Using 15% of recent annual state spending on higher education as an estimate, covering a possible&hellip;",

    "content": "After unanimous approval by the California Legislature, Gov. Newsom recently signed into law AB 2273- California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, requiring businesses providing online services for children under 18 to enhance privacy protections. This comes after months of deliberation in Congress on two bills similarly targeting children’s online privacy. Taking effect in 2024, the new law requires businesses to take extra precautions if a website is likely accessed by children. It requires businesses to perform data protection impact assessments to help assess potential risks and prohibits the unnecessary collecting, selling, or sharing of children’s personal information. As the first mover on the issue, the law coming out of Sacramento will likely set the tone for future efforts to protect children’s privacy and safety online. California Effect Many California businesses will likely satisfy these additional restrictions and requirements due to the stringency of the law, but whether this will influence businesses operating outside California or other state legislatures to embrace these measures, and to what extent, is uncertain. The influence of California’s laws beyond its own state borders has historical precedent, most notably exemplified in California’s regulation of car emission standards in the 1970s. When California adopted stricter rules than the national Clean Air Act standard, about a dozen states adopted California’s measures, as did automobile manufacturers throughout the entire country. Furthermore, when the European Union considered its own standards, German car manufacturers who had already complied with California advocated for higher standards to retain a competitive advantage. A phenomenon known as the “California Effect,” coined by University of California at Berkeley professor David Vogel, explains why standards introduced in California often become the standard across U.S. states. Similar to the “Brussels Effect,” the California Effect happens when businesses choose to offer products within the confines of the most stringent regulation, rather than adapting their products for different markets. It can be simpler and more cost-effective for a business to ‘up-regulate,’ depending on the type of product sold. This effect can also occur if other jurisdictions adopt similar rules and regulations, legally requiring businesses to comply with California’s standards outside the state’s borders. The California Effect transpires in the digital space. It is easier to customize a website for users in different geographic regions than an assembly line for car parts, but it is still advantageous to create one standardized set of practices for consistency of internal business practices, cost effectiveness, and public trust and reliability. This is demonstrated through security breach notification laws: California was the first state to enact a data breach notification law in 2002, requiring entities to notify consumers exposed to a security breach. This led to an emergence of numerous state and federal bills, and by January 2012, 46 states and the District of Columbia enacted laws modeled after California’s. Researchers continue to consider whether and to what extent a California Effect takes place today or will persist in the privacy issues. Even when states deviate, California spotlights the issue and anchors the conversation. In 2018,&hellip;",

    "content": "The 45S Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave has the potential to greatly expand access to paid leave in the United States. Enacted in 2017 under the leadership of Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE), the bipartisan 45S tax credit is the first-ever federal policy to support paid family and medical leave in the United States. Surveys suggest that helping employers provide leave benefits is highly popular among Americans. According to a recent BPC report, over three-quarters (77%) of small business owners support financial incentives for small businesses that provide paid family leave benefits. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found the vast majority of Americans would prefer to receive paid family and medical leave benefits from their employer rather than the government. Additionally, Pew found that “providing tax credits to any employer that provides paid leave” is the most popular paid leave policy solution, with 87% of Americans favoring it. The following is a menu of options to enhance the 45S tax credit to increase take-up by employers and thereby expand employee access to paid family and medical leave. Evaluation and Marketing Increase awareness among small businesses. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) could partner with the Departments of Treasury and Labor to market the 45S tax credit to small businesses to increase awareness. Marketing should focus on disseminating educational materials to employers of all sizes and workers as well as helping employers understand which employees are eligible for coverage and how to request reimbursement from the IRS. Commission a study on the tax credit’s impact. Congress should authorize funds for SBA, Government Accountability Office, Department of Labor, or another government research agency to analyze the impact of the tax credit on businesses, workers, and families. Such an analysis would greatly assist policymakers as they continue to improve the law’s effectiveness. Core Enhancements and Expansions Make the tax credit permanent. The tax credit was initially enacted as a two-year pilot program, received a one-year extension, and then was subsequently authorized through 2025. The continuing uncertainty about the tax credit’s future may make businesses less likely to use it to introduce or expand paid leave benefits. Employers need to be confident that they will not have to scale back or eliminate the benefit should the tax credit expire. Increase the tax credit. Currently, the tax credit ranges from 12.5% to 25% of the cost of paid family and medical leave benefits, depending on the generosity of those benefits. To increase the incentive for employers, the credit could cover from 25% to 50% of benefit costs. Increase the tax credit for small employers. Although the tax credit is offered to businesses of all sizes, larger businesses offer paid family and medical leave policies more often than smaller businesses. A larger credit for small employers – such as those with fewer than 50 employees – could incentivize them to utilize the credit more frequently. Make the cost of obtaining temporary disability, parental leave, and/or family caregiving leave through private insurance eligible for&hellip;",

    "content": "The significance of the September inflation numbers released this morning extends beyond confirming the continued hit to Americans’ wallets—these numbers also provide the final data point for the Social Security Administration’s cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for next year’s benefits. Beginning in January 2023, monthly Social Security benefits for individuals on the program will increase by 8.7%, providing current beneficiaries welcome respite from ongoing price increases but also potentially hastening the impending depletion of Social Security’s primary trust fund. Experts, elected officials, and stakeholders have understood the extent of this problem for decades, but typical partisan lines in the sand and fear of political consequences have stymied action. Today’s COLA announcement serves as yet another reminder that policymakers must take swift action to shore up Social Security; they simply cannot afford to delay any longer. The 2022 Social Security Trustees Report released in June (which assumed this COLA would be 3.8%) estimated that the program’s Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund will run dry in 2034, at which point all beneficiaries will face an immediate 23% benefit cut to bring payments in line with program income (mainly payroll taxes). The difference between scheduled benefits and funded benefits will continue to grow for decades as the population over the age of 65 reaches unprecedented levels. Far from a minor inconvenience, this cut will devastate many retirees, especially the roughly 20% of Americans aged 65 or older who rely on Social Security benefits for over 75% of their income. Figure 1: Trust Fund Income and Expenditures as Percentages of Taxable Payroll Source: 2022 Social Security Trustees Report Policymakers have known for many years that Social Security would become insolvent in the 2030s, and their lack of action has served only to magnify the adjustments needed to get the program on a sustainable path. Consider that in 2012, a payroll tax rate increase of 2.61 percentage points (to 15.01%) or an across-the-board benefit cut of 16.2% would have ensured the Social Security trust funds’ solvency for the full 75-year period considered by the trustees—but the benefit formula has not changed, and the payroll tax rate remains the same 12.40% as it was in 2012. Today, shoring up the trust funds would require a tax increase of 3.24 percentage points (to 15.64%) or a benefit cut of 20.3%, and failing to act until the trust funds run dry in 2035 would necessitate a tax increase of 4.07 percentage points (to 16.47%) or a benefit cut of 24.9%. Figure 2: The Tax Increase or Benefit Cut Required to Prevent Trust Fund Depletion Keeps Increasing Ensuring the long-term sustainability of Social Security is a thorny challenge that will require a nuanced, thoughtful, and comprehensive package of reforms, but two reasons for cautious optimism provide a brighter-than-expected outlook for lawmakers: Enhancing Social Security benefits—particularly for those who most rely on them in retirement—and putting the program on a fiscally sustainable path are not mutually exclusive.

To maximize the impact of new resources, agencies will have to make strategic, cost-effective investments—which will mean working with the private sector for some projects. One key way for agencies to achieve cost-efficiency and manage risk—while leveraging private sector expertise and innovation—is to engage in public-private partnerships (P3s). Public-Private Partnership: A long-term contract between a government agency and the private sector where the private entity assumes responsibilities such as the design, building, financing, operation, and maintenance of a project. In the past year, transportation agencies in New York City and Washington D.C. made major announcements about their first-ever P3s. Successful delivery of these projects could inspire further P3s, as agencies with ambitious capital programs look for innovative strategies to improve the delivery of challenging projects. The MTA’s Accessibility Project New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the largest transit agency in the U.S., oversees subway, rail, and bus service along with some bridges and tunnels in the NYC region. Improving accessibility is a major priority for the agency—as only 27% of it 472 subway stations have the elevators or ramps necessary to be fully wheelchair accessible. As part of its accessibility initiative, the MTA announced in late 2021 that it would pursue a P3 for the design, construction, financing, and maintenance of a series of accessibility improvements. Specifically, the project involves installing and rehabilitating elevators at 13 stations, making 8 stations newly accessible and upgrading 5 stations. The proposed P3 would require the private sector partner to complete the installation and rehabs of the elevators and maintain them for 15 years. The private partner would receive progress and milestone payments during construction followed by completion and availability payments to cover capital and maintenance costs. The MTA released a request for qualifications in January 2022 and, after completing an evaluation of the experience and previous performance of applicants, developed a short list of potential private partners invited to submit proposals by October 31, 2022. In its request for proposals, the agency stated that it decided to use the P3 model to “achieve timely completion of the ADA improvements and ensure reliable ongoing maintenance services and value for money over the term of the Project Agreement.” Along those lines, Jamie Torres-Springer, the President of MTA Construction and Development, said at a recent P3 conference that the agency asked three questions evaluating whether a P3 was a good option for the agency: Can we find a package of projects where we can share risk? Can we pin performance and reliability on the partner? Can we lower costs? The MTA recently reorganized, centralizing construction from each of its subagencies into one agency-wide construction department. Now a one-stop shop that can provide more consistent expectations, this change could make it easier for private entities to partner with the agency on P3 projects. DDOT’s Smart Streetlight&hellip;",

    "content": "Women play a key role in the American small business landscape, owning 1.2 million small employer firms employing 9.2 million people, with total payroll above $350 billion. To mark National Women’s Small Business Month, observed this month, here are five facts about women-owned small businesses. 1. Women are nearly half of the U.S. labor force—but one-fifth of small business owners. Women account for 47% of the U.S. labor force.2 Their share of small business owners is less than half that: women own 21.7% of small businesses, those employer firms with fewer than 500 employees. 2. Women-owned small businesses tend to be smaller in terms of employment. Compared to small businesses owned by men and those owned equally by men and women, women-owned small businesses, on average, employ fewer people per firm. Most small businesses in the United States are very small, irrespective of ownership. While 92% of women-owned small businesses have fewer than 20 employees, the share is similar for men: 89% of male-owned small businesses have fewer than 20 employees. 3. Women-owned businesses tend to be younger than those owned by men. Six in 10 women-owned employer firms have been in operation for less than 10 years. That is higher than the same share for male-owned and equally male/female-owned firms. White men own the oldest business: 49% of white male-owned firms are older than 10 years. Black and Asian women have the youngest businesses: 69% and 70%, respectively, of businesses they own are younger than 10 years old. 4. There is diversity among women-owned businesses in sales, employment, and payroll. Performance among women-owned businesses varies by the race and ethnicity of owners. Women tend to own smaller firms: the highest share of women’s business ownership is among the smallest firms (those with one to four employees), at 23%. By contrast, women own just 13% of the largest small businesses, those with 250 to 499 employees. There are, however, over 9,000 women-owned small businesses with between 100 and 499 employees. Those companies have over $31 million in sales per firm, 184 employees per firm, and $7.8 million in payroll per firm, on average. 5. Women expressed more pessimism coming out of the pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects still haunting small businesses in 2021, women small business owners were slightly more pessimistic about the near-term future of their business. Sixty-three percent of women business owners said they were somewhat or very concerned about the financial health of their businesses, compared to 59% of male business owners.",

    "content": "Today’s college students are the most diverse in history. Schools are seeking to ensure students of all social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds feel accepted on campus. One way has been by making formal commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) using mechanisms such as statements, trainings, and surveys. In fact, the majority of American universities are now integrating diversity and inclusion commitments into their university missions. These policies are being placed alongside schools’ long-standing commitments to academic freedom and free expression. Academic freedom protects professors from “professional disadvantage” in intramural speech when expressing controversial views in their approaches to research, classroom management, and curricula design as well as their freedom from “institutional censorship or discipline” in extramural speech. Often, schools have made commitments to DEI without clarifying how these newer policies will harmonize with other commitments, including academic freedom. Recent campus controversies over whether a school’s commitment to DEI supersedes academic freedom or vice versa suggest there is great confusion over how—or even whether—these policies are compatible. For instance, Georgetown’s process of adjudicating a tweet by Georgetown University Law Center’s incoming administrator Ilya Shapiro and deciding whether his actions should be governed by the school’s DEI or academic freedom commitment revealed the potential conflict between DEI and academic freedom. Some Georgetown faculty argued that Shapiro should be fired because his statements violated the university’s DEI principles. Other faculty, along with free speech advocates, believed that sanctioning Shapiro for “ideological reasons” would be inconsistent with Georgetown’s free speech policy. Shapiro’s case revealed faculty, administrators, and students do not have clear guidance from the university regarding these policies. Keith Whittington, the Academic Freedom Alliance’s Academic Committee chair and William Nelson Cromwell professor of politics at Princeton University, argues that the perceived tension between a university’s academic freedom and diversity commitments arises from a misunderstanding of what these values require. They can go hand in hand, Whittington argues, because “inclusivity necessitates the tolerance of a diversity of ideas, as well as a diversity of people, and the empowerment of a broad range of students and faculty to give voice to their ideas.” Nancy Thomas, director of the Institute for Democracy &amp; Higher Education at Tufts University, points out that university administrators often perceive a need to choose between prioritizing free speech or DEI. However, Thomas argues, this “zero-sum” absolutist perception is “an unnecessary and ill-advised choice.” Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, lays out the challenge universities face: “Universities today are trying to ensure freedom of expression while at the same time cultivating recognition and belonging. This effort&#8230;has to do not only with admissions, but also with every facet of the school’s culture and climate: from how one values and retains faculty and staff to how people are treated in classrooms, lunchrooms, and board rooms.” Since faculty are integral to upholding both academic freedom and DEI commitments, universities must be deliberate about how to uphold faculty’s academic freedom rights while also equipping faculty with the necessary tools to further the university’s DEI&hellip;",

    "content": "Data privacy has proven to be one of the more difficult policy issues to oversee and legislate. Not only is there a privacy paradox in which consumers state they care about privacy but do not change their behavior to match, but they often lack insight into the personal data that technology companies have and what they do with it. This is especially telling with data that mobile telecommunications companies generate from cell phones, because they need to know their users’ locations (at the very least) for their services to work properly. With the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Health Center, there has been increased concern that women’s healthcare activities could be discerned from their location data. Federal policymakers are tackling these issues from multiple angles. The FTC has pledged to double down on preventing the illegal sharing of sensitive health data generated by mobile devices. This follows its longstanding governance of information privacy, which it has enforced throughout the years by suing Facebook over some of its practices, creating privacy labels for app developers, and most recently, filing an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to “crack down on harmful commercial surveillance and lax data security” with health care data. However, as this data is shared through the Internet, the FCC, which generally oversees the telecommunications industry, also has jurisdiction in this space. Telecommunications companies have also been known to commercialize consumer mobile phone data, and in 2018 security researchers found that several of them were disclosing consumer location data to third parties that weren’t authorized to receive it. (Specifically, A-GPS data that is typically used for emergencies.) In 2020, the FCC proposed fining them over this, but ultimately did not. While government agencies determine whether and how to regulate use of data by private entities, these agencies have also faced criticism around their own access to consumer data. For instance, the US Department of Homeland Security purchased vast troves of location data on US citizens without a warrant. The FTC’s recommitment to cracking down on illegal health data sharing was likely the impetus for the FCC to send an inquiry to major wireless providers regarding the collection, storage, and processing of customers’ geolocation data. (However, the FCC has never explicitly mentioned women’s health as the reason for this inquiry.) These included large companies like Verizon and Comcast, virtual network operators like Mint Mobile, and even telehealth providers like Best Buy Health. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel stated in her letters that the FTC found that mobile ISPs collected more data than was necessary to provide service and more than consumers expected. On August 25, the FCC shared the companies’ responses. The carriers collect information about the closest cell tower, latitude and longitude, cell IDs/IP addresses, etc. They do so in the name of business models (e.g., advertising), providing services through unique apps and managing their network. These companies retain data from as little as 90 days to as long as 5 years. When asked how they protect this data,&hellip;",

Half of respondents (54%) said they have experienced an increase in their rent, mortgage, or utility payments over the past 12 months—with urban respondents (60%) and renters (65%) more likely to report an increase in their housing expenses. Lower-income respondents (those making less than $50k/year) were more likely than middle and higher-income respondents to report difficulty in paying their monthly rent (50%) and utility payments (49%) over the past 12 months. One in six renters are not caught up on their rent payments (16%) and are not confident (17%) in their ability to pay their next rent payment on time. 21% of Black respondents and 18% of Hispanic respondents are not caught up on their rent payments compared to 14% of white respondents. Millennial (21%) and GenZ (22%) respondents were also more likely than the average, and older respondents, to be behind on rent. A majority of adults, across income levels and racial groups, with a mortgage reported being caught up on their mortgage payments (90%) and being confident in being able to pay their next mortgage payment on time (93%). Homelessness and high housing costs that contribute to inflation were top concerns for households—and important issues for the federal government to address. A majority of adults said growing homelessness (83%) and high housing costs contributing to inflation (82%) were important for the federal government to address, with majorities across political affiliations: 89% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans said it was important the federal government address homelessness. 88% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans said it was important that the federal government address high housing costs that are contributing to inflation. While 35% of respondents noticed increased homelessness in their communities over the past year, that percentage jumped to 53% of respondents from the West and 46% of respondents from urban communities. On average, respondents said their household’s monthly expenses have increased 37% because of inflation. Lower-income adults (34%) were more likely than middle (26%) and higher-income (20%) adults to report a higher percentage increase in their household’s monthly expenses due to inflation. Three in five (61%) respondents said inflation had impacted their household’s spending on housing expenses—with urban adults (68%) more likely than suburban (60%) to report increases in expenses. Respondents across the political spectrum agreed that ensuring the availability of affordable housing should be a focus at all levels of government. A bipartisan majority of respondents agreed that federal, state, and local governments have a responsibility to ensure that families have safe and decent housing they can afford, with the highest percentage of respondents agreeing that state governments, in particular, are responsible (78% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans). A majority of adults (71%) believe passing bipartisan legislation to grow the supply of homes and improve housing affordability should be a priority for Congress.

    "content": "Successful entrepreneurs know that changing business environments require changes to their businesses. With the president’s signature last week on the SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022, the federal government took an important step toward continuing and enhancing, through various changes, two programs that accelerate U.S. innovation and bolster economic competitiveness. For decades, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs have fostered research and development of new technologies by U.S. small businesses. Billions of dollars flow each year from agencies like the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Energy to thousands of small businesses to pursue innovative solutions to government problems. With authorization for SBIR and STTR set to expire on September 30, 2022, Small Business Committee leaders worked in bipartisan fashion to not only reauthorize the programs, but to also improve them. Chairman Ben Cardin, Ranking Member Rand Paul, Chairwoman Nydia Velázquez, and Ranking Member Blaine Luetkemeyer, as well as Senator Joni Ernst, deserve credit for their commitment to the long-term success of these programs. Like congressional leaders, the Bipartisan Policy Center saw reauthorization as an opportunity to improve the programs and supported a number of provisions that strengthen SBIR and STTR. We are proud that several changes we supported were either included in the final agreement or reflected to a certain degree. Improved Metrics, Stronger Benchmarks Small businesses that win multiple SBIR or STTR awards presented congressional leaders with tough questions. How can the federal government know whether firms that win multiple awards are achieving desired commercialization outcomes? Are taxpayers getting a return, let alone a good one, on their investments in these small businesses? Should firms be limited to a certain number of awards? For months, these and similar questions were at the forefront of reauthorization discussions. In the end, Congress agreed to several changes that will allow policymakers and program evaluators to better assess the value and impact of SBIR and STTR awards. The reauthorization bill sets new minimum performance standards for multiple awardees, including: Small businesses that have recently won more than 50 Phase I awards must demonstrate a 50% success rate in advancing to Phase II or face limits on future awards. Small businesses that have won multiple awards will also have to demonstrate greater levels of commercial success than previously required. Firms that have won more than 50 Phase II awards in recent years must have an average of $250,000 of sales and/or investments per Phase II award, while small businesses that have recently won 100 or more Phase II awards must have an average of $450,000 of sales and/or investments per Phase II award. Patents had previously been one way in which the federal government measured the success of SBIR and STTR awards, despite research indicating that patents are a poor proxy for innovation. The reauthorization bill precludes patents from being used by small businesses to meet the new performance standards.

    "content": "In the past two years, Congress has passed multiple bills that will boost our domestic clean energy supply chain—including the Energy Act of 2020 and the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as we detailed in a previous blog post. These investments are essential. To decarbonize the economy, America needs a domestic, sustainable, and secure critical minerals supply chain. Most recently, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included important provisions to drive a clean energy supply chain—such as the mineral sourcing requirements for the 30D clean vehicle tax credit, the inclusion of critical mineral mining and processing under the 45X production tax credit for advanced manufacturing, and an extension of the existing 48C investment tax credit for advanced energy projects, which now includes production or recycling of energy conservation technologies. The Biden administration is actively evaluating how to implement these tax credits, and more guidance is expected in the months and years ahead. While much attention has been focused on the IRA’s climate provisions, less attention has been paid to the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which President Joe Biden signed into law on August 9, 2022. The CHIPS and Science Act marks the culmination of a years-long effort to bolster the domestic semiconductor industry and establish America’s leadership in the clean energy economy. The positive impact of these supply chain investments should become more apparent in the years ahead, particularly due to the strategic investments CHIPS made in workforce training. Even with these bold supply chain infrastructure investments, such as the IIJA’s $6 billion for battery manufacturing and processing capacity, the raw material reserves required service this manufacturing are still coming from abroad, especially China which now dominates the critical mineral mining and processing sector globally. Of the 50 critical minerals identified by the U.S. Geological Survey, the United States is 100% net import-reliant on 14 of them and more than 50% net import-reliant for an additional 15. The national security concerns over such extreme dependence on foreign sourcing are readily apparent. Russia accounts for just 11% of global nickel supply, yet fear of sanctions resulting from their invasion of Ukraine sent the price of nickel temporarily soaring by nearly 100% in just 10 days, causing EV manufacturers who rely on nickel for batteries to raise prices and delay shipments. To relieve these supply chain bottlenecks and reduce national security risks, the United States should assess available material reserves and prioritize investments in key steps of the production process to develop domestically (e.g. mining, processing, recycling, manufacturing, etc.), factoring in the likelihood of global supply disruptions, and rely on allied partners for the remainder of the steps. Figure 1: Net import reliance for several key critical minerals. The USGS defines net import reliance as the percentage of a mineral commodity used by the United States that must be imported from another country. An important component of onshoring mining, refining, and processing is the workforce that will fill these jobs. In the past 30 years, the U.S. mining workforce&hellip;",

    "content": "Earlier this year, BPC and Morning Consult surveyed 2,500 working mothers to better understand the varied challenges they face. The poll confirms that the burdens experienced by moms in the workforce are not shared equally. Today, single working moms face substantially more financial difficulties than their married counterparts. During the pandemic, single working moms faced considerably greater challenges balancing caregiving with making ends meet. Caregiving responsibilities force mothers to make complex decisions for their families – decisions greatly exacerbated by the pandemic. Single working moms were particularly squeezed, forced to tighten their spending and modify their career ambitions. Finding 1: Single working mothers experience heightened financial insecurity relative to married working mothers. When asked about their financial security, 55% of single mothers in the workforce report feeling less financially secure today than before the pandemic, compared to 46% of married mothers. Further, many would struggle to make ends meet if they were to go more than a week without pay. A staggering 37% of single working moms cannot go one week without pay and still meet their families&#8217; financial needs, while 70% cannot go more than one month. When we compare these responses to married mothers, the financial strains become even more apparent. Only 18% of married moms cannot go one week without pay, and 51% cannot go more than one month without pay. Moreover, nearly three times as many married (13%) as single (5%) working moms could maintain their family’s financial needs for more than six months without a paycheck. Finding 2: Due to increased caregiving demands, single mothers tightened spending more than married mothers during the pandemic. While both single and married working moms faced tough financial decisions trying to meet increased caregiving demands during the pandemic, single moms carried a larger burden. These caregiving burdens resulted in immediate financial strains among single working mothers, with 48% tapping into emergency savings compared to 43% of married mothers. Single mothers also reduced spending on everyday purchases (54%) at a higher rate than married mothers (50%). Additionally, single working mothers put future financial security on hold at slightly higher rates than married mothers: 39% delayed or decreased contributions to their retirement savings and 24% reduced payments on their student loans. Decisions like these could weigh down single mothers’ financial security for decades to come. Finding 3: Single working mothers modified their work lives due to caregiving responsibilities at consistently higher rates than married working mothers during the pandemic. Increased caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic placed strains on single mothers’ professional lives, likely compounding their financial strain even further: 39% reduced their work hours, and 27% quit a job because of caregiving responsibilities. Married working moms faced similar challenges balancing work and caregiving, but to a lesser extent: 32% reduced their work hours and 16% quit a job. When options for child care were limited, the best decision for some may have been to drop out of the workforce or reduce hours to meet increased needs at home. Their decisions to&hellip;",

    "content": "The Supreme Court has a long history of ruling on immigration issues—in fact, some of its most consequential decisions have been in immigration cases, such as the 1898 ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which established the precedent that anyone born in the United States is a citizen by birth (otherwise known as birthright citizenship, or jus soli). Until recently, the majority of cases pertaining to immigration decided by the Supreme Court were fairly obscure, and mostly aimed at practitioners and experts, and were about interpretations of specific sections of immigration law as it pertained to different individual cases, most often in deportation proceedings. These cases had major implications for the practice of immigration law, but were not typically about broad policies or programs. However, recent cases involving immigration, such as Biden v. Texas (the Texas lawsuit over the Biden Administration’s ending of the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP), have addressed broad governmental policy and executive authority. As Congress continues to avoid legislating on major immigration policy, presidents and their administrations have increasingly taken bold steps, leading to increasing litigation. This means that the federal courts have taken on a larger role in the sphere of immigration policy and beyond, including the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court on Immigration This Supreme Court term’s blockbuster case on immigration, Biden v. Texas, dealt primarily with the implementation and proposed termination of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), a government program commonly known as “Remain in Mexico,” that allowed U.S. immigration officials to send asylum seekers to Mexico to wait for their U.S. immigration court hearings. The policy was first implemented by the Trump administration in 2017. In 2021, the Biden administration’s decision to end MPP was challenged by the states of Texas and Missouri who argued that ending MPP violated federal immigration law and the Administrative Procedure Act. After a series of district court rulings, the case went to the Supreme Court, which had to decide whether the Biden administration had lawfully terminated the program, and whether immigration law, specifically 8 U.S.C § 1225, required the continuation of MPP. On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision in favor of the Biden administration, ruled that DHS had lawfully terminated the MPP program, consistent with both federal immigration law and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court also disagreed with the Fifth Circuit’s decision, which contended that 8 U.S.C. § 1225 imposes a statutory obligation on the United States to return all arriving noncitizens who are not clearly admissible and whom it lacks the capacity to detain, to a contiguous territory, such as Mexico. The Fifth Circuit argued that in order to comply with this obligation, DHS had to reinstate MPP. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the language of the provision that allows for contiguous territory return is optional—may return instead of must return—and that the Fifth Circuit had incorrectly turned the discretionary provision into a mandatory provision because DHS had insufficient capacity to detain all arriving noncitizens who&hellip;",

    "content": "ESG—investing and operating according to environmental, social, and governance principles—is having a moment of sorts. The daily news cycle seems dominated by ESG. One day it’s Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida saying the state will not “be commandeered by Wall Street financial firms” that “impose an ideological agenda” under the banner of ESG. Another day it’s Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall dismissing ESG as “the left’s new way of imposing their worldview on the country.” Or, on the Democratic side, it’s California Governor Gavin Newsom, trying to put the state on a path to carbon neutrality but having to purchase power from fossil fuel plants to get the state through summer heat. Oh, and of course there’s Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweet that “ESG is a scam,” liked over 300,000 times and retweeted more than 42,000 times. This followed the company’s removal from the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index due to environmental and social problems cited by the index. It can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate critiques of ESG and political posturing. Over the next several weeks, through a series of content and conversations, the Bipartisan Policy Center will explore the heated rhetoric around ESG, recent actions of policymakers around the country, and what they mean for corporations, workers, retirees, communities, and the next Congress. We’re kicking off this series, The ESG Debate, with a recent conversation on the subject between BPC Senior Advisor Tim Doyle and SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, along with the following Q&amp;A addressing points of confusion and debate over ESG. To get the series started, we tried to address some of the (basic) questions we frequently ask ourselves. We hope it is helpful to others who might get lost in fights over fiduciary duty, materiality, and more. Is ESG New? No. The origin of ESG as a formal framework for investment, asset management, and corporate operations traces back to 2005, when the United Nations and others held a conference and subsequently produced a report, Who Cares Wins. Efforts to push corporate social responsibility and “sustainable” investing had been underway for many years. Since then, ESG has grown enormously as both an investment strategy and a corporate guideline. By the end of 2021, ESG mutual fund and exchange-traded fund assets had reached $400 billion—a record. Nearly all companies in the S&amp;P 500 release ESG information of one kind or another. Financial traction, however, has clearly not translated into universal tolerance. Why All the Sound and Fury Now? Politics, naturally. Political polarization, glaringly evident in so much of American life, was bound to reach corporate America sooner or later. Researchers have found evidence that executive teams at large corporations have become more politically polarized. Some high-profile public companies have spoken out against certain state laws, leading politicians, especially at the state level, to blacklist companies that they see as “woke.” The above statement from Gov. DeSantis was delivered when the governor announced last month that the state’s public pension managers had adopted his proposal to consider only “pecuniary&hellip;",

    "content": "In January 2023 the Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) model launches, becoming the first new Medicare rural provider type in over 25 years. Congress developed the REH program to keep financially strained rural hospitals from closing and help them better align their services with the evolving needs of their communities. Specifically, the new REH designation will allow communities to transform inpatient hospitals into emergency and outpatient care facilities and adjust payment incentives to reflect a widespread shift from traditional inpatient services to outpatient settings. Today, one in five Americans lives in a rural community where access to local and convenient health services is far from a given. Rural residents on average travel twice as far as their urban counterparts to receive health care services. And with the closure of 138 rural hospitals over the last 10 years, the situation for many has only worsened. Of the hospitals that have kept their doors open, many have had been forced to cut important services such as obstetrics units. While rural hospitals benefited from federal financial assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, early evidence shows that many rural hospitals will struggle again to make ends meet when the federal relief ends, making the success of the new Rural Emergency Hospital model critical. This opportunity for rural hospitals to transform and focus more on emergency and outpatient services holds great promise, but much of the program’s success depends on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) implementation of REH and Congress’s willingness to pass needed legislative fixes. Why are rural hospitals closing? Rural health care has long centered on inpatient hospital services. However, the need for inpatient care has diminished as medical advancements and innovations have allowed many common procedures to shift to the outpatient setting. For example, certain invasive and therapeutic surgeries that providers used to perform primarily in inpatient settings, such as cataract surgery or certain knee and hernia repairs, now commonly take place in ambulatory settings where patients are in and out the same day. Meanwhile, rural populations continue to shrink, reducing the need for inpatient hospital beds. Over the last decade, the number of people living in rural areas declined by 0.5%, or 226,000 people, while urban areas grew by about 8%, or roughly 21 million people. Taken together, these trends have decreased the number of rural residents needing inpatient hospital care and, in turn, negatively impacted the finances of small rural hospitals whose reimbursement structures typically depend on maintaining certain levels of inpatient care. Policymakers support a new care delivery and reimbursement model The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 created the REH program for rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds. It gives rural communities a new care delivery option within the Medicare program and allows communities to transform inpatient hospitals into emergency and outpatient care facilities. Under the new program, REH facilities will be reimbursed for patient care via the Medicare outpatient prospective payment system. In addition, REHs will receive a new, additional “facility payment” that stakeholders hope will&hellip;",

    "content": "Informal child care options are a vital, and misunderstood component of the child care ecosystem.  Parents choose informal options (child care provided by relatives, parents, non-relative friends, neighbors, or nannies) for a variety of reasons, but most often it is because the formal child care system fails to meet parents’ needs. Formal child care centers operate under razor-thin profit margins and are suffering from staff shortages, which prevent many centers from better serving families by providing non-traditional hours of care and addressing transportation issues families may face and providing care at affordable costs to the community. Many formal care settings are extremely costly, which can be especially prohibitive for low-income families who face many structural barriers, in addition to not being able to afford tuition. Informal child care is attractive to parents not only because it is more affordable, but also because it is flexible, especially for parents working non-traditional hours (i.e., those who work in retail, construction, or health care). Many parents also turn to informal care to find a caregiver who shares their cultural background, or because they have a child who may need more one-on-one care than can be provided in a formal care setting. What is Family, Friend, and Neighbor Care? Informal care refers to arrangements where child care is provided by a relative, friend, or neighbor, to a small number of children, often related. It is frequently referred to as Family, Friend and Neighbor care, “FFN” as defined by Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). Depending on state child care licensing regulations, there may be varying requirements for informal care providers to access public financial support. Furthermore, in some cases, the term FFN is used to imply there is a lot of either “illegal or underground” child care. The term “FFN” is misleading. It implies relatives, friends, and neighbors are equally prevalent. BPC has repeatedly surveyed parents on this question and found that most informal care is actually provided by the parents themselves. When relatives are used the care is overwhelmingly provided by grandparent(s). Using the “FFN” term also suggests that relatives and non-relatives follow a similar set of state regulations, which is untrue. Unpacking Parents’ Use of Informal Care BPC’s May 2022 survey of 1,000 parents who do not use formal child care is a continuation of our commitment to understanding the United States’ child care gap. When asked to indicate their primary child care arrangement, 68% of respondents reported using care provided by themselves, their partners, or a combination. Regarding the rest of the findings, 25% of parents rely on relatives, and only 4% report using a non-relative friend or neighbor as their primary child care arrangement. Our data demonstrates care that falls under the “Family, Friend, and Neighbor,” definition is most likely to be “family.” Neighbors and friends represent a tiny portion of informal child care. Prior BPC surveys had similar findings, ranging from 3% to 5%. Rural and Native American parents, who typically experience greater challenges accessing formal child care,&hellip;",

    "content": "While the word “startup” may be associated with technology, its not just startups or Silicon Valley companies that use technology to power their businesses these days. Use of digital tools—programs, software, or applications that run on a digital device—are common across most small businesses and have only become more so during the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s just one of the findings from the Bipartisan Policy Center’s recent report, Small Businesses Go Digital: Benefits, Trends, and Barriers of Digitalization. Drawing on survey data from small business owners and managers, the report finds widespread use of digital tools among small businesses. Underneath that headline, however, there are meaningful differences in the tools small businesses use and their plans to invest in new digital tools based on the size of the small business—not to mention differences based on the race, gender, and geographic location of the small business owner. More than 90%&#8211;of small businesses in the United States have fewer than 10 employees. These microbusinesses use digital tools at similar rates to small businesses with more employees for common business activities like taking payments, managing expenses, and accounting. Differences in adoption of digital tools start to emerge as businesses add more employees and their operations become more complex. Businesses with more employees are more likely to use digital tools for more advanced business activities like monitoring key metrics or tracking inventory, than microbusinesses. Microbusinesses also tend to be more conservative than larger firms in their adoption of digital tools. Just 15% of microbusinesses with fewer than 5 employees consider themselves early adopters of digital tools, compared to 35% of small businesses with 50-100 employees. This conservative approach to digital tool adoption, coupled with differing needs based on business size, may help explain why just 42% of businesses with 1-4 employees plan to adopt digital tools within the next year, compared to 80% of businesses with 50-100 employees. Small business owners and managers in some parts of the country also take a more cautious approach than those in others. In Missouri (44%) and Iowa (45%), for example, of small business owners and managers, said they tend to be conservative with adopting new digital technology, compared to the national average of 31% and 29% in Maryland, for example. While these are just some of the differences uncovered in the report, the trend toward greater levels of digitalization, or the conversion of business practices to digital tools, is clear and likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years as small business owners and managers realize the benefits of digital tools. According to the BPC report, small businesses that use many digital tools were significantly more likely to report revenue growth in the past year. &nbsp; Small business owners and managers cite other benefits from using digital tools, including their impact on lowering costs, being easy to use, and helping manage data—all of which contribute to small businesses being able to better compete against larger businesses.

    "content": "Key Milestones The Biden administration’s goal to increase domestic offshore wind capacity to 30 gigawatts by 2030 is a strong signal for the technology’s importance to the clean energy transition and meeting climate goals. Industry “firsts” for U.S. offshore wind in the past 12 months have included: Breaking ground on the country’s first and second utility-scale projects—Vineyard Wind and South Fork Wind—located off the New England coast near Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York. Holding a record-breaking offshore wind lease auction off the New York coast. The New York Bight sale brought in nearly $4.4 billion and represents the nation’s highest-grossing competitive offshore energy lease sale in history, including oil and gas lease sales. Bringing new wind energy areas to the coasts of the Central Atlantic (North Carolina to Delaware), Pacific (northern California and Oregon), and Gulf of Mexico regions. Recent Federal Policy Developments Major new laws in the past two years provide much-needed certainty for the growing industry. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 provided foundational funding for U.S. offshore wind, including: $27 billion for improvements to the U.S. power grid’s resiliency and reliability, $2.25 billion for the Department of Transportation Port Infrastructure Development Program, $25 million for the DOT Marine Highways Program, and authorization for energy storage on the outer continental shelf. These programs are designed to ease the construction and integration process for offshore wind developments. The law also appropriates $100 million for wind energy research authorized in the Energy Act of 2020. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included several offshore wind provisions, including financing provisions that BPC identified as an overarching policy need in our Offshore Wind Issue Brief. These include $100 million for activities related to development of transmission for offshore wind energy, updates to existing renewable energy investment and production tax credits, and a new tax credit for the domestic production of wind components and equipment like specialized offshore wind installation vessels. State Leadership States are critical in establishing the policy environment necessary to grow the offshore wind industry. The East Coast states of Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia have collectively committed to procuring 32 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. In June 2021, a bipartisan group of nine East Coast governors wrote to the Biden administration outlining their priorities for offshore wind expansion. Then in June 2022, the administration announced the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership, formalizing workstreams between 11 states (the original nine plus North Carolina and Pennsylvania) and the federal government (Departments of the Interior, Energy, and Transportation, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). This partnership is in line with BPC’s recommendation for enhanced federal, state, and interregional coordination, and seeks to strengthen the U.S. offshore wind supply chain through coordination with existing efforts in domestic manufacturing capacity, logistics networks, ocean co-use, transmission and interconnectedness, and workforce development.

The legislation is a scaled back version of the previously proposed Build Back Better Act, which included $150 billion in housing-related spending—none of which made it into the IRA. However, the bill did include $369 billion for climate resilience and energy security programs, including provisions to promote energy efficiency and energy affordability in homes and to decarbonize buildings to meet greenhouse gas reduction goals. Here are the key housing-related provisions in the legislation, which include $18 billion in federal grants as well as an estimated $36.5 billion in tax credits over ten years. Grant Programs Consumer home energy rebate programs for energy efficiency retrofits and electrification—$8.8 billion The bill includes two Department of Energy (DOE) rebate programs: The Home Energy Performance-Based, Whole-House Rebates (HOMES) program provides $4.3 billion in rebates for home energy-saving retrofits—with up to $4,000 available for most homeowners and up to $8,000 available for households earning less than 80% of the area median income. The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program provides $4.5 billion for grants to states and Tribes to administer rebate programs for electric home appliances for low- and middle-income recipients (they must earn less than 150% the area median income). The program provides up to $14,000 per household including $8,000 for heat pumps, $1,750 for heat pump water heaters, and $840 for electric stoves, as well as rebates for improvements to electrical wiring. Energy and water efficiency for affordable housing—$1 billion The bill provides funding to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for a new grant program supporting climate efforts in affordable housing projects. The program is targeted to owners or sponsors of properties in the Section 8 project-based rental assistance program, Section 236 program, Section 202 housing for the elderly, and Section 811 housing for people with disabilities. Eligible activities include: Improve energy and water efficiency Enhance indoor air quality or sustainability Implement the use of zero-emission electricity generation, low-emission building materials or processes, energy storage, or building electrification strategies Improve climate resilience Incentives for states and localities to update energy codes—$1 billion This Department of Energy funding supports states and local governments seeking to implement energy codes that meet or exceed the latest International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) standards. $670 million of the funds will be made available to support the adoption of building codes that meet zero-energy standards. Grants for Energy Efficiency Contractor Training—$200 million This DOE grant program provides state energy offices with the resources to train contractors to carry out energy efficiency upgrades, including for homes. Grants for clean energy technology in low-income and disadvantaged communities—$7 billion The IRA includes $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a clean energy technology accelerator, to be administered by the EPA. $7 billion of this funding is dedicated to competitive grants for deploying (or helping to provide) clean energy technology, including home installments such as rooftop solar&hellip;",

Campus Happenings Confusion Arises Over Executive Branch’s Abortion Viewpoint Neutrality Brianna Atkinson | The Daily Tar Heel | August 24, 2022 Following the U.S. Supreme Court Dobbs decision, the UNC Office of the Student Body President issued an executive order that it would not distribute “funds to any business, organization or individual that actively advocates against reproductive health care.” The order raised concerns with free speech advocates. In response, the associate vice chancellor and senior university counsel asserted the order does not affect campus clubs; the student body president wrote that the order “does not affect any other registered organizations” while the UNC Board of Trustees adopted a resolution requiring the student government to distribute funds in a viewpoint neutral way. California, Berkeley University Law School Student Orgs Pledge to Boycott Zionist, Pro-Israel Speakers Adam Sabes | Fox News | August 28, 2022 Nine student organizations at the University of California, Berkeley have adopted a “pro-Palestine bylaw, agreeing to not “invite speakers who support Zionism or ‘the apartheid state of Israel.’” Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky responded in a letter to all student organization leaders calling the statement “troubling” and reaffirmed the institution’s commitment to free expression and the First Amendment. Letter Regarding Proposed Free Expression Statement From MIT L. Rafael Reif | MIT News Office | September 1, 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology President L. Rafael Reif endorsed the Statement on Freedom of Expression and Academic Freedom proposed by MIT’s Ad Hoc Working Group on Free Expression. The working group, convened last fall after the invitation to deliver the Carlson Lecture was withdrawn from Dorian Abbott, issued a report on its findings and 10 recommendations addressing the purpose and place of campus free expression. Simultaneously, the provost, chancellor, and chair of the faculty sent a letter inviting the faculty to discuss the statement. Carnegie Mellon University Professor&#8217;s Critical Tweet about Queen Elizabeth II Goes Viral Jesse Bunch | Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| September 9, 2022 Carnegie Mellon University commented on a CMU tenured professor’s tweet expressing ill wishes for the dying Queen Elizabeth II: “We do not condone the offensive and objectionable messages posted by Uju Anya on her personal social media account.

Fortunately, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law permanently authorized the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council), which is tasked with improving interagency coordination and reducing timelines for project approvals, among other policy changes to improve permitting. In the third event of our series “Implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” BPC, the National Association of Counties, and the National League of Cities hosted Christine Harada, Executive Director of the Permitting Council. Ms. Harada works with thirteen federal agencies, state agencies, and project sponsors to develop and implement specific timetables for project reviews and approvals. She handles a $100 billion portfolio of large-scale infrastructure projects, most of which are in renewable energy, coastal restoration, and electrical transmission. Here are a few main themes from the event. The Permitting Council improves project timelines through interagency coordination. The Permitting Council brings transparency, clarity, and predictability to permitting. The Permitting Council is crucial to “unsticking” climate projects.

    "content": "Eleven states and the District of Columbia have now enacted paid family leave programs. While these programs vary in their design, most of them utilize a public social insurance model. In contrast, the state of Virginia recently enacted a law that employs a different approach – one that seeks to expand access to paid family leave by establishing the benefit as a class of insurance that private insurers can offer to employers. Throughout the country, employers commonly purchase various forms of insurance to provide non-wage benefits like disability and life insurance. Virginia is among the first states to enact a law establishing paid family leave as a form of private insurance that employers can voluntarily purchase for their employees. Qualifying events for workers to use the benefit include time off for the birth or adoption of a child, a foster care placement, a serious personal health condition or a serious health condition of a family member, or a family member who currently is or will be on military active duty. Additionally, the policy may be included as part of a group disability insurance policy or purchased as its own group insurance policy, allowing employers more flexibility. Two other states utilize similar private insurance models, but with more significant state involvement. In New York, employers must carry a paid family leave insurance policy from a private insurance market that the state strictly regulates. Meanwhile, New Hampshire is preparing to offer voluntary paid family leave benefits through a private insurer, with the state government selecting a single carrier and purchasing coverage for its public employees to establish a risk pool. While Virginia’s law does not establish a state-wide paid family leave mandate or a universal social insurance program, it is expected to expand access to the benefit. In today’s tight labor market, employers are increasingly offering competitive compensation to gain an edge in hiring. With 73% of Virginians supporting paid family leave, the new law enables more employers to include paid family leave in the competitive compensation packages needed to attract and retain workers. Moreover, by giving private insurers flexibility to design their paid family leave policies, Virginia is establishing a marketplace where insurers are able to compete with one another and design different policies that address the needs of diverse businesses and employees. While there are advantages to the voluntary nature of the law, Virginia’s policy provides no guarantee that employers will utilize the insurance to offer a paid leave benefit to their employees. Additionally, the law does not establish minimum standards for benefit size, maximum duration, or other characteristics that influence benefit quality. Though this creative approach will help employers provide paid family leave, state lawmakers should take two key additional steps to support its success. First, to ensure utilization, the state should actively promote the law to raise awareness among business owners. Second, the state should collect the data necessary to understand the impact of the law in expanding access to paid family leave. Doing so will be critical&hellip;",

    "content": "Being a single parent is hard, but not uncommon: A quarter of American children (25.8%), or approximately 19.17 million, live with one parent. While there are misconceptions about rates of unemployment among single parents, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that in families maintained by mothers, she was employed 72.5% of the time and the father was employed 82.6% of the time in families maintained by fathers. Given the high employment numbers among single parents, it is important to consider their child care needs and preferences to best support them as they support their families. BPC’s recent survey of the one-third of employed parents using informal child care (child care from relatives, parents, non-relative friends, neighbors, or nannies) sheds light on whether single parents’ child care choices are a matter of preference or necessity. Of the 1,000 respondents surveyed, approximately 25% were not married or partnered, as is representative of the US. This survey did not disaggregate never married and divorced/separated parents in this data. Who is Caring for the Kids? Similarly to married parents, 59% of single parents surveyed said formal child care is unappealing, while 41% said it is inaccessible. 72% percent of single parents using informal care either provide care for their child themselves or use relatives. Only 39% of single parents pay for their informal care arrangement, making informal care a more affordable option for many. Arranging relative care requires living close to those relatives, and this survey revealed that a significant number of families moved for child care. These statistics were even higher for single parents: Almost a quarter (24%) of single parents using informal child care say they moved closer to a family member so that member could provide care for their child, compared with 15% of married/partnered parents. As teachers and child development specialists well know, consistency and stability are vital to children’s developmental success. Disruptions such as pulling a child out of a care program and moving can be deeply upsetting for a child. During our recent webinar, “What Keeps Employed Parents Out of the Child Care System?” we spoke with single father Nathan (Nate) Fabre about his choice of child care for his two kids. Nate is from the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, where he works for the police department. He moved home from Mille Lacs, where his children attended a formal child care program, because he “was paying more for child care than for everything else and couldn’t afford it anymore.” At home, his grandmother and other relatives were able to care for his children while he worked. While those relatives provided great care, Nate described the experience as a “shocker for my children,” and told BPC that he felt “really horrible taking them out of that day care.” Flexibility is More Important for Single Parents Crucially, informal care offers parents flexibility, especially for last minute schedule adjustments or nontraditional work hours. Single parents particularly need flexibility, as they are less likely to know their work schedules in advance:&hellip;",

    "content": "With a national shortage of homes for sale and rent, affordable housing is increasingly out of reach for a growing number of Americans. As the primary regulators of land-use and zoning policies, local governments are perhaps best positioned to reform policies that limit the supply of housing. However, state governments can also play a significant role in increasing housing production and preservation and improving housing affordability. Below are five meaningful actions that states can take. 1. Coordinate affordable housing financing across multiple funding sources. Financing for affordable housing production relies on a complicated matrix of funding sources, often called the “capital stack.” These sources can include tax credits, housing bonds, private equity, and grants. Accessing these financing options often requires separate and complex applications and administrative processes. By serving as a clearinghouse for these various funding options, a state can help expedite the application process and enhance the ability of developers to formulate a successful capital stack. Examples of how states have implemented this clearinghouse function include: Creating a consolidated application to access available funding sources. Massachusetts is often cited as a model for its consolidated application and its statewide agency that coordinates financing support. Signing memorandums of understanding (MOUs). Instead of creating a new government office or agency to facilitate financing, some states use MOUs. In an MOU, a state can formalize a framework for stakeholders to coordinate application requirements and share developers’ documentation. 2. Leverage tax incentives, grants, and other funding to spur office-to-housing conversions. The pandemic, with the attendant rise in remote work, has underscored the overcapacity of office space in many cities and towns and revealed a potentially valuable source of new housing. Yet many of the buildings most likely to be suitable for conversion to housing have aging components or hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead, making remodeling complicated and cost prohibitive. States can support office-to-housing conversions through financial incentives such as tax credits and grants. In fact, some states are drawing upon American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) monies to provide needed financing for office-to-housing conversions. For example, Pennsylvania is working with local officials in Pittsburgh, PA to use ARPA money to support these conversions. In December 2021, the District of Columbia government issued a request for information on suggested incentives that would encourage renovating commercial properties to residential. California has a provision in its historic renovation tax credit that allows developers to claim a 25% tax credit against personal income and corporation taxes for qualified rehabilitation expenses for projects that will contain affordable housing. 3. Create a clearinghouse of programs that support home repairs and improvements. Preservation through home improvement is an important way to maintain an affordable housing supply.

Previous blogs in this series have explored the current state of the smart home industry and how standardization may alter the market. This blog will examine the future of cybersecurity for smart devices with consideration of the broader impact of proposed legislation. Cybersecurity Risks with Smart Homes Though new internet of things devices unlock new possibilities for utility and convenience, each new device also introduces a new opening for potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks. Recent years have seen numerous disturbing attacks on connected devices, illustrating the potential for harm that accompanies the technology, from baby monitor cameras being used to spy on families to smart thermometers being remotely set to dangerously high temperatures to Peloton bikes being maliciously accessed by a third party, a wide variety of devices have been and continue to be targeted. These attacks are often carried out through weaknesses in encryption protocols, improper storage of user data and credentials, failure to install security updates, or other vulnerabilities along any stage of the smart home stack. Beyond gaining access to the most immediate data from the device itself, these attacks are dangerous because access to a singular poorly secured part of a smart home can provide malicious actors wider control and information about other devices on a network. As a 2019 report by Trend Micro detailed, access to a singular part of a smart home, like an automation server that governs the rules and interactions of other devices in the home, could be leveraged to set commands which automatically control other parts of a network. For example, smart door locks could be set to unlock automatically at a certain time of day, or smart speakers to bypass voice authentication security checks by other devices. These attacks are particularly alarming because, in some cases, they may not require complex, technical exploits but rather leverage simple methods like easy-to-guess or repeated passwords. Because many users will use a single password across many or all their accounts across the internet, data breaches that reveal a user’s email and password combination for a single website can be used to gain access to many others. Another common weakness comes from smart devices, which frequently ship with a simple, singular default password many users fail to change, giving hackers even easier access. Cybersecurity Tradeoffs &amp; Current Legislation Though technologies like two-factor authentication can help to prevent these breaches, some companies are hesitant to adopt requirements for such technologies because they make the log-in and user experience more cumbersome for users by increasing “friction.” Particularly for brands like Google’s Nest, which aim to expand access to smart devices by making them simple to use, they face a legitimate tradeoff between security and ease of access. As the second blog in this series discussed, the smart home market remains highly competitive, and development costs can incentivize a lack of robust back-end security&hellip;",

    "content": "With the rapid rise of internet-connected smart devices, the data that these devices produce on their users has grown at an unprecedented scale. Providing valuable insights into the way that people live, work, and behave, questions also surround the collection, storage, and sharing of smart home data. Previous blogs in this series discussed the current state of the smart home industry, interoperability, and cybersecurity. This final blog will explore privacy and data use issues with consideration of current and potential privacy legislation and its potential impacts on the smart home industry. Data Collection and Sharing Today, many smart device manufacturers collect and store massive amounts of user data with little government oversight, and users lack clarity about what information is being collected and stored. Companies often accumulate these extensive collections of any data they can get, regardless of relevance, under the defense that the user data is necessary for making improvements to technologies used in the devices, like voice recognition. For example, there are many instances in which smart speakers actively recorded users’ conversations in their homes without the users’ unawareness or consent. The data produced from smart homes is powerful not only because of its direct uses but also in the ways that it can interact with the other information gathered about users online. Tech companies have been creating increasingly comprehensive and detailed profiles for their users, spanning data from a multitude of different sources and often referred to as a form of “big data.” This is particularly relevant given the trend of tech companies expanding to offer multiple, wide-ranging products and services, which each produce their own unique forms of data. For example, when paired with movement patterns from a mapping app, purchase data from a shopping app, and search data from a search engine, smart home data could grant companies immense knowledge and power to predict and profit off users’ lives. Each of these additional sources increases the predictive power and accuracy of these profiles and the models that they power. While this data can be used in familiar cases like targeted advertising, recent years have also seen companies laying the groundwork for more sophisticated applications. A 2018 report described recent efforts by insurance companies to gather immense amounts of wide-ranging data on subjects like TV viewing habits, timeliness of rent payments, and online purchase histories to further optimize insurance rates and risk assessment. With an ever-growing amount of information being collected and analyzed, these applications seem poised to grow more common. User Knowledge and the Privacy Paradox For policymakers weighing regulation of the smart home industry, considerations over data collection are particularly relevant because of the privacy paradox or the dichotomy between people’s claimed interest in privacy and their actual actions to provide personal information. The term, coined in a 2007 research paper, states the privacy paradox is “the relationship between individuals’ intentions to disclose personal information and their actual personal information disclosure behaviors.” A more recent 2019 study found this dichotomy exists for smart devices&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress continues to make progress on SECURE 2.0, bipartisan legislation aimed at bolstering Americans’ personal savings for both emergencies and retirement. BPC has long supported efforts to enhance Americans’ financial security. In fact, several provisions currently under consideration were recommended by our 2016 Commission on Retirement Security and Personal Savings, and some were previously adopted in SECURE 2.0’s predecessor, the 2019 Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act. With three iterations of SECURE 2.0 at various stages of the legislative process (passed on the House floor in March and advanced by the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions in June), lawmakers must make consequential decisions about the final bill. Here is what they should keep in mind. Boosting Retirement Savings Is the Name of the Game SECURE 2.0’s primary focus is enhancing Americans’ retirement savings by closing coverage gaps and expanding incentives for employers to offer and savers to participate in workplace retirement plans. A BPC-Morning Consult poll found that only 52% of individuals with household income at or below $50,000 have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, compared to 79% of people with higher household income. Moreover, small businesses, which employ 47% of American workers, often report that the financial and administrative obligations associated with setting up a retirement plan for their workers deter them from doing so. As a result, their employees disproportionately struggle to save for retirement: Less than one-third of employees at the smallest companies save for retirement compared to nearly two-thirds of those at the largest. Several provisions on the table would advance this goal and address existing inequities in retirement saving. For example, a core set of provisions in the House and Senate versions of SECURE 2.0 would address challenges that low- and moderate-earners face by: allowing student loan payments to qualify for matching employer contributions to retirement accounts, ensuring that more part-time workers can participate in retirement plans, and enhancing the Saver’s Credit. The Senate Finance Committee’s proposal goes a step further by making the Saver’s Credit fully refundable, expanding its support and saving incentive to many earners who have no federal income tax liability. All versions of SECURE 2.0 also allow 403(b) plans—401(k)-type plans typically provided by nonprofit organizations—to participate in multiple employer plans, which are premised on permitting smaller employers to offer the same type of retirement benefit as larger organizations without bearing the full administrative burden of offering such a plan. Increasing the use of automatic enrollment and automatic escalation would also amplify the benefits of expanding access to retirement plans. Notably, only the House version of SECURE 2.0 currently includes the most impactful of such provisions, requiring most new retirement plans to automatically enroll eligible participants and automatically increase contributions by one percentage point (up to 10% of wages) annually. (Participants would retain the ability to opt out.) The Senate bills include various incentives for plans to adopt automatic features. Such approaches can significantly increase participation and saving rates; recent&hellip;",

    "content": "Last week, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a new law passed under the complicated budget reconciliation process with health and climate provisions. But as Democrats celebrate the bill’s passage after a long partisan process, it’s worth noting that there was a brief attempt to address Medicare’s solvency, an issue that we at BPC have long held concerns about. Why mention this unsuccessful attempt? Because it demonstrates at least some congressional interest in Medicare’s solvency, something beyond the rhetoric of Medicare for All or privatizing Medicare. Two key estimates this year extended the life of Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund: the Medicare Trustees report moved its estimate from 2026 to 2028, and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate moved from 2027 to 2030. Last year had been the closest point that we have seen to the HI Trust Fund’s insolvency in two decades yet that warning resulted in little discussion on Capitol Hill as to how to address the fund’s looming insolvency. Of course, the term “solvency” does not apply neatly to the four parts of Medicare, and focusing solely on which parts can go “insolvent” can gloss over Medicare’s overall fiscal state. For instance, the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, which funds inpatient, or Part A, services, is financed through payroll taxes and can go insolvent, in which case the federal government would have to decide to step in and pay for beneficiary services or cut back on benefits. But the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund –for outpatient, or Part B, services—technically cannot go “insolvent” because it automatically draws down general revenues in addition to collecting premiums from beneficiaries. The draw down from general revenues though crowds out funding for other public programs. Part C, which is the Medicare Advantage program, is financed through beneficiaries’ premiums and payments from Parts A and B so part of its future is tied to Part A. Part D, which funds Medicare’s privately-run drug benefit, is financed similar to Part B and mostly through general revenue and beneficiaries’ premiums. (The IRA will change the structure of Part D plans.) Protecting Medicare’s financial status should be a bipartisan issue, not handled through the highly partisan reconciliation process. We need stakeholders to come together to address these fundamental fiscal challenges to ensure that Medicare works well for future generations before considering expansions that may not be fiscally sound. Indeed, Medicare’s solvency was one rationale that ended a proposal to expand Medicare benefits to include hearing, vision, and dental benefits. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) commented that he could not vote to expand Medicare’s benefits given its long-term fiscal challenges. With support from Arnold Ventures, BPC is addressing these issues. After the 2022 Medicare Trustees report was released on June 2, 2022, we hosted a webinar on the policy and political ramifications from the report. A key takeaway was that this extension should not cause us to breathe a sigh of relief. These new predictions only underscore the volatility we are facing—both politically and economically—and the&hellip;",

    "content": "As climate hazards—including floods, storms, wildfires, and rising sea levels—become increasingly catastrophic, building up resilience is critical to protect the health, safety, housing, and economic vitality of communities across the nation. Historically, governments have focused narrowly on post-disaster response without sufficient planning and capacity-building for future hazards, but recent efforts to create Chief Resilience Offices (CROs), at all levels of government, are attempting to change that. What is a Chief Resilience Office? A CRO serves as a leading entity for coordinating efforts across government agencies to mitigate risks and protect both communities and the environment. Resilience efforts at the local, state, and federal level require smooth interagency collaboration to implement comprehensive plans leveraging the capacity of multiple departments. Such coordination works best when a single entity is tasked with leading implementation of the plan, as government efforts are too often inefficient and siloed between agencies. The CRO typically works with a wide breadth of stakeholders to develop a resiliency strategy. CROs are not an entirely new concept. The Rockefeller Foundation formed the 100 Resilient Cities program in 2013 and gave two years of seed funding for cities to hire their own Chief Resilience Officers, including most major cities in the U.S. However, maintaining these offices without stable funding has been expensive and difficult. Twelve states have created CROs through executive order or legislation—Maryland being the most recent, establishing a CRO in May. Other states do not use the title Chief Resilience Officer but have offices in place to carry out similar missions. &nbsp; Examples of State CROs Existing state CROs have profoundly enhanced statewide disaster preparedness and offer examples of what CROs entail and the benefits they can provide: Colorado: The Colorado Resiliency Office builds community resilience by working to identify needs and best practices and then dispense appropriate guidance and technical assistance. Through its Roadmap Program, Colorado’s CRO brings together 16 regional community teams, made up of local public and private partners, to identify shared regional priorities to implement over two-year periods. The Colorado CRO also has a program focused on rural resiliency, including grant funding and workshops. To provide guidance and technical assistance, the CRO provides their staff directory of hands-on assistance, hosts workshops and monthly virtual exchanges for local leaders to collaborate and publishes resource pages for wildfire recovery. North Carolina: The North Carolina Resiliency Office provides support through two agency-led programs. The Regions Innovating for Strong Economies and Environment (RISE) program provides communities in storm-impacted regions with technical assistance to assess vulnerabilities, hosts regional leadership training workshops, and develops a community resiliency guide. The Resilient Coastal Communities Program (RCCP) helps local governments to build resiliency to coastal hazards by prioritizing community engagement, supporting risk and vulnerability assessments, and developing and implementing key resiliency projects. Recent Legislation to Establish CROs Two bipartisan bills, introduced this Congress, aim to promote CROs—one to support state offices and one to create a federal CRO: H.R. 7178, the Champion Local Efforts to Advance Resiliency (CLEAR) Act: The CLEAR Act would create&hellip;",

The conventional narrative about border cities tends to focus exclusively on border enforcement, but the southern border region—spanning from California to Texas— is a key economic engine for the United States, with immigrant entrepreneurs at the center. In the absence of any significant legislation from Congress supporting immigrant entrepreneurs, municipalities along the border, like others in the country, have stepped in to fill the gap, recognizing the valuable contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs to their economies and their city&#8217;s success. Border regions are unique in part because they are connected across borders by cultures, history, families, schoolchildren, tourists, and businesses. Compared to other regions in the United States, border residents are twice as likely to be immigrants; in California, 26% of border residents are immigrants, followed closely by Texas with 21%. In both San Diego and El Paso, the national trend in which immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs than their American-born counterparts holds true. In these cities, immigrant entrepreneurs work in main street businesses as well as high tech firms, bolstering local immigrant communities and participating in the broader economies of the regions. World-wide, immigrant entrepreneurs help create jobs, meet regional needs, and foster innovation, serving as a crucial cultural and economic link between cities across borders. San Diego, CA The San Diego-Tijuana megaregion has a population of over 5 million and a GDP of $230 billion. The economies of the two cities are connected through trade, industry, and labor creating a significant economic cluster. In San Diego, 25% of the population identifies as immigrants or refugees, who contribute $22 billion in spending power and $9 billion in tax revenue per year to the local economy. Of this population, 64,181, or 9% of the immigrant population, are entrepreneurs. In 2019, the city government began working with stakeholders across sectors to develop the Welcoming San Diego Strategic Plan, an initiative to further immigrant integration. Welcoming San Diego aims to invest in the immigrant communities by increasing economic opportunity, enhancing civic participation, and expanding data collection and impact evaluation. The overarching goal is to provide resources, help entrepreneurs overcome barriers, and create a system that allows immigrants to thrive. In July 2022, Mayor Todd Gloria of San Diego announced the creation of the Office of Immigrant Affairs, which will work to implement the Welcoming San Diego Strategic Plan, focus on workforce development for immigrant communities, and develop resources for newly arrived immigrants. Nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations play a significant role in furthering the Welcoming San Diego initiative through advocacy efforts and by providing funding and training opportunities for immigrant entrepreneurs.

Last month, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation advanced two bipartisan privacy bills focused on youth: S.3663- Kids Online Safety Act and S.1628- Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act. Earlier this summer, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed the bipartisan American Data Privacy and Protection Act, legislation to create federal privacy regulations regardless of age. Discussed in this post are the most recent versions of the Senate bills as amended during committee markup on July 27th. Kids Online Safety Act The Kids Online Safety Act was initially introduced in February 2022 by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and has since added several co-sponsors from both parties. The bill outlines protections for minors, which it defines as anyone 16 years of age or younger. The key provisions are: Obliges firms to act in the best interests of minors. This means that internet platforms will have a duty to take reasonable measures in the design and operation of products to prevent an enumerated list of harms to minors. Included in this list are mental health harms, addiction, physical violence, bullying, sexual exploitation, and deceptive marketing practices. Provides safeguards and tools for parents and minors. Platforms must create certain safeguards to protect minors, such as limiting time, deleting data, opting out of recommendation systems, restricting geolocation data collection, limiting the ability to be contacted by a stranger, and reducing addictive features. Platforms also must provide parents with tools to protect minors, like restricting financial purchases, controlling privacy settings, tracking total time spent, and opt-outing out of certain features. These safeguards and tools must default to the setting which provides the most protection over privacy and security for the user. Requires disclosure of harms and how to access the safeguards and tools. Platforms must disclose to parents and minors prior to usage their policies towards minors, info about how to access safeguards, and potential harms of the platforms. Mandates annual third-party audits to identify risks and mitigations. The audit shall cover the prevalence and usage by minors, as well as an analysis of known and emerging risks to minors. The findings of the audit are required to be released publicly. Establishes a national research program to encourage independent research. The Commerce Department is tasked with defining and administering a program by which qualified researchers can undertake projects with real data from online platforms to conduct public interest research on harms to minors. Children and Teen’s Online Privacy Protection Act The Children and Teen’s Online Privacy Protection Act was formerly introduced in May 2021 by Senators Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.). The bill seeks to provide a major overhaul of the landmark Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Notably, Sen.

    "content": "On July 16, the new, three-digit 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline formally launched nationwide, replacing the 10-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. While the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) “sees 988 as a first step towards a transformed crisis care system in America,” advocates, stakeholders, policymakers, mental health experts, and others recognize that major barriers—such as limited resources and a lack of coordination between relevant state and federal agencies—exist in the effort to bring all fifty states to the same baseline for crisis response. In June, BPC released a report outlining recommendations for Congress and the administration to help states overcome these barriers and build out crisis systems that are more equitable and accessible to the increasing number of Americans in need. In the wake of 988’s official launch, we asked three well-respected experts in the behavioral health space—all of whom participated in our event on the topic—to address some outstanding questions regarding 988’s implementation. How Do We Better Communicate the Functions of—and Build Trust In—988? Mary Giliberti, J.D., Chief Public Policy Officer, Mental Health America In a poll released by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, about three-quarters of U.S. adults (77%) had never heard of 988. Although SAMHSA and others have provided toolkits with sample communications, key messages, and FAQs, their scopes remain narrow, and messages were not tested on people through focus groups or other means so they may not resonate with the general population. In addition, complex messages may need to be clarified and adjusted depending on availability of services in a specific community. For instance, in some states and communities, there are robust crisis response systems with mobile teams and crisis stabilization facilities while in others, there are not, and police and EMS remain first responders in many instances. Crisis services for children also vary by location. Additionally, messaging to engage historically and continually marginalized populations has not been researched and widely promulgated. While some communities may be concerned about how calling 988 will affect their immigration status, others may be troubled by the risk of possible police involvement and racial discrimination. Furthermore, 988 text support will not be available in any language other than English, potentially alienating youth who prefer to communicate by text. Communications research and messaging would help reach all stakeholders who will interact with the new system in order to differentiate between responses from police, emergency medical technicians, hospital staff, and others. While there have been increased communications since 988’s launch, no one has fully engaged in the research and testing that is fundamental to a public health campaign designed to influence a national population. Much work should be done to ensure adequate information is provided, including information that has been tailored to the unique needs of different stakeholders and communities. To instill trust in the system, future messaging must be further developed, tested, and customized to the communities they serve to convey exactly what services will be available.

Abortion bans, regardless of how they are constructed, will have broader ramifications on all aspects of health care. For instance, many legal scholars and advocates are debating the legality of state telehealth policies that either restrict or enhance prescribing medication abortion and whether federal law can preempt or influence state laws. Dobbs has already spurred high-profile discussions on its effect on everything from insurance to medical education to digital health apps. However, some effects will not be as evident immediately. Take for example state licensure laws, an area that we have explored as part of our ongoing digital and telehealth policy work. In November 2021, BPC released a report analyzing how states and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services temporarily waived licensing rules to help promote telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. But by the end of 2021, only a handful of states had made these waivers permanent, which can be a barrier to telehealth adoption. While telehealth encounters often happen intrastate, they also occur interstate as health professionals in one state treat patients in another. While the interaction is virtual, the delivery of care occurs where the patient is located so that state’s laws govern the practice of medicine. Just as a doctor could not drive into another state and set up shop without being properly licensed in the new state, a doctor cannot “beam” into another state via the magic of the internet and practice virtually without a license. Interstate compacts have emerged to develop national—if not federal—policies to license health professionals more efficiently in multiple states. In fact, the Constitution explicitly refers to compacts and allows states to utilize them to achieve certain policy goals. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, states were forming compacts for licensing for a variety of health professionals in hopes of addressing workforce shortages. The various health professional compacts work differently. Joining a compact does not necessarily create reciprocity between member states. The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact expedites licensing applications for non-resident physicians who want to practice—whether in-person or virtually—in another state participating in a compact. Further, compacts may not waive a states’ requirements to maintain a license by taking continuing medical education or to pay licensing fees. Separate from a compact, licensing agencies share disciplinary actions so that a bad actor does not try to evade a license revocation by moving to another state. The Federation of State Medical Boards maintains a database for physician licensing so that all states can be alerted of disciplinary actions. While this arrangement is not a perfect solution for telehealth, it can be a step forward for many communities and the health professionals who serve them. For instance, in the Washington, DC metro area, Maryland and the District of Columbia have joined the physician compact, but Virginia has not. This discrepancy adds confusion and a layer of complexity for professionals who practice&hellip;",

    "content": "The immense challenges placed on the health care and caregiving sectors throughout the pandemic led the World Health Organization to deem 2021 the “Year of Health and Care Workers.” Women make up 77.6% of health care workers and bear the brunt of these challenges. Many of these workers are also parents, facing the worst of COVID-19 in their workplace and heightened caregiving needs at home. BPC and Morning Consult surveyed a national sample of 2,500 mothers in the workforce, and found that working moms today face caregiving-related barriers to financial security and advancing their careers. The poll’s results also indicate that these challenges are especially pronounced among moms working in health care professions. Worsening national shortages of health care providers—including nurses, direct care workers, behavioral health providers, and primary care physicians—are creating challenges to health care access and quality, particularly in rural areas. Consequently, there is an urgent need for policies that help working moms remain in the health care workforce. Moms in health care professions face heightened caregiving-related barriers to career advancement. Because of competing needs at work and home, moms in health care are often unable to take risks on new opportunities or pursue more demanding jobs that would advance their careers. Indeed, about half of moms working in health care said that changing jobs within the same industry is challenging when thinking about their work arrangements and caregiving responsibilities. These responsibilities can pose difficulties in other areas of mothers’ lives too, such as their physical and mental health. In particular, 46% of mothers working in the health care sector cite caregiving responsibilities as a barrier to changing jobs. Moms working in health care are highly uncomfortable with taking a new role that aligns with their career interests if it requires a significant pay cut (87%), more demanding and unpredictable hours (81%), less workplace flexibility (65%), less job security (85%), or fewer benefits (81%) – each of these responses is notably higher than those among all working moms. Caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic substantially impacted the personal lives of mothers in the health care industry. To care for their children, 67% of mothers who work in health care said that they have taken less time for themselves during the pandemic, compared to 62% of working mothers overall. Additionally, between their limited ability to work and increased expenses resulting from caregiving, working moms became more financially insecure and had to cut back their spending. Moms working in health care were no different – during the pandemic, 66% of moms working in health care reduced spending on non-essential activities and 54% reduced spending on everyday purchases, such as groceries and transportation. Paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and affordable child care would help moms working in health care advance their careers, maintain financial security, and reduce stress. Paid family leave. Moms working in health care report that paid family leave would benefit multiple facets of their lives at notably higher rates than moms working in other sectors. 61% say that&hellip;",

    "content": "For many working parents with young children, choosing a child care arrangement that works for their family is a challenge. A formal child care arrangement might be costly and inaccessible, or not meet their families’ unique needs. Instead, about 1 in 3 working parents in the U.S. with young children are using an informal child care arrangement. This means that when parents need child care, they must rely on relatives, friends, and neighbors or alter their own work schedules so one parent can be home. This May, BPC and Morning Consult conducted a national survey of 1,000 working parents with young children using informal child care to better understand what factors influenced their decision. Our survey found the additional challenges associated with having multiple young children (ages 0-5) consistently impacted parents’ decision to use an informal child care arrangement. Although there are many factors that influence a parent’s choice of child care, the number of children a family has played a role. Of the parents surveyed with multiple young children, 79% said that having more than one child under 5 influenced their child care arrangement. Parents cited increased challenges associated with cost, accessibility, and caregiver abilities as reasons why having multiple children influenced their choice of child care. Cost When asked what the most influential factor in choosing their current arrangement was, 40% of parents with multiple children referenced cost or money. A family that can afford formal care for one child may not be able to pay those rates for multiple children at once. Some parents explained that the cost of child care for multiple children was a constraining factor in choosing their arrangement: “It is hard to work with both, but we cannot afford two in daycare.” “I am not able to afford daycare for one child much less, multiple children.” “I have a 3 and 4-year-old. I had to drastically reduce my work hours, drop my position at work due to costs of child care for two kids. It wasn’t worth me paying for two kids at daycare, wouldn’t make enough working than it cost.” “The cost of care for two kids is literally more than I make, so any time there is a conflict where we can’t arrange care via family, I have to cut work.” Accessibility In addition to affordability, some parents with multiple children cited access as a barrier to using formal child care. It can be difficult to find a provider that has two open slots for their children’s ages at the same time. Rather than waiting for multiple slots to open or using separate providers for their children, some families find it easier to use an informal care arrangement. Parents surveyed explained some of the challenges accessing formal care for multiple children at once: “It is very hard to find places that take two not potty-trained babies.” “They would need to go to the same place and sometimes it is hard to find a pace that will have room for both in&hellip;",

    "content": "Introduction As the first blog in this series on smart homes explored, smart home technology brings the potential for increased connectivity, efficiency, and convenience, but also imposes new cybersecurity and privacy risks for users. Today, a lack of standardization across smart home devices and manufacturers introduces security risks and complicates the sector for users. However, the industry has taken a significant step in proposing a new communications and cybersecurity standard known as Matter. Matter aims to address many of the issues that exist today, such as interoperability or the ability for devices to exchange information with one another. This blog will explore why Matter was created as well as the potential pitfalls and changes it could bring when it launches later this year. Further, it will describe why policymakers should continue to evaluate the need for potential regulation and the standard’s impact on consumers and the market. Fragmentation and Interoperability For a variety of reasons, the smart home industry currently has poor device and system interoperability. These conditions have created an environment of fragmentation, limiting the adoption and growth of the technology by driving potential buyers away and worsening the user experience for those who do purchase smart devices. With negative impacts on both buyers and sellers, the issue of fragmentation is a substantial challenge for the industry. A significant contributing factor to fragmentation is the many platforms, apps, and systems present in the smart home ecosystem. For example, a smart lightbulb might come with an app created by the device manufacturer to control the device but also be able to interface with platforms like Amazon Echo, Google Home, or Apple HomeKit. While the lightbulb might be able to interface with multiple platforms, the platforms themselves cannot communicate with each other. Further, platforms frequently lack control over advanced, device-specific features – like the ability to synchronize light patterns with music – which are only accessible through the manufacturer’s own app. This makes it more difficult for users to control their devices and requires the use of multiple apps and accounts. This patchwork of differing platforms, standards, and compatibility confuses consumers, forcing a complex and often uninformed choice when deciding which products to purchase. Another major cause of fragmentation is the differing security requirements and costs for integration among each of the major platforms. For example, some platform owners have prioritized the wide adoption of devices on its platform by providing ample development resources (like subsidized development kits) and comparatively lax security requirements. By contrast, others have placed emphasis on security for their platform by mandating stricter encryption technology requiring more computational power, charging developers annual fees, and requiring the adoption of costly dedicated hardware. The first blog in this series briefly discussed the costs associated with implementing more sophisticated encryption techniques, and the same can be said for compatibility. Necessitated by development tradeoffs and the costs associated with compatibility, many developers have opted to either support only a single smart home platform or to make their devices work only with&hellip;",

    "content": "Housing unaffordability, rooted in an acute shortage of homes both for rent and sale, is a severe problem across the nation, affecting red states and blue states, small cities and major metropolitan areas alike. Fortunately, city governments have a great deal of influence over housing costs, with many policy levers at their disposal to increase the supply of homes and improve housing affordability. Below are ten steps local leaders can take to help constituents who are contending with high housing costs. 1. Legalize more apartment units Many American cities make it illegal to build anything other than a single-family, detached home on over 75% of land zoned for residential use, severely restricting efforts to increase the supply of affordable housing. Often, higher-income neighborhoods are disproportionately zoned for single-family homes, preventing low- and middle-income families from living in communities with more economic opportunities. While rolling back single-family zoning is one of the highest profile policies proposed to enhance affordability, early evidence from Minneapolis, which eliminated single-family zoning, indicates that such measures alone are not sufficient. Cities can also address other potentially restrictive policies, including minimum lot size requirements, density limits, and prohibitions against mixed-use developments (apartments in commercial zones) to more quickly build affordable housing at scale. 2. Legalize accessory dwelling units Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are independent residences located on the same lot as a single-family house, often in basements or above garages. ADUs are typically affordable units that diversify a city’s housing stock and make more efficient use of already-existing homes. ADUs can be a win-win for tenants and property owners, providing affordable rental units as well as benefits to homeowners—including generating income from an existing asset and adding flexibility in family living arrangements. Cities such as Seattle, WA, Princeton, N.J., and Washington, D.C., have already relaxed zoning ordinances to allow for more ADUs. Los Angeles recently announced a city-wide ADU plan as a tool to combat its affordable housing crisis. 3. Eliminate or reduce parking requirements Cities often require new buildings in a designated zone to have a certain number of designated parking spaces based on projected occupancy. Research has made clear that parking is very frequently oversupplied, with one study of six New England municipal centers, for example, finding the mandated amount of parking was, on average, two-and-a-half times more than demand at peak times. Parking minimums are also costly; building a single parking space adds an average of $50,000 in costs per housing unit in some metropolitan areas—and much more in others—with underground parking being particularly expensive. Dozens of cities have reduced or eliminated parking minimums with positive results. For example, one study found that eliminating parking minimums in Los Angeles led developers to build more homes and convert old buildings into housing, helping to stimulate neighborhood revitalization. 4. More quickly and predictably approve developments that meet zoning laws Even when zoning allows for more affordable apartments, getting new projects approved is often slow, costly, and unpredictable. Many projects require discretionary approvals, meaning local planning commissions&hellip;",

Campus Happenings “I Feel Like They Attacked Me”: KCAI Reverses Student’s Expulsion Over Twitter Posts Andrea Klick | The Kansas City Star | July 15, 2022 The Kansas City Art Institute, a private university, reversed its decision to expel an admitted student for reposting hentai, a form of pornographic anime, under a pseudonymous Twitter account.

    "content": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report finds that agriculture, forestry, and lands are critical to reaching global net-zero emissions. Strategies for increasing the quantity of carbon stored in plants, trees, and soils, and reducing emissions from agriculture and forestry—known as “natural climate solutions”—must be part of the wide portfolio of actions needed to reduce carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere and limit the pace and scale of warming this century. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Farm and Forest Solutions Task Force has identified a comprehensive set of policy recommendations addressing financial, technical assistance, and R&amp;D barriers facing a rapid scale-up of natural climate solutions in the United States. On June 29, 2022, BPC brought together experts in a public virtual event to discuss the task force recommendations and possibilities for expanding support for natural climate solutions in the upcoming 2023 Farm Bill. Provided here is a brief recap of that event. Callie Eideberg, senior professional staff on the Senate Committee on Agriculture and former member of BPC’s task force, underlined the immense significance of the Farm Bill’s reauthorization every five years, a process which allows Congress to extend, modify, or suspend any federal agriculture/forestry and food-related policies. Two important climate related programs routinely authorized in the bill are the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program, both of which help farmers undertake projects to improve environmental quality on their land. Eideberg explained that the upcoming Farm Bill is unlikely to increase funding for agriculture and forestry compared to the previous Farm Bill, so it will be up to Congress to maximize the impact of existing funding. Dr. LaKisha Odom, scientific program director at the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) and participant in BPC’s technical advisor panel, highlighted opportunities in the Farm Bill to advance soil health research beyond the current focus on row crops. FFAR connects funders with researchers and farmers to expand agriculture technology and innovation and provides funding for research on production systems that use range and pastureland. FFAR partners with The Nature Conservancy, PepsiCo, McDonald’s and others to provide matching funding to their network of farmers and ranchers. Dr. Odom pointed out that established connections with research partners in the private sector will be crucially important given the uncertainty in federal funding for agricultural innovation. Bob Izlar, founding director (retired) of the University of Georgia’s Harley Langdale, Jr. Center for Forest Business and member of BPC’s task force, stressed the urgent need for expanded nursery capacity to meet the growing demand for seedlings to plant in reforestation projects. Izlar also pointed to the longstanding Georgia Carbon Sequestration Registration as one example of how rural forestry and agriculture communities can benefit from carbon sequestration on their land, and how the impact of this and similar efforts could be strengthened by the existence of a transparent carbon market.",

    "content": "Roughly one in three children do not have access to formal child care. But why? Can parents not afford it? Is there not a slot available? Is the child care center too far away? Or do some parents not want to use a formal child care setting—a center or in-home based care? BPC partnered with Morning Consult to learn more about parents who are using informal child care, for example those using relatives, parents alternating work schedules, a non live-in nanny, or other friends and neighbors to care for their young children. Our nation’s child care system is broken. Our survey found 93% of parents are satisfied with their informal child care arrangement, but more than half of parents would still prefer informal child care, even if formal care was free and convenient. Identifying the correct inflection point to balance supply and demand has so far proven impossible. The exact demand for formal child care is unknown, since one third of parents use, and many prefer informal child care for their children. Understanding barriers and the issues keeping parents out of the formal child care system is critical to developing a system that works for child care businesses and families. A summary of survey findings, from the scope of informal care arrangements to the implications of parents’ work schedules on child care needs, are highlighted below. Current Primary Child Care Arrangements: Parents who rely on informal child care entrust a variety of individuals with child care. Two-thirds parents (68%) are using parent-provided care as their primary child care arrangement for their youngest child. A quarter of parents (25%) use relatives as their primary child care and among those who use relative care, 80% rely on grandparents. Only 4% of parents rely on a non-relative friend or neighbor for their primary child care arrangement. Reasons for Informal Child Care: Many parents cite TRUST AND SAFETY as major factors in their decision-making. In addition, parents who choose informal child care do so for various reasons, including cost, quality of care, and having multiple children in care. FLEXIBILITY in hours of care is also a large consideration for parents, especially for service and retail workers. Parents also indicated that COVID concerns were a significant factor in child care choices. A quarter (28%) of parents report knowing their work schedule two weeks in advance or less, with 45% of service workers knowing their work schedule two weeks in advance or less. 79% of parents say that having more than one child aged 0-5 influences their child care arrangement. Most parents cite safety (96%) and trust (95%) as the most important aspects of their informal care arrangement. Parents cite needing care during non-traditional hours, with a quarter (26%) of parents needing child care on the weekends, and 23% of parents needing child care outside of traditional work hours. Of parents who need child care outside of traditional work hours, 81% need care from 6 to 8p.m. Barriers to Formal Child Care: While a vast majority&hellip;",

    "content": "The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA) (P.L. 117-159) that President Biden signed on June 25 is one of the largest stand-alone mental health funding bills in recent history—and the President and Congress deserve great credit in bringing it to fruition. With reported incidences of mental health and substance use disorder higher than ever, however, there are more options for closing the access gap between those who desperately need behavioral health care services and those who can provide it. Before COVID-19, nearly one in five adults suffered with a mental illness at any given time, statistics show. During the pandemic, this figure jumped to about 40%, the Kaiser Family Foundation found. Unfortunately, more than half of those with mental illness remain untreated, and studies found the percentage is even higher among those struggling with substance use disorder. At the same time, and for those without challenges in access to care, many options for the treatment of mental illness and substance use disorder exist. These options include talk therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and medications for opioid use disorder. Dr. Thomas Insel, former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, says that when it comes to mental illness, we have a “crisis of care”—and the solutions are not just medical but social and political as well. In tackling the social challenge to addressing behavioral health (essentially, the stigma associated with it), the nation has made great strides. Policymakers now must address the political challenge, which is to gather the necessary support from policymakers to enact comprehensive mental health legislation that will give millions more people access to the care they need. To be sure, policymakers made great progress in enacting the BSCA. It provided $800 million for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for programs that expand access to services, thereby helping to close the access gap. Of this money, $150 million is going to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline—which is now the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline—to increase call center capacity. These dollars are essential because, with a new, easy-to-remember number, calls to the Lifeline are expected to more than double over the next year. This new number also offers an unprecedented opportunity to connect Americans to the behavioral health care services they need and, thus, an opportunity to further close the access gap. Nevertheless, and as outlined in our June 2022 report, Answering the Call—988: A New Vision for Crisis Response, the Lifeline suffers from a lack of sustained, authorized appropriations. That is why we recommend that the administration (i.e., SAMHSA) and Congress continue to evaluate the Lifeline’s utilization needs to determine its appropriate ongoing funding. BPC also recommends that SAMHSA establish a scorecard to assess crisis system performance so that program managers can evaluate the extent to which states are implementing their 988 programs and can track progress over time. Furthermore, the availability and reliability of 988 services beyond call centers—including mobile crisis response&hellip;",

    "content": "As the federal student debt portfolio continues to balloon, the federal government must consider stronger accountability mechanisms to protect students from low-value institutions and unsustainable debt. The Bipartisan Policy Center has a newly updated tool that allows users to search for the return on investment (ROI) for colleges and universities across the country.. BPC’s modeling reaffirms that not all higher education institutions provide a positive return for students. Previous estimates have suggested that a bachelor’s degree, on average, leads to approximately $1.2 million in additional lifetime earnings, but BPC’s analysis shows that a fuller accounting of costs results in a different assessment for many institutions. The Department of Education disburses nearly $150 billion in financial aid annually to thousands of institutions across the country, and many students and their families may assume that these institutions meet quality standards. However, inadequate accountability standards mean low-performing institutions are rarely disqualified from receiving federal funds, allowing those schools to saddle students with debt yet provide no real benefit after enrollment. In February, the Department of Education updated the institution-level College Scorecard data on which BPC’s modeling was based; the new data are now reflected in the model. The updated findings are generally consistent with previous findings: most (85%) higher education institutions (with long-term earnings data in the College Scorecard) show a positive ROI for their median student. Public institutions (96%) are the most likely to provide a positive median ROI while private for-profit institutions (44%) are the least likely; for-profit institutions that predominantly award undergraduate certificates are the least likely to have a positive median ROI of any category of institution and make up more than half of all institutions whose median student had a negative ROI. Updated model results can be searched and downloaded on the main report page. Understanding college ROI can not only be valuable to prospective students and their families, but in theory, it could also help Congress better target student aid and reduce future student debt. Although BPC modeling relies on quality data sources, there are still limitations to the available data that may need to be addressed prior to policy application. The federal government is currently forbidden by law to record and analyze data at the individual student level, which limits the precision with which researchers and the Department of Education can assess the value of college across institutions, programs, and demographics. Congressional action would be required to allow the federal government to record and analyze student-level data, but enhanced data sharing between government agencies like the Census Bureau, IRS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Social Security Administration would be a good starting point for shedding further light on long-term workforce outcomes for students and the value that institutions provide. Improved data on student outcomes, however, cannot fully protect students without action on regulation. Policymakers cannot afford to wait for further data availability before moving toward greater accountability for institutions, whether through stricter eligibility requirements for disbursing federal student aid, a performance-based premium or fee&hellip;",

    "content": "Technology platforms are now a major component of how Americans experience campaigns and elections. Yet a role that seems ubiquitous today has changed dramatically in the last 20 years. Those changes in the past may presage what to expect in the future – and policymakers around the world have a lot to consider. In the early days of social media — from MySpace, Friendster, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter — candidates were apprehensive about using online tools for voter outreach. That did not stop many companies from actively courting candidates to use their platforms; the companies were also quick to promote how they were being used for political and civic communications. The companies soon added additional features intended to promote civic engagement. They built tools to help Americans register to vote and to simply identify where they could cast a ballot on Election Day. Some companies even sponsored debates and hosted government officials on their campuses. Much of the elections-focused work, though, shifted towards integrity efforts after the 2016 election when misinformation and foreign interference became household terms. Technology companies started to launch products and policies to bring more transparency to online advertising, fight abuse, combat mis- and disinformation, increase digital literacy, and work with partners around the globe to help identify other ways their platforms might be abused and harm the democratic process. They also continued to build out tools to boost authoritative information about the election process. The Bipartisan Policy Center, in partnership with the Integrity Institute, now hosts the filterable Technology Platforms Election Database, which contains information from nearly 50 companies about their work on elections across the globe over the past 20 years. The data goes back to 2003 and will continuously be updated. Every entry has a column for the date it was added. Our hope is that the database can be used to study tech companies&#8217; efforts around elections in pursuit of workable products, policies, and partnerships for future challenges to come. You can access the database here. Our intention is to continually update this database and add additional fields over time such as specific keywords and topics that each link covers. Later this fall, we will also release an analysis of how the various companies’ work has evolved in this space. If you see any information that is missing or incorrect, please contact us at kharbath@bipartisanpolicy.org or cfernekes@bipartisanpolicy.org Note: some fields such as dates might be empty if that specific information was not provided in the source",

    "content": "Clichés exist for a reason, and the classic “everything’s bigger in Texas” certainly holds true for the state’s goliath 23rd Congressional District, represented by Republican Tony Gonzales. Democratic Representative Darren Soto experienced this firsthand as he traversed many miles of southwest Texas, even as the asphalt under his wheels only connected a small portion of what is the second largest congressional district that is not an entire state (e.g., Wyoming, South Dakota, and a handful of others). Rep. Soto was in the Lone Star State returning the favor for Rep. Gonzales’s visit to Rep. Soto’s central Florida district in April, organized under BPC’s American Congressional Exchange program. Beginning in San Antonio, the famous River Walk and historic metropolitan area quickly gave way to rolling hills with dry scrubby landscapes, and towns and ranches that are few and far between. Rep. Soto had the opportunity to see how these Texans live in these rugged conditions, in contrast to the more tightly concentrated urban and suburban areas near Orlando that form most of his district. And yet, the trip underscored common experiences and interests. Rep. Soto also represents Florida agricultural lands, including cattle farms. In Texas, he had the opportunity to visit a ranch where farmers shared concerns that echo those in Florida, particularly with respect to an adequate workforce. He and Rep. Gonzales heard about issues with agricultural work visas (so-called H-2A’s) that unquestionably impact both red and blue districts and states. The ranchers also emphasized the importance of enforcement and reduced bureaucracy for legal, work-related immigration. In a related vein, both members toured the U.S.-Mexico border crossing at the Rio Grande River in Del Rio, TX, hosted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. In the immigration arena, specifics differ between central Florida and southern Texas, but both members share an interest in providing opportunities for migrants to contribute to America’s economic success while ensuring our nation’s security. On that note, Reps. Soto and Gonzales had a chance to witness Laughlin Air Force Base’s invaluable contributions to pilot training while also experiencing a ceremony commemorating a change of command at this important facility. The day’s capstone was a solemn and profoundly moving stop in Uvalde. The visit’s policy focus was on community recovery and the urgent need for behavioral health resources in the town and beyond. A spectrum of local officials convened for an open and frank conversation on the path toward healing, and specifically the necessity for nearby physical facilities that can meet the mental health needs of the region. At the meeting’s conclusion, both members announced they would lead a bipartisan letter to the Biden administration urging the timely dissemination of mental health grants to Uvalde and other communities around the nation. The most important moments, however, came when both members of Congress paid their respects to the children who lost their lives and the families that were forever changed. They passed by Robb Elementary School, where an astonishing cascade of flowers, stuffed animals, and notes memorializing the lives&hellip;",

    "content": "This week, Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Rob Portman (R-OH) participated in the second of The Senate Project debate series, organized by BPC, the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation, and the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate. The senators discussed issues on which Congress is deeply divided including the economy and inflation, gun control, reproductive rights, and immigration and border security. Their conversation on immigration highlighted openings for bipartisanship including addressing national security needs on the border and the economic growth opportunities that immigration offers. The following are key takeaways from the immigration portion of the debate. Encounter Numbers and Security on the Southern Border: Sen. Portman opened the topic of immigration by discussing the rise in migrant encounters during this fiscal year and the need for further security measures at the southern border. Both senators discussed Title 42, with Sen. Murphy noting that the increase in encounters is in part due to higher levels of recidivism encouraged by the policy. The senators agreed that monitoring the illicit flows of goods and people is a priority for border security. Sen. Portman noted the illicit flow of goods crossing the border including fentanyl, guns, and human smuggling, citing the security risks they pose to the United States and to migrants. Sen. Murphy discussed technological investments at ports of entry, where 90% of illegal goods flow, to combat illicit trades, pointing out investments the Biden administration has made and urging continued investment in border security technology. BPC addresses these exact issues in a May 2021 report on a new border management and security policy framework, focusing on the different components needed to separate and expedite processing of asylum-seeking arrivals from other security activities focused on threats posed by criminals, drugs, and terrorism. Asylum Reform: On the issue of asylum, the senators agreed that the asylum system needs reform. Sen. Portman noted that the current asylum system has a backlog of 1.5 million cases, and Sen. Murphy remarked on recent measures by the Biden administration to address that backlog. Both senators said that the current system often causes migrants to take dangerous routes to the border, such as those through the Sonora desert, or rely on human smugglers to get to the U.S. and Mexico border. Sen. Portman remarked that the current system is not humane, with Sen. Murphy agreeing and underscoring that the two parties need to work together on asylum reform. As BPC points out in a 2019 analysis, the current system leaves us woefully unprepared to manage large humanitarian flows. Legal Immigration Reform: Both senators noted that immigrants are critical to the economic growth of the U.S. Sen. Murphy noted that America relies on immigrants, with Sen. Portman agreeing that there needs to be expansions in the legal immigration system. The senators discussed bipartisan efforts to expand visa access, address the backlog of STEM Ph.D.s, and meet American workforce needs through immigration—all issues which BPC advocates for in our recent report, Immigrant Entrepreneurship: Economic Potential and Obstacles to&hellip;",

    "content": "Hot on the heels of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act being signed into law—a major victory for energy and climate policy — the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) reconciliation package would make significant progress towards America’s mid-century climate goals. While the Bipartisan Policy Center does not support the use of reconciliation to pass major legislation, many of the energy and climate provisions in the IRA have enjoyed bipartisan support and match our previous recommendations. Clean energy provisions in the bill would accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, reduce global emissions, lower energy prices, help export American innovation, strengthen our economy and build a reliable and affordable energy sector. Clean energy tax credits and other provisions included in the bill would increase energy production at home and accelerate energy innovation abroad. Additionally, by investing in disadvantaged communities, prioritizing projects that reutilize retired fossil fuel infrastructure and employ displaced workers, and including incentives for climate-smart agricultural practices, the IRA would make meaningful progress towards a fair, equitable, and economic clean energy transition.  Recent modeling by Rhodium Group highlights the substantial emissions reduction impact of these provisions. Under a business-as-usual scenario, the United States is on track to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by between 24% to 35% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Under the IRA, this would increase to between 31% to 44% by 2030. Figure 1: Data and figure from Rhodium Group  Below, BPC summarizes the key energy and climate provisions included in the IRA. To assist our readers, we also include the following notes and context: Tax credit values throughout this summary assume that facilities or projects satisfy prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and thus receive bonus credits for a total credit value of 5 times the base amount. For the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit, Energy Investment Tax Credit, and new Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC), facilities with maximum net output less than 1 megawatts (MW) are exempt from the labor requirements and receive the bonus automatically. Many of the tax credits included in the legislation allow direct payments to be made in lieu of a reduction in tax liability (&#8220;direct pay&#8221;) and/or an option to monetize the credits by transferring them to an entity with greater tax liability (&#8220;transferability&#8221;). Direct pay is limited to certain tax exempt and governmental entities for most of the eligible tax credits. This limitation does not apply to the first 5 years of the section 45V clean hydrogen credit, section 45Q carbon capture and sequestration credit, and section 45X advanced manufacturing credit. For more on why direct pay is essential, see BPC’s explainer on direct pay. Provisions listed with a superscript are associated with bipartisan legislation. Clean Energy Tax Credits Production Tax Credits New Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V)1 Creates a new 10-year incentive for clean hydrogen production with four tiers and a maximum of 4 kilograms of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per kilogram of hydrogen (H2).

    "content": "BPC developed a survey, in partnership with the Council of State Community Development Agencies, to inform the work of our Disaster Response Reform Task Force and better understand how HUD’s Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program can better support communities as they recover from devastating and deadly disasters. The survey asked CDBG-DR program grantees, including state and local grant managers, to identify key benefits and difficulties associated with the program, as well as their priorities for reform.   Their responses below are particularly timely as the House of Representatives just recently passed CDBG-DR reform legislation—though on a party line vote—in an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. It is unclear whether the Senate will keep the amendment language in the bill as it works to advance the NDAA. Yet there is significant, bipartisan interest in seeing the CDBG-DR program codified and improved. At the end of 2021, both House and Senate committee held hearings on legislation to permanently authorize CDBG-DR, including S. 2471, the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act introduced by Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI), Susan Collins (R-ME), Todd Young (R-IN), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA).  Officials from Puerto Rico, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York City, and Alaska are just a few of the 36 CDBG-DR grantees that completed the survey—representing a diverse range of disaster-related needs. Overall, survey respondents expressed support for HUD&#8217;s role in federal disaster recovery efforts, particularly those focused on housing, but also expressed a distinct need for changes to expedite the recovery process.   Key Takeaways: 94% of survey respondents said CDBG-DR funding was very or somewhat important to their state or community’s recovery. No respondents said it was not at all important. 69% of survey respondents said that housing has been the most important unmet need that CDBG-DR funding has addressed. 86% of survey respondents said it is very or somewhat important for HUD to have an active role in providing disaster assistance. 86% of survey respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that HUD is better suited than FEMA to provide medium- and long-term disaster housing assistance. 39% of survey respondents said that the most significant delays in the CDBG-DR grant process occur from when a disaster strikes to the initial congressional appropriation. “Permanent statutory authorization of the CDBG-DR program” had the strongest support of proposed reforms, with 97% responding that it was very or somewhat important. More standardized program forms and templates had the strongest support of proposed HUD reforms, with 94% responding that it was very or somewhat important (and 70% saying it is very important).",

    "content": "For the second time in its four-year existence, the American Congressional Exchange arrived in the home state of one of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s four founders: South Dakota’s former Senator Tom Daschle. While Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) represents the entire state at-large, this trip focused on the southeastern corner, the I-29 corridor that eventually makes its way north to the Canadian border. Visiting Rep. Johnson from one state over was Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN), who represents the western and southern suburbs of Minneapolis. Rep. Johnson visited Rep. Phillips district in August 2021. In addition to representing their districts as a whole, both representatives serve on multiple committees. Rep. Johnson serves on the House Agriculture Committee and Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee and Rep. Phillips serves on the House Foreign Affairs and Small Business Committees. To start off the trip, the two members visited two communities that are deeply rooted in South Dakota; the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe and the Pleasant Valley Hutterite Colony. While visiting with Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, the members learned about how the tribe provides health and long-term care services to its members. The visit also included a discussion between the members about the economic development of the tribal community and how the community has been accessing U.S. HUD grants to build additional housing. The members then visited with leaders from the Pleasant Valley Colony, a communal German-speaking people who came from Russia in the 1870s. About 25 families live and work together, mainly in agriculture. But now, some of the colony has entered the metals manufacturing field. The two congressmen saw the juxtaposition of traditional farming and modern metallurgical machinery being operated by highly skilled members of the colony. As the trip continued, growth and innovation in South Dakota became a main focus. South Dakota’s population is growing at a fast pace – up 9% since 2010. This is particularly evident in the Sioux Falls metro area, which grew by 48% between 2000-2020 and now stands at 282,000. Driving around the region, one sees the construction of subdivisions with few natural barriers to development. Meeting with Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, the two members heard about some of Sioux Falls’ challenges managing its growth. Recently, the city broke ground on a $215 million expansion of its wastewater treatment plant which will result in a 50% increase in capacity. Mayor TenHaken said infrastructure projects like this will position Sioux Falls and the region for continued development. Much of the trip was also focused on agriculture and new technologies being developed in the state to create greater efficiencies and crop yields. At Raven Industries Innovation Campus in Baltic, the members learned about new autonomous products such as field computers, planter controls, and GPS guidance systems. One highlight: each congressman took a ride on a combine synced with a driverless grain tractor. At Prairie Aquatech in Brookings, Reps. Johnson and Phillips learned about the company’s high protein nutritional ingredients which are used in their state-of-the-art aquaculture research lab for a&hellip;",

    "content": "Thanks to Stranger Things, the number one summer song on Spotify in the United States until last week was Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill.” It’s an apt if unlikely hit—the song was originally released in 1985. Yet it undoubtedly captures the general sentiment among entrepreneurs and small business owners. According to nearly every recent survey, small and young companies still feel like they’re “running up that hill” of economic challenge. Inflation in particular has hit the youngest and smallest businesses quite hard. According to the latest survey from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices, one-third of respondents cited inflation as their most significant problem. That was up from just 22% in April. In the most recent Small Business Index from MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, inflation was cited as the top issue by 44% of small business respondents. And in a survey of new entrepreneurs by Gusto, inflation even beat out “time and attention for business”—a perennial challenge for business owners—as the top issue. Put inflation together with lingering supply chain difficulties, hiring challenges, and persistent financing gaps, and it’s no wonder that small and young companies feel like they’re “running up that hill” and getting nowhere. Gusto and the Bipartisan Policy Center recently hosted a public discussion to explore these challenges and address an apparent juxtaposition. While entrepreneurs and small businesses continue to wrestle with inflation and financing, new business creation has surged at record levels the last two years. More entrepreneurs in the Gusto survey have been starting out of opportunity rather than necessity, an indisputably positive sign. We spoke to Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Rep. Ron Estes (R-KS), and a panel of experts and small business supporters to understand what’s going on—and what policymakers might do to better support them, including through enhancement of the R&amp;D tax credit. Panel participants were: Alyssa Harvey Dawson, Chief Legal Officer, Gusto Corinne Hodges, CEO, Association of Women’s Business Center (AWBC) Joshua Lee, founder, Ardius Ryan Metcalf, Head of US Public Policy &amp; Global Social Impact, Funding Circle Here are some highlights and takeaways from that discussion. Enhancing the R&amp;D Tax Credit A particular point of emphasis for participants was the research and development (R&amp;D) tax credit, intended to support innovative activities at small and young companies. The recently crafted Inflation Reduction Act in the Senate includes an increase in the refundable portion of the credit, something Sen. Hassan has championed.

    "content": "Who are “documented Dreamers?” Documented Dreamers are foreign nationals who entered the United States as dependents under their parents&#8217; temporary, nonimmigrant visa status, usually a work visa. Under U.S. immigration law, at the age of 21, they will “age out” of eligibility for this dependent status. The parents of these “documented Dreamers” may be seeking permanent residency and, while still a dependent under age 21, their children can be included in their application. However, due to existing immigration backlogs, extraordinary wait times, and limits by country of origin to receive a green card, if these young adults do not receive permanent residency by the age of 21, then they lose their temporary dependent status and are removed from the green card queue, thus “aging out” of eligibility. After they age out, many of these previously documented individuals are faced with falling out of legal status and becoming undocumented, finding another temporary visa status of their own, or having to leave the country when their status ends. In April of 2020, there were an estimated 253,293 children awaiting permanent residency based on their parents’ employment-sponsored visas. Many of these children are at risk of aging out. Documented Dreamers have been legally authorized to live in the United States for most of their lives, and many of them have spent little time in their countries of origin, having come to the U.S. with their parents at a very young age. This circumstance makes their situation somewhat analogous to the undocumented “Dreamers” that have been seeking legislation to gain status, thus the name “documented Dreamers” has come into use by and for this group. Documented Dreamers are also seeking legislation that would allow them to keep a legal status they previously held after they turn 21. What are the characteristics of documented Dreamers? Documented Dreamers tend to hold a variety of temporary visas. The most common ones are H-1B, E-1, E- 2, and L-1. The H-1B category allows U.S. employers to petition for foreign professional workers with specific characteristics. The L-1 visa is for intracompany transfers, when an employee is transferred to the United States to work for a U.S. company affiliated with their foreign employer. Dependents of H-1B visa holders come into the United States as H-4 dependents, a temporary status and a nonimmigrant visa. Similarly, dependents of L-1 visa holders have L-2 status. H-4 and L-2 status is valid for the length of the principal worker’s visa or until the child reaches the age of 21. Many children have aged out of their parents’ visas because they have been stuck in the green card queue for many years and the immigration backlog is taking longer than the time these individuals have to adjust their status before they age out. Dependents of E-1 or E-2 visa holders rarely have the ability to apply for green cards; the parental status is indefinitely extendable but has no clear path to permanent residence. If they have children, their children age out of dependent status at&hellip;",

    "content": "All-star NBA basketball player Michael Jordan once said: “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” If he missed so often, why did he keep getting to take those shots? To win, you have to make baskets and in order to make them, you have to shoot the ball. No risk, no reward. That’s where our nation is on climate change: the greatest risk is if our nation does nothing. If our nation won’t take shots, the American people lose. What does basketball have to do with clean energy? Last year, the Department of Energy was tasked with distributing an unprecedented level of funding for major energy projects that will require new ways of thinking about how our government invests in promising but unproven technologies. In the enormous spending package that was the Infrastructure Jobs and Investment Act (IIJA) of 2021, Congress handed DOE a set of groundbreaking new tools to transform America’s approach to scaling up energy technologies. A key element of this toolset is the new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), which received $21 billion from Congress on a bipartisan basis to overcome one of the most challenging obstacles facing advanced energy innovations: commercial demonstration. Energy experts have long recognized the important role commercial-scale demonstration plays in the journey from idea to mass deployment. Because solutions to the many daunting challenges in demonstration projects are neither easy nor cheap, this stage is often called the “valley of death.” Given high costs and risks, private companies can’t support large-scale demonstration projects independently. OCED has a critical supporting role in bridging this valley of death—but to do so, it must lean into its mission to drive innovation. Risk must be managed, but not eliminated or avoided. At the same time—to support OCED—Americans will have to cultivate an appreciation for innovative risk-taking to meet our climate goals, just as we did when navigating the Space Race with the former Soviet Union. Importantly, we should avoid drawing the wrong lessons from past experiences. Case in point is the story of Solyndra, a now infamous company that had an outsized role in shaping public perceptions about the government’s role in financing big energy projects. Solyndra was a solar manufacturing company that filed for bankruptcy in 2011, just two years after being awarded a $535 million loan guarantee from the DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO). When the company failed to repay the loan, the incident made national headlines, the press grilled then-President Barack Obama, and Congress held probing oversight hearings, demanding answers from then-Energy Secretary Steven Chu on how DOE could have let this happen. Overall, the investment was painted as a huge embarrassment for the Obama administration and became a deeply impactful setback for the mission of DOE. Policymakers learned the wrong lesson from Solyndra: fear of&hellip;",

    "content": "From 1999 to 2020, opioid overdose deaths claimed the lives of over half a million Americans, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid-involved deaths continue to increase each year, with 2021 marking the first time the U.S. surpassed 100,000 related deaths in a single year. While federal and state governments in the U.S. have taken steps to combat the issue, public opinion remains a key element in addressing the crisis. A BPC-Morning Consult poll conducted in May aims to give a clearer understanding of the public’s views on the misuse of opioids in the United States. While revealing that a majority of American adults consider the opioid crisis a major problem in the country, the poll also looks at the personal impact of opioid addiction and how Americans feel about Congress’ response to the opioid crisis. Major Takeaways Sixty-one percent of Americans consider the misuse of opioids in the U.S. to be a major public health emergency, a belief held by a majority of people from each political party: 66% of Democrats, 58% of Republicans, and 57% of independents. Another 21% of adults consider the misuse of opioids in the U.S. to be a minor public health emergency. Did You Know? Though partially overshadowed by the attention given to the COVID-19 pandemic, drug overdose mortality rates have risen approximately 30% since 2019, and the U.S. surpassed 100,000 deaths in a 12-month period during 2021. While discussing the crisis in terms of related deaths is the best way to appreciate the scope of the opioid epidemic, a lag in data means that we don’t fully understand the crisis’ impact until 6 to 18 months after the fact. American adults are more likely to think the opioid crisis is a major problem in the U.S. (68%) than in their own state (53%) or even their community (36%). Did You Know? A Pew survey from May 2022 found that public concern about addiction is down, even in areas of the U.S. where drug overdose death rates have increased the most. When comparing the treated prevalence—or the number of people being treated for a given disease—for opioid use disorders between patients in Medicaid expansion vs. non-expansion states, BPC found that there are about 2 to 3 times more people in treatment in expansion states. An adult who is from a low-income or minority community is less likely to say the opioid crisis is a major problem in those communities than adults who are not. Did You Know? The demographics among those with the highest drug overdose mortality are shifting from white Americans in the Northeast: mortality has increased by 81% among both Black Americans and Native Americans, and by 67% in the West since 2019. About one-third of Americans think it would be difficult to find convenient (29%), effective (31%), or affordable (36%) care for opioid addiction. Did You Know?

There is growing consensus among the scientific community that carbon dioxide removal strategies, including direct air capture (DAC), are an important component for achieving our climate goals. On June 22, 2022, the Bipartisan Policy Center, in partnership with BPC’s DAC Advisory Council, brought together representatives from the Department of Energy and the broader DAC community to discuss the opportunities that DAC presents as a technology, including uncertainties about the implementation of DAC Hubs from last year’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. The event began with an opening keynote from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a leader on environmental issues in the Senate. He spoke about the necessity for deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to meet climate goals and advocated for procurement legislation that can spur early markets for CDR, including his recently introduced Federal Carbon Dioxide Removal Leadership Act. After the opening keynote, the first panel featured Noah Deich, Acting Director of CDR and CO2 Conversion at DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, and Brad Markell, Executive Director of the Industrial Union Council, AFL-CIO. Both speakers reflected on the tremendous progress that DAC has made as a technology base over the past 10 years—moving from thought experiment to thousands of tons of removal capacity being piloted today—and how carbon management is a requisite component of meeting our climate goals. They also discussed the job creation potential that DAC and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law present and how the DAC Hubs can facilitate a “just transition” for blue-collar workers from the fossil fuel industry. The second panel focused squarely on some of the hard questions facing the implementation of DAC Hubs. The panel featured Kelly Cummins, the Acting Director of DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Shuchi Talati, a Senior Visiting Scholar at Carbon 180, and Marcius Extavour, the Vice President for Energy &amp; Climate at XPRIZE. The panel discussed the need to balance innovation with immediate scale-up at the hubs by pairing realistic risk expectations with support for technological diversity. They also discussed the importance of performing meaningful community engagement throughout the life of the hub projects. The third panel, “Business Models and Financing Challenges,” was moderated by former Rep. John Delaney and featured Jigar Shah, the Director of DOE’s Loan Program Office, along with Nan Ransohoff, the Head of Climate at Stripe, and Jay Dessy, a Director at Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. The speakers discussed the business opportunities and challenges associated with DAC deployment and the leadership role that the private sector has played in driving additional investments over the past year. There was a consensus that much more needs to be done and that, with additional policy signals and investments, there are tremendous environmental and business opportunities to be had from the Hubs.

    "content": "Manufactured housing is an important, yet often overlooked, affordable housing option. These homes are factory built, placed on a permanent chassis, and delivered to a housing site. Manufactured housing is less expensive and faster to build than onsite, stick-built homes, offering an opportunity to quickly increase much-needed housing supply. However, regulatory, financial, and cultural barriers prevent significant investment in and expansion of manufactured housing options. Adopting regulatory policies that encourage the production of more manufactured homes and allow for cheaper and better financing would increase access to this affordable housing option. Background The design and production of manufactured homes has evolved over time. Their quality can equal that of stick-built homes, while costing, on average, 40% to 50% less to produce. Manufactured homes are built to meet a single national U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) standard—or HUD Code—based on the National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. HUD routinely updates the standard to enhance quality, safety, and energy efficiency. Manufactured homes can now be produced to mimic stick-built homes with pitched roofs, garages, and decks. For many years, manufactured housing represented 15% to 25% of the new homes produced annually. The sector reached peak production in 1996, when manufactured homes represented 25% of new homes. Since that time, all new manufactured housing as a share of the market has declined significantly. Currently, manufactured housing represents about 10% of all new homes constructed and about 7.5% of existing homes—providing housing for approximately 20 million Americans. The question arises: With the U.S. facing an acute shortage of affordable homes, what is preventing the manufactured housing sector from reaching its full potential as a source of affordable housing supply? Primary Challenges Freddie Mac, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Urban Institute have all recently released reports examining the opportunities and challenges facing the manufactured housing sector. Among the most significant barriers to increasing the supply of manufactured housing cited are land-use restrictions and the lack of available, affordable financing. 1. Land-Use Restrictions Many communities have zoning and land-use policies that prevent manufactured homes from being sited in all but a few locations—either explicitly banning them or by instituting policies like minimum lot sizes that make manufacturing homes more costly and difficult to site. The Manufactured Housing Institute notes that many communities have, or are actively considering, mandates that manufactured homes be placed on lots of 1 to 10 acres, or more. By requiring more land to be acquired, sometimes far in excess of a manufactured home’s value, minimum lot sizes can precipitously increase the cost of manufactured homes, make them less affordable and viable, and limit the amount of land overall that is available and suitable for new homes. Given the rising cost of land, existing owners of manufactured housing communities are also increasingly selling these properties for redevelopment. The high price of land further reduces the value proposition of manufactured homes vis-à-vis stick-built homes. Regulatory limits on manufactured homes also include outright bans, including some&hellip;",

    "content": "In a recent event, “New Investments in Clean, Equitable, Affordable Energy and Transportation,” BPC hosted three industry experts for a panel that included discussion of challenges to implementing charging infrastructure and leveraging the $7.5 billion that will be provided through Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act grants. Panelists included: Karen Wayland &#8211; Chief Executive Officer, The GridWise Alliance Phil Jones &#8211; Executive Director, The Alliance for Transportation Electrification David Strickland &#8211; Vice President of Global Regulatory Affairs, General Motors Here are three key takeaways from the panelists’ discussion on building out EV charging infrastructure. 1. Utilities may not yet be fully prepared to handle increased EV charging. A substantial increase in demand for electricity, due to EV charging, may strain an unprepared grid system, according to Strickland and Wayland. Wayland explained that the grid will be able to absorb increased electricity use in the long run, but there will be challenges in the utility industry in the short run. Utilities often have to navigate cumbersome regulatory and engineering processes to adapt to changing electricity use—unlike EV consumers who can simply buy new cars overnight. Wayland added that smaller utilities may not have the inhouse expertise or experience required to navigate federal funding opportunities. If smaller utilities are not able to receive grid modernization funding, their customers will be left without the backbone infrastructure required to support a transition to electric vehicles. However, Wayland was hopeful federal funding for grid improvements provided in the IIJA could help utilities meet the increased electricity demand and that, over time and through technological advancements and grid modernization, a massive fleet of EVs could transmit unused power from EV batteries back into the grid. Wayland’s organization, the Gridwise Alliance, recently released a report on the near-term grid investments needed to accommodate EV adoption. 2. Residents of apartment buildings face barriers to EV charging access. Most EV drivers can charge overnight and leave the house with a fully charged vehicle every day—the most convenient way to regularly charge. However, residents of apartment and condo buildings are less likely to have a dedicated spot to charge their EV, as Jones pointed out. In cities ranging from Baltimore to Los Angeles, large swaths of the population live in multifamily units while still driving regularly. Many homeowners’ associations also put restrictions on chargers, Jones noted. Fortunately, the $2.5 billion competitive EV charging grant in the IIJA is intended to prioritize chargers for multifamily housing. Jones put forth a few additional policy solutions to bring chargers to residents of multifamily units. For example, Jones highlighted that Washington state passed a bill preventing HOAs from restricting chargers. Jones also said that building codes could require a certain percentage of parking spaces to be capable of charging EVs, as Chicago has done. 3. Our national EV charging system requires more investment than the IIJA provides. To reach net-zero by 2050, the U.S. will need to utilize demand-side incentives to accelerate the deployment of EVs in the coming decades, such as EV tax credits&hellip;",

    "content": "As the internet has matured, digital platforms (such as app stores) have grown to play a critical role in commerce. The platforms’ decisions on how to structure and govern themselves can have serious implications for external parties (such as users and third-party apps), impacting competition, choice, privacy, and security. This blog will explore issues of platform openness for digital platforms to better understand what they mean for users and the policy implications that accompany them. Platform Openness and Gatekeeping A critical decision that digital platforms make is their degree of openness. Platform openness is a measure of how much a platform places restrictions on external parties. For instance, an app store that restricts itself to only a few select third-party app makers is less open than one that allows anyone to make apps for it. By deciding what products to allow on a digital platform, a platform owner influences the number and type of options consumers have access to. Open platforms can foster more choice and competition on a platform, but they can also limit a platform’s ability to place restrictions for the purposes of protecting privacy, security, or content moderation. The appropriate level of platform openness varies for consumers depending on their personal preferences. For instance, one consumer might want to dramatically limit the number of applications on their device due to security concerns, while another might want more choice of applications and a less strict screening process. Platforms with differing levels of openness compete with each other in the broader marketplace and the level of competition can affect the likelihood of anticompetitive behavior. The level of competition and anticompetitive behavior in a sector can be difficult to decipher. In a competitive market, the number of platforms and their degree of openness can vary based on different consumer preferences. Competition resulting from these differences can serve as a deterrent to anticompetitive behavior, since users and third parties can more easily switch away from a platform that abuses its gatekeeping powers. With a handful of key platforms involved in a large share of the functions performed on the modern internet, fierce debate exists over the competitiveness of the markets they are in, their level of market power, and whether they are abusing it for anticompetitive purposes. Advocates of stricter regulation say that these digital platforms possess considerable market power because of their large user base and that those operating more closed systems can more easily abuse third parties operating on the platform by placing anticompetitive restrictions on them. Spotify has criticized app store policies and alleged Apple has acted in an anticompetitive manner with their gatekeeping power and the 30% fee they charge apps like theirs, particularly given their operation of a direct competitor, Apple Music. Apple disputes this characterization and argues that “Spotify wouldn’t be the business they are today without the App Store ecosystem, but now they’re leveraging their scale to avoid contributing to maintaining that ecosystem for the next generation of app entrepreneurs.” Closed platforms can use&hellip;",

This preference has increased among all voters by 9% since April. A strong majority of voters think it is important that Congress works together to pass economic legislation (91%) while most Americans – currently polling at 70% – had to reduce their household spending over the past month due to increasing gas and grocery prices. More than half of voters (56%) want bipartisan work on economic issues, though more prefer that Republicans work on economic policy (22%) than Democrats (15%). Additionally, voters think it is important for Congress to work across the aisle on health care (90%), criminal justice (87%) and infrastructure (85%) legislation. While voters want to see bipartisan legislation, the poll found that a plurality of voters&#8217; grade President Biden and Congress a D or F on bipartisanship. The poll also reveals that 77% of voters say they will accept the results of the upcoming midterm elections regardless of the outcome. This percentage varies by political party as 87% of Democrats, 73% of Independents, and 71% of Republicans said they share this sentiment. Methodology The poll was conducted by Morning Consult for BPC between June 29 and July 1, 2022, among a sample of 2,005 registered voters. The interviews were conducted online, and the data were weighted to approximate a target sample or registered voters based on gender by age, educational attainment, race, marital status, home ownership, race by educational attainment, 2020 presidential vote, and region.

    "content": "At the end of September, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs will expire. Bipartisan agreement on their reauthorization remains uncertain. Let’s first address the most basic question: should the SBIR/STTR programs be reauthorized? Without a doubt, yes. There is, and has historically been, strong bipartisan agreement regarding the economic value of SBIR/STTR as well as their utility in helping federal agencies access new technologies. Some agencies tell us they are already slowing or postponing their review and award processes due to political uncertainty. It’s likely that many small businesses have simply declined to apply for an award for the same reason. A key obstacle to reauthorization is how to address multiple award winners (MAWs). Some argue MAWs create public and private value. Others believe some fraction of MAWs are “mills” that add little economically. Thus, the question at hand: should reauthorization of SBIR/STTR include limits on multiple award winners? Yes | SBIR MAWs waste taxpayer dollars without generating private sector returns and restrict opportunities for new entrants and innovations. Those who celebrate the economic impact of SBIR/STTR often refer to it as “America’s Seed Fund.” That’s even the trademarked tagline on the program’s website. By definition, a “seed fund” is something that provides initial financial support to get an idea off the ground. (There’s a reason for the botanical analogy: subsequent growth should require other resources, not more “seeds.”) However, if a single firm receives 150 SBIR awards worth tens of millions of dollars and generates zero revenue from non-SBIR sources, shouldn’t it be cut off at some point or risk being merely a taxpayer-subsidized entity? This example is not hyperbolic. There are scores of SBIR mills that win award after award—hundreds in some cases. Many generate little (sometimes zero) revenue from either private-sector sales or other public sources such as government procurement. At NASA, the Energy Department, and Defense Department, for example, only “about one-quarter of their Phase II awards to companies with no prior awards.” Persistent dominance by MAWs is a barrier to new entrants who might bring innovations and fresh thinking to federal agencies and the marketplace. A very similar situation can be found in federal procurement, where small business participation has fallen precipitously. From 2010 to 2019, the number of small businesses providing common products and services to the federal government shrank by 39%. Worse, the number of new small business entrants into the federal procurement marketplace fell by 79% over that same period. This has contributed to a growing concern in the national security community over the erosion of the defense industrial base. The same concerns apply regarding SBIR: having too few businesses meeting the Defense Department’s innovation needs weakens national security. Private conversations with companies that have won multiple SBIR awards are illuminating in this respect. When potential changes that would attract new entrants—such as simplified application procedures or dedicated on-ramps—are proposed, incumbent companies express stern opposition. This is a classic case of pulling up&hellip;",

    "content": "Following recessions, states often respond to financial shortfalls by curtailing unemployment insurance (UI) benefits while failing to carry through on the automatic tax increases built into the system that would help prepare for the next economic downturn. The predictable result is a vicious cycle in which state action erodes the UI system’s ability to accomplish its goals of supporting households and providing a timely infusion of cash into the economy. This has already begun in the aftermath of the COVID-19 recession, with states such as Iowa and Kentucky reducing the maximum duration of UI benefits, weakening the UI system’s ability to respond effectively to the next economic downturn even as the chances of a recession in the near future continue to rise. Recessions Deplete UI Trust Funds, But States Don’t Save Enough in Good Economic Times During economic downturns, high unemployment forces states to pay dramatically higher amounts in UI benefits, depleting their unemployment trust fund accounts. When those accounts run dry, states borrow money from the federal government to cover their UI commitments. However, these loans must be paid back during the following economic recovery, and states are expected to replenish UI trust funds before the next economic crisis. If a state has an outstanding loan balance on January 1 for two consecutive years and does not repay the full amount of its loans by November 10 of the second year, the effective federal unemployment tax rate faced by employers in that state increases automatically by 0.3% each year, from 0.6% up to 6%, until the loan is fully repaid. (In the figure below, this tax revenue is denoted “Automatic debt repayments.” See How Is the Unemployment Insurance Program Financed? for details on the UI trust fund accounts.) The federal government enacted UI with the expectation—but not the requirement—that states would also levy higher state unemployment taxes to rebuild their UI trust fund accounts when the economy is strong. Each state has the policy framework in place to achieve this goal, with triggers for higher tax rates once reserves drop below certain levels, but many legislatures sidestep these tax increases and instead cut benefits. As a result, state trust fund accounts are chronically underfunded and unprepared for unemployment spikes. The Department of Labor defines minimum adequate solvency as reserves sufficient to pay out benefits for one year at the “high&#8211;cost rate,” equal to the average cost from the three highest-cost years of the past 20 years. (This level of solvency is considered a “high&#8211;cost multiple” of one.) As of January 1, 2022, only 16 states meet that threshold; the national average has not met that minimum standard since 1990.  During the Great Recession, at least 35 states borrowed money from the federal government after exhausting their unemployment trust fund accounts, accumulating net trust fund debt of $31 billion (and reducing their high-cost multiple to zero). As the economy improved and the two-year moratorium on loan interest expired, many states opted to reduce recipient benefits rather than increase employer taxes.&hellip;",

These devices, able to communicate with each other and the world around them, open the door to exciting new possibilities for convenience, efficiency, and safety. However, the growing ubiquity of smart home devices also has important implications for privacy and cybersecurity. This blog will explore the technological developments, market dynamics, and cybersecurity issues that inform policy considerations for the smart home industry. The Internet of Things and the Smart Home Industry Today Smart homes are houses or apartments that are equipped with devices that can communicate across a network. These can include Internet-enabled lights, cameras, locks, appliances, and speakers. When combined, these devices allow for new possibilities for efficiency and convenience resulting from automation. For example, smart homes could help consumers save energy by automatically reducing thermostat temperatures while members of the household are away. This is accomplished using WiFi communication with a household member’s smartphone and GPS data to identify when they are away from the home. Alternatively, upon detection of smoke, a smart smoke detector could automatically alert the fire department and send a notification to a household member’s phone if they are away. These smart devices are part of the broader category of the internet of things (IoT). These devices are physical objects that contain sensors and processing power that can connect with other devices and share data. Beyond applications in the home, other IoT devices include internet-connected cars, smart glucose monitors, or Bluetooth-enabled trackers like Apple AirTags. With a wider range of devices becoming available and steady downward trends in price, mainstream adoption of smart home devices in the near future is projected to be highly profitable and common. Forecasts have the global smart home industry grow from $88.4 billion in 2020 to $172 billion by 2026 as more households begin to adopt various technologies. Many consumers are familiar with low-cost, accessible smart speakers like Amazon Echo or Google Home, but the adoption of other smart devices like lights and sensors has occurred at a slower pace due to prohibitive costs and difficult-to-use interfaces. With these products becoming more accessible, this broader range of smart devices may see widespread adoption. Cybersecurity and Privacy Implications For all their promise of increasing efficiency and convenience, smart homes also introduce new risks with the data and information that they produce. With smart devices ranging from thermostats to ovens to toothbrushes, data from a fully connected household is immensely powerful. If this seemingly innocuous data is combined with other sources like browsing and purchase history, whoever possesses such personally identifiable information (PII) data may be able to infer sensitive information like health status, lifestyle, and financial situation from the user. Further, the data could be employed for uses far beyond simple product recommendations or optimization. Recently, health insurance companies have intensified efforts to purchase and collect user data in an effort to further tailor insurance&hellip;",

Campus Happenings GW Defends Thomas Appointment Amid Calls for Removal from Law School Lauren Lumpkin | The Washington Post | July 1, 2022 George Washington University refused calls to dismiss Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas from the faculty in the wake of his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Responding to a petition signed by students and others off-campus, the school asserted it would not dismiss Thomas “because we steadfastly support the robust exchange of ideas and deliberation.” Judge Rescinds No-contact Order Against UI Law Students Anthony Kuipers | The Moscow-Pullman Daily News | July 6, 2022 A federal court ordered the University of Idaho to revoke no-contact orders issued under its Title IX and Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Policies against three law students and a professor, who are, respectively, members of and faculty advisor to the campus’ Christian Legal Society chapter. The orders had been issued after a complaint about the club’s views on marriage. The judge found that this case is not encompassed by Title IX, that there was “almost no due process,” and that the university likely violated the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. Federal and State Civic Secures Democracy Act U.S. Senate | June 13, 2022 The Civic Secures Democracy Act would reauthorize and fund a civics grant program promoting “values such as appreciation for free speech, civil discourse, tolerance and inclusion, and understanding perspectives that differ from one’s own.” The bill would authorize $150 million annually for academic programs and centers, as well as teacher preparation programs. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), the bill’s co-sponsors, spoke about this legislation at the December 2020 launch of BPC’s Campus Free Expression Task Force. Community College Board Relents on Search After Youngkin Threatens to Replace Members Eric Kolenich | Richmond Times-Dispatch | June 29, 2022 The Virginia Community College System board of trustees acceded to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R-VA) demand to include a member of his administration on the search committee for a new chancellor of the 23-campus community college system, after Gov. Youngkin sent members a letter on June 17 asking them to resign if they did not agree to this demand.

    "content": "With the White House hosting a conference on hunger, nutrition, and health in September and Congress expected to renew nutrition programs as part of the Farm Bill in 2023, BPC’s Food and Nutrition Security Task Force plans to develop recommendations for how policymakers can strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps. COVID-19 and the negative economic impacts that resulted showcased SNAP’s importance to tens of millions of families. With businesses closing and millions of workers losing their jobs, many turned to SNAP, the nation’s most effective anti-hunger program, to help them put food on the table. SNAP’s caseload swelled while 10.5% of households were “food insecure,” meaning that they were not always sure where their next meal was coming from. Since March 2020, many families have found themselves navigating SNAP benefits and visiting local food banks for the first time to try to reduce food insecurity in their household. As a result of the flexibilities and increases in benefits provided through SNAP and other federal feeding programs, the percentage of Americans who were food insecure did not increase between 2019 and 2020. In 2021, the federal government expended nearly $114 billion on SNAP to serve over 41 million people. Even now, as COVID-19 is receding, SNAP continues to serve millions of Americans during their time of need. The Farm Bill is a vehicle for one of the largest federal allocations of food and nutrition-related funding. For the 2018 Farm Bill, BPC convened a diverse bipartisan task force to develop a robust set of recommendations for strengthening nutrition in SNAP. The Task Force called for strengthening SNAP to improve dietary quality, funding programs to incentivize fruit and vegetable purchasing, strengthening SNAP retailer standards, improving education programs, and exploring further pilot programs. In 2021, BPC assembled its 18-member bipartisan Food and Nutrition Security Task Force, with diverse expertise from both the public and private sectors. Through three reports, the task force aims to “assess both legislative and administrative policy opportunities and issue recommendations that will: 1) improve food and nutrition security during COVID-19 and the economic recovery, 2) strengthen the Child Nutrition Programs through the Child Nutrition Reauthorization, and 3) enhance the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other food assistance programs, including through the Farm Bill.” The first report, Improving Food and Nutrition Security During COVID-19, the Economic Recovery, and Beyond, from September 2021, highlighted impacts of COVID-19 on food and nutrition insecurity and proposed federal nutrition policy options to continue supporting adults and children through the pandemic and beyond. The second report, Strengthening the Child Nutrition Programs, from February 2022, further examined food and nutrition insecurity among children and adolescents and discussed how to improve food security and health outcomes through programs like the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and others. The task force’s final report, which it plans to issue this fall, will provide detailed recommendations on how to&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress has tried and failed to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation for over 20 years. The American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) is the latest attempt by Congress to introduce and enact federal privacy protections. The agreement was reached by Sen. Commerce Committee Ranking Member Roger Wicker (R-MS) and House Energy and Commerce Chair and Ranking Member, Reps. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-WA). Importantly, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, has her own privacy bill and opposes several provisions of the compromise proposal. We were able to read Sen. Cantwell’s draft, which is widely circulating around the Hill. The draft is an updated version of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA), which was first introduced in 2019. Privacy The right to privacy has often been called the “right to be left alone,” but it is now far more than just that. Privacy can include revealing secrets to close friends or not having unwanted inquiries into your personal life. Privacy is also about protecting personally identifiable information (PII) like your credit card number. With the growth of the Internet, privacy has taken on a greater importance due to the massive amount of data being collected by online products and services. Internet platforms may now know more about you than anyone else – including your partner, family, and close friends. Some have expressed concerns that platforms can even influence the way you think. More importantly, the information can end up in the wrong hands, like authoritarian governments or malicious actors, where it can be used to sway public opinion, target key allies, or conduct corporate espionage. History In the absence of a federal privacy standard, a patchwork of laws and enforcement agencies govern individual data. The FTC is asked to enforce privacy protections for consumer financial information (Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970), government-held personally identifiable information (Privacy Act of 1974), data for minors under 13 (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998), and information-sharing practices (Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999). Nowadays, other agencies are also tasked with ensuring the privacy of data, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (financial data) and the Department of Human and Health Services (health data). Even though the American public overwhelmingly supports a federal privacy standard, there has never been a federal law protecting baseline privacy rights. In the absence of such a law, privacy regulation has shifted to individual states; as of this writing, seven states have passed their own privacy legislation, while another 20 states have introduced bills. That doesn’t include legislation to specifically protect biometric data, such as Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act. Further, Europe passed its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 that regulates data privacy and collection for European citizens. Due to the global nature of the Internet, many firms have decided to extend GDPR requirements to everyone, not just European residents. Provisions The ADPPA includes several important privacy protections for Americans. It requires firms to only collect and transfer&hellip;",

    "content": "Overview: The rise of social media has indisputably defined the 21st century. In 2021, 72% of Americans enjoy social media as a place to learn, connect, share, and express themselves—whether that’s through photo-sharing sites, blogging apps, discussion forums, or shopping platforms. It has advanced human progress in many areas of life. Despite immense popularity, there is bipartisan consensus there are negative impacts of social media such as concerns over youth mental health, misinformation, censorship, and the incitement of violence. In particular, there is some concern that social media platforms play an increasingly prominent role in the radicalization of extremists, specifically young adults, who may search, consume, and spread harmful content with like-minded individuals online. On May 18, 2022, New York Attorney General Letitia James launched an investigation into Discord, Twitch, 4chan, and other platforms for their alleged role in online radicalization of the young man who committed a mass shooting at a Buffalo, NY grocery store. He had been particularly active on social media leading up to the attack. Sadly, on May 24, 2022, another troubled young man killed 21 at an elementary school in Uvalde, TX after posting for weeks on Yubo that he was set on violence. As America continues to grieve these national tragedies, the aftermath has raised many ethical questions about digital accountability and reinvigorated the debate surrounding online content moderation, which is governed by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The overall debate surrounding Section 230 is embedded with issues of social media liability, free expression, and content moderation. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have grown speculative of Section 230, although for different reasons involving pro-moderation versus anti-censorship arguments. Policymakers’ concerns have also been amplified by recent revelations by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen who argued that the company&#8217;s algorithms are dangerous and Congressional action is needed. However, many, including the tech industry, argue that advanced algorithms have been employed to restrict and catch troublesome content, although there are limitations. For example, Twitch removed the live-stream of the Buffalo attack in less than two minutes, although millions later saw the viral footage and social media companies struggled to stop its circulation. As the debate around online radicalization and social media intensifies, we take a look at Section 230. Definitions: Section 230 has two key provisions that govern the Internet: 1. Section 230(c)(1): “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. Known as the 26 words that created the internet, the first section states that social media platforms are protected from being legally liable for the content users post on their platforms. The basic rule is that users are responsible for their own actions and speech on the Internet. 2. Section 230(c)(2): “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of…any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the&hellip;",

Additionally, the Biden administration has set an executive order goal of delivering 40% of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments to disadvantaged communities, but delivering on the racial and social equity promises of the Justice40 Initiative requires a long-term commitment and whole-of-government coordination. On April 26th, the American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) and the Bipartisan Policy Center hosted a virtual event with inclusive energy workforce experts knowledgeable in leveraging government investment and private-public collaboration to ensure the participation of all communities. The event featured remarks from House Committee on Energy and Commerce member Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX), followed by a panel discussion with: Robert Matthews, VP and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer at Exelon Ralph Cleveland, President &amp; CEO of AABE Arlen Herrell, Deputy Chief of Innovation and Partnerships, District of Columbia Department of Employment Services The event began with Veasey highlighting the transformative opportunity posed by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the challenge to build a national clean energy sector that uplifts all Americans. Veasy’s remarks were followed by a fantastic panel with decades of experience in building an inclusive clean energy workforce. Matthews emphasized the need to interlink the mission of companies with an inclusive workforce.  Cleveland highlighted that cultivating a resilient, innovative, and thriving clean energy supply chain and economy requires engagement with underrepresented entrepreneurs.   Given his extensive experience in supporting and developing workers from all backgrounds at DC Department of Employment Services, Herrell spoke about mechanisms in government that enable an inclusive workforce.    Success in workforce inclusion and development depends on the continuous commitment and accountability to measurable outcomes.

    "content": "To date, most of the debate about regulating tech has focused on the big platforms &#8211; Meta/Facebook, Google, Amazon, and to some extent Twitter. However, increasingly we’re seeing the emergence of smaller platforms including TikTok, Twitch, NextDoor, Telegram, Signal, and many others. Moreover, recent tragedies such as the Buffalo shooting have shown how newer apps such as Yubo or Discord are having a great impact on newer generations. The continued evolution of the internet, including changes in how people are using social media and the emergence of new apps, is proving to be a challenge not just for regulators trying to write rules in this space, but for the platforms themselves who may not have the experience or resources necessary to police problematic content. Let’s take a look at the challenges for each &#8211; starting with the platforms. Start-ups by definition tend to be lean. When Instagram was acquired by Facebook back in 2012, it had 13 employees and 25 million users. WhatsApp had 55 employees for 420 million users. Today Yubo has 113 employees and Discord has 1872. These numbers are a far cry from the tens of thousands of just content moderators that the big platforms employ, let alone the number of engineers, data scientists, researchers, and policy experts that work every day to keep their platforms safe. While this can be good for the bottom line, it becomes challenging when bad actors shift to using your platform specifically because of its lack of ability to police content. Startup or smaller platforms likely won’t have very robust content moderation policies, nor will they have built the tools to proactively find problematic content. They won’t have the experience of dealing with requests from governments and law enforcement. In some cases, governments may not know how to contact these platforms. Recently in Brazil, Brazil&#8217;s Supreme Court blocked Telegram for neglecting the country&#8217;s repeated contact attempts. This could have led to the permanent shut down of the Telegram app in Brazil. Additionally, these social media platforms won’t have the resources to produce robust transparency reports, have ad libraries of political and issue ads, or provide data to researchers. While bigger technology companies have the capacity to act quicker, sometimes it&#8217;s not enough. For example, Twitch removed the Buffalo shooter’s live video in less than two minutes and with only 22 viewers, but that’s all it took for this content to then live on and be spread across many other platforms big and small, despite attempts to conceal the media. This then proves to be a challenge for policymakers trying to regulate in this space. How do you find the right balance between making sure online platforms act responsibly, but don’t put so much burden on them that you inadvertently stifle the growth and innovation of these apps &#8211; some of which could become major competitors to the big players? In Europe, the answer has been the Code of Practice on Disinformation which is an agreement that platforms and others voluntarily sign&hellip;",

    "content": "Every day, urban design impacts our lives almost imperceptibly. While some design approaches are more obvious, such as speed bumps that slow drivers down and security cameras that discourage theft, many design choices affect human behavior without conscious awareness. For example, restaurant chairs are often deliberately uncomfortable to encourage faster dining, and sidewalk tiling can influence pedestrian walking patterns. Similarly, digital design impacts our daily interaction with consumer technology, such as smartphones, mobile applications, and social media. However, as many lawmakers have drawn attention to in the past year, this isn’t always a good thing. Our smartphones are habit-forming, and social media platforms are under fire for impacting mental health and spreading misinformation. While these concerns often lead to calls for improved content moderation, many of the same design principles that serve to make technology broadly adopted by users can also help improve safety at scale. In addition to content moderation teams, companies can use design to limit the creation of inaccurate, misleading, fake, or offensive content and provide tools to users that will help them navigate this content once it’s already in circulation. This type of design, often referred to as integrity design, informs many of the platforms we know and interact with already. In 2021, Twitter launched a feature that detects when a tweet is considered unkind and encourages users to reconsider the post by displaying a prompt asking, “Want to review this before Tweeting?” According to Twitter, 34% of people revise their initial reply or decide not to send the response at all. Building on such interventions, the NUDGE Act, introduced last February, requires the Federal Trade Commission to identify interventions that reduce the harm of algorithm-driven amplification. Distinct from Twitter’s new feature, however, interventions would be content-agnostic. For example, a pop-up asking users if they want to read an article before sharing it. Rather than using pop-ups, many forums rely on reputation systems that encourage users to monitor themselves. On Reddit, for example, any user can up and downvote posts, allowing users who receive upvotes to accumulate “karma.” Reputation-based systems remind the individual to behave respectfully, make quality contributions, and are visible to anyone who clicks that person’s username. Most well-known social media platforms that allow unmoderated posts (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) also enforce “rate limits.” These limits disincentivize behaviors like spamming the same comment into multiple groups or sending an egregious number of direct messages to other users by limiting access to features once a user has reached some pre-set limit. In these examples, companies curb the supply of low-quality content by encouraging good behavior. Unfortunately, however, incentives do little when the information ecosystem rewards bad behavior. To help users navigate misinformation or otherwise low-quality posts, Meta began applying labels on Facebook’s News Feed. By assisting people to identify posts from official officeholders rather than Fan and Satire Pages, users can make better decisions about what types of content they’d like to consume. Similarly, Meta also applies informative overlays and labels on Facebook and Instagram&hellip;",

    "content": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs spur innovation, bolster U.S. economic competitiveness, and strengthen the small business sector. With authorization expiring September 30th, there&#8217;s an urgency to act now. Through reauthorization, Congress can eliminate uncertainty and make improvements that enhance impact, foster broader participation in entrepreneurship, and increase commercialization of federal investments. Importantly, Congress can make these needed improvements while addressing legitimate concerns about multiple award recipients. Both the SBIR and STTR programs award federal grants to small businesses to engage in research and development to discover and commercialize new technologies. (A recent BPC explainer provides an overview of both programs for those looking to understand the basics.) These innovative endeavors are capital-intensive, and success uncertain. Like any investor, the federal government has an expectation that taxpayers receive a reasonable return on their investment (ROI). Unsurprisingly, policymakers and others have sought more information about small businesses that win multiple SBIR and STTR awards year over year. A particular question is how effective multiple award winners are in driving commercialization by leveraging repeat awards. Assessing Multiple Award Recipients Winning more than one award over several years is common. An SSTI analysis of SBIR awards between 2009 and 2019 found that over half (58.5%) of Phase I awards went to companies that won two or more. Multiple awardees have a large presence in the SBIR ecosystem—and not all multiple awardees could be classified as &#8220;mills.&#8221; This is a term used critically by those who see multiple awardees as abusing the system by winning many awards yet producing few commercial outcomes. Importantly, there is significant variation across federal agencies. Most companies that receive Phase II awards from the National Science Foundation, for example, have not received a prior award. At the Defense Department, by contrast, about 80% of Phase II awardees have previously received awards, according to analysis by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Yet, the existence of multiple awardees is not prima facie evidence of cronyism or system manipulation. Research by Maryann Feldman and others has found that firms receiving multiple SBIR awards can play important roles in transferring technology and incubating future entrepreneurs. Measuring Commercial Impact The question of how to determine the economic impact of SBIR awards—and of multiple awardees in particular—is a sticking point. In 2011, Congress directed the Small Business Administration (SBA) and SBIR/STTR granting agencies to establish performance benchmarks that measure progress toward commercialization by small businesses that win multiple awards. These benchmarks assess the rate at which small businesses transition from Phase I to Phase II awards and gauge their commercialization activities, as measured by sales, investment, and patents. Establishment of benchmarks was a step in the right direction toward program accountability and results. A 2018 Government Accountability Office report, however, found that data challenges, such as difficulty developing commercialization metrics that are consistently applicable across a wide variety of agencies and projects, limited the ability to assess the commercialization outcomes of small businesses that receive SBIR and&hellip;",

    "content": "Immigrant entrepreneurs have long been a part of communities around the United States. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s recent report, Immigration Entrepreneurship: Economic Potential and Obstacles to Success assesses who these immigrants are, what kinds of businesses they invest in, why they chose this path, and what obstacles they face to entrepreneurship. To launch this report, the Managing Director of Immigration and Cross-Border Policy Theresa Cardinal Brown moderated an expert panel discussion on the report findings. The panelists included: Cris Ramón, global and U.S. immigration policy researcher and analyst; Christina da Silva, welcoming communities and immigrant affairs officer at the City of Dallas; Dane Stangler, director of strategic initiatives at BPC; and Adrian Bota, co-founder and CEO of Origin Milk and an immigrant entrepreneur. Below are key takeaways from the webinar. Immigrant Entrepreneurs play a significant role in the U.S. economy In the U.S., entrepreneurship is responsible for most net new job growth. Out of 100,000 adults, 580 immigrants are entrepreneurs compared to 320 out of every 100,000 native-born Americans. Without immigrant entrepreneurship, as Dane Stangler pointed out, declines in job growth from COVID-19 would have been substantially worse. Understanding what drives immigrants to start their own businesses as well as the obstacles they face in doing so is imperative to understanding how to support local and national economic needs. The need for integration of economic growth into the U.S. immigration system The panelists discussed the need for national legislation that supports immigrant entrepreneurship. Cris Ramón highlighted one of the main recommendations of the report: an entrepreneurship visa that would allow entrepreneurs to move to or remain in the U.S. This would more clearly align U.S. immigration policy with economic growth measures. Dane Stangler noted that many other developed countries maintain such visas. Adrian Bota explained that immigrant entrepreneurs often come from countries that do not value innovation. In the U.S. they can address unmet needs, engineer new ideas and systems, and add value to their communities, but there needs to be a pathway for them to do so. The role of local municipalities Christina da Silva offered the local perspective of how the city of Dallas has worked to uplift immigrant entrepreneurs and maximize their success, underscoring the need for local engagement. By creating accessible and easy to navigate information, leveraging local connections and institutions, and investing in data collection, the city has compiled a one-stop shop for resources and guidance for immigrant entrepreneurs, allowing these entrepreneurs to address all of their needs in fewer visits. The report and webinar provide additional information on the state of U.S. immigrant entrepreneurship and what data is still needed in order to maximize immigrant entrepreneurs’ economic potential.

    "content": "The scientific community broadly agrees that carbon management technologies, including carbon dioxide removal (CDR), need to significantly scale in the coming decades to reach net zero carbon emissions by midcentury. However, absent a program to cap or price these emissions, CDR projects will need tailored policy support to produce reliable revenue streams to fund and operate at scale. The federal government is the world’s largest purchaser of goods and services, and leveraging this purchasing power can help develop early markets and provide demand pull for CDR. In 2021, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s DAC Advisory Council released a series of federal policy recommendations to position the United States as a world leader in direct air capture (DAC) technology deployment. Many of the council’s recommendations passed as part of the Energy Act of 2020 and the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The IIJA included over $18.9 billion over five years for carbon management, including $3.5 billion to deploy four regional DAC hubs that will demonstrate and scale DAC technologies in the coming decade. The Department of Energy is actively engaging with stakeholders on effective implementation of these hubs, and the IIJA funding will help establish the requisite infrastructure and resources these hubs need. At present, the operational costs for these hubs are likely to be covered by voluntary environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related investments from the private sector. A few early adopters like Stripe and Alphabet have stepped up with advanced market commitments that prioritize the long-term carbon storage that DAC provides, despite costing more than nature based carbon removal. Without additional policy support, increased investments in the long-term operation of DAC facilities at scale is unclear. The moment is right for the federal government to send a strong market signal towards high quality carbon removal projects to leverage even further private sector investment in this still nascent technology. Policymakers have the opportunity to create a market for CDR with two bills currently before Congress: the Federal Carbon Dioxide Removal Leadership Act in the House and Senate and the Carbon Removal and Emissions Storage Technologies (CREST) Act in the Senate.",

    "content": "The annual federal funding process allows Congress to focus investments on the most impactful federal energy and climate initiatives, supporting vital programs that are key to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and addressing climate change economy-wide. BPC developed recommendations for Congress to consider for fiscal year 2023 appropriations for the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of the Interior. Collectively, these investments support funding to boost innovation and unlock regulation for key climate and energy programs in a way that is environmentally responsible and equitable. Department of Agriculture Regional Climate Hubs Our recommendation: BPC recommends $45 million for the USDA Agricultural Research Service’s Regional Climate Hubs. The increased funding will allow the program to scale up the critical work the Hubs do in providing science-based information and tools on climate change to agricultural managers and foresters. Why this is important: Climate Hubs connect USDA research and program agencies to the communities that they serve—agricultural producers and professionals—by delivering timely and authoritative tools and information. Hubs develop science-based, regional-specific information, technologies, and assistance, alongside USDA agencies and partners, which enable agricultural and natural resource managers to make climate-informed decisions. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Our recommendation: BPC supports the president’s budget request of $140 million to the Sustainable Agriculture Systems (SAS) program under USDA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) to facilitate development of regionally-based, low-carbon, local biomass industries like the production of sustainable aviation fuels. Why this is important: The Coordinated Agricultural Projects (CAPs), housed under the SAS program, supports regionally-specific projects to connect local biomass supply chains to commercial value such as advanced biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel. These projects provide triple benefits – reducing emissions, enhancing economic investment and job creation in rural areas, and improving national energy security. This additional funding will enable AFRI to fund more projects, like the conversion of wood waste to jet fuel in the Pacific Northwest, building up regional biomass supply chains across the country. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E) Our recommendation: BPC recommends $575 million to support additional solicitations and an increase for scale-up and demonstration of innovative energy projects. This is in line with the FY2023 authorization in the Energy Act of 2020. Why this is important: ARPA-E’s innovative approach to funding transformative, early-stage energy research boosts U.S. energy security, economic competitiveness, and employment opportunities. However, at the current funding level, ARPA-E must frequently turn away innovative, potentially game-changing energy projects. Expanding the program’s funding will allow it to undertake additional projects and accelerate its mission to revolutionize the energy sector, ensuring the United States stays at the cutting edge of energy science and technology. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Crosscut Initiative Our recommendation: BPC recommends $337 million for a crosscutting initiative for research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) of CDR technologies and approaches to provide support for a comprehensive suite of scalable CDR solutions. We recommend coordination across DOE Offices of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), Science, Energy Efficiency&hellip;",

Campus Happenings Lee University to Bar Students From &#8216;Identifying&#8217; Or &#8216;Behaving&#8217; As A Different Gender, As New Policy Draws Criticism Wyatt Massey | Chattanooga Times Free Press | May 22, 2022 A private evangelical Christian university is facing scrutiny over a draft policy that prohibits students, faculty, or staff members from advocating “in person, in writing, or online for sexual acts, behaviors, or lifestyles that are contrary to Scripture.” An expert on LGBTQ student experiences is quoted, saying that this draft policy exemplifies a trend at evangelical schools. Judge Rules Against UH Anti-discrimination Policy John Lomax | The Cougar | May 24, 2022 A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against the University of Houston, a public university, finding that its anti-discrimination policy likely infringes on students’ rights. “‘The University cannot choose to abide by the First Amendment in the Constitution,’ the injunction stated. ‘It is not guidance — it is the law.’” Prior to the ruling, the university updated its policy; however, the judge ruled that “voluntary cessation does not guarantee the University will not amend its policies.” Christian Student Challenges University’s No-Contact Order Ashley Vaughan | World | June 7, 2022 A graduate student at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville is suing the university, a public institution, for damages and an admission that it violated her constitutional rights. The school had ordered her not to contact several students, who complained about her social media posts and messages. “In the past, such orders were typically reserved for instances of sexual harassment or threats of violence.” State and Federal University System of Georgia Nixes Free Speech Zones Amy Rock | Campus Safety Magazine | June 2, 2022 “The University System of Georgia Board of Regents voted last week to change their institutions’ free speech policies to align with new legislation &#8230; designates all unrestricted outdoor spaces that are part of the 26-campus system to be used as public forums … Georgia is the 22nd state to ban free speech zones, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.” Op-Eds and Thought Pieces Diversity Statements Are the New Faith Statements Justin P.

    "content": "Throughout the pandemic, Congress passed several relief packages, resulting in historic investments in child care. When these emergency funds expire in September, 2024 states could be facing a significant funding cliff &#8212; all 50 states and the District of Columbia will be facing a potential fiscal cliff of $48 billion. If pandemic emergency funds are exhausted without additional federal funding, it will have disastrous consequences for child care providers still struggling with the lingering impacts of the pandemic, forcing the nation even further into a child care supply crisis. Consequences of Short-Term Pandemic Relief COVID-19 ravaged the child care industry, exposing the instability of a business model working under razor-thin profit margins and a low-paid, highly skilled workforce with high turnover rates. The passage of successive pandemic relief packages the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA), and the American Rescue Plan (ARP) was a lifeline that temporarily salvaged the industry. One of these packages allocated $24 billion to directly help providers respond to the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. This historic investment allowed many child care providers to re-open with smaller class sizes, purchase personal protective equipment and more cleaning supplies for teachers and staff, or give direct cash incentives to teachers to retain staff. While ARP provided much-needed relief, it is short-lived. ARP’s funding runs out in September,2024. States, used to operating with a tremendous influx of child care funds, will face a daunting decrease of funding, returning to pre-pandemic funding levels. This funding has been essential to fortify the child care industry against the pandemic, helping providers to fund personnel costs, rent and facility maintenance, personal protective equipment, equipment to deal with the public health emergency, goods and services needed to resume child care, and mental health support for children and employees. After the last ARP dollars are spent and absent any additional and substantial increases in funding, child care providers will be left without the critical supports they’ve depended on to stay open and retain their staff, further plunging the nation into a child care supply crisis. The Magnitude of the Fiscal Cliff No state is immune. The 50 states and the District of Columbia are facing a fiscal cliff of over $48 billion. Fourteen states are facing shortfalls of more than $1 billion dollars. Texas, California, and Florida are facing the largest cliffs, potentially $5.70 billion, $4.81 billion, and $3.18 billion, respectively. For example, North Carolina received over $1.97 billion in Child Care and Development Funds (CCDF) in FY 2021, up from over $293 million in FY 2019. Part of the increase stems from ARP discretionary funding and child care stabilization grants, which enabled the state to distribute $340 million to over 4,000 child care centers, allowing North Carolina child care providers to compensate their workforce and salvage existing child care slots. As 2024 approaches, North Carolina is facing a cliff of $1.67 billion. Losing this funding would jeopardize years of work to stabilize the industry.&hellip;",

    "content": "American households face widespread financial insecurity, with lack of short-term savings a particularly urgent issue. A recent national BPC survey found that a broad swath of workers live paycheck to paycheck, with almost 1/3 of respondents saying they could cover roughly a month or less of expenses if they lost their income. Over the past several years, the retirement industry has made significant progress in developing and implementing emergency savings solutions for American workers. Looking at data from early adopters, the takeaways are clear–adequate emergency savings can: Enhance financial wellness; Protect retirement savings, functioning as a buffer against early withdrawals; and Serve as an important building block toward increased contributions to retirement, especially for households living on low- to moderate- incomes (LMI). Along with AARP Public Policy Institute and Saverlife, we recently outlined five key principles for public policy innovations in this space: Allow for automatic enrollment in workplace emergency savings; Ensure emergency savings are their own “bucket” of savings; Allow for a wide range of design options, particularly for LMI households; Structure emergency savings tools to meet household needs; and Safeguard retirement savings. In this brief, we dive deeper into the final principle, with a focus on how new tools to save for emergencies might impact retirement savings. Emergency savings can safeguard existing retirement savings There is growing evidence that emergency and retirement savings can go hand in hand. Simply put, well-crafted emergency savings solutions can be buffers against early withdrawals from retirement. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, households with at least $1,000 in emergency savings were half as likely to withdraw funds from their workplace retirement accounts as those who had no savings. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 59% of retirement account holders without emergency savings withdrew from their account in the past year, compared to only 9% of those with at least a month of income in emergency savings. Beyond early withdrawals, research also shows that automatic enrollment into emergency savings accounts is unlikely to significantly detract from retirement contributions. In other words, most of the funds going into the new accounts would be additive. Indeed, a prominent existing trial of an emergency savings sidecar product by UPS has reported preliminary findings that it has not reduced retirement contributions. In addition, automatic enrollment tends to be sticky: workers are able to opt-out at any time, but tend to participate at the levels at which they are automatically enrolled. Vanguard recently found that its plans using automatic enrollment had an average 92% participation rate in 2020, compared with 62% for voluntary enrollment plans. Employer matching contributions and tax preferences also encourage savings and are important features to consider in emergency savings policy innovation. Emergency savings may help bring more people into the retirement system The workers who stand to benefit most from emergency savings solutions are those not currently contributing to a retirement account. A recent Pew Research Center study found that an important reason workers do not contribute to retirement is lack of liquidity–if there is&hellip;",

    "content": "A policy shift is happening in the United States’ tech regulatory debate around how we communicate online and who controls what is seen. While discussions around free expression, censorship, and content moderation remain strong &#8211; many are also realizing that any regulation on those issues is likely to fail on First Amendment grounds. That is why there is a shift in regulatory proposals to require social media companies to increase transparency around their inner workings. Legislators are hoping that requiring more transparency from platforms will help the public better understand how content – especially problematic content like mis and disinformation – gains traction, how the algorithms decide what content to show or recommend to people, as well as data about how people engage with different kinds of content. As this national debate continues, states are moving forward with their own. Republicans feel this will help them identify any coordinated bias against their content, while Democrats want more transparency to understand how much mis and disinformation is spreading. But what does it mean for tech to be more transparent, and what kind of transparency will give us the answers that we think we need? Today, many tech companies already have robust transparency sites that outline their community standards, their enforcement of those standards, the government requests they get for data, and many other things. Here are links to reports from Meta, Twitter, Google/YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok. Some platforms like Meta and Google also offer transparency into the political and issue ads running on their sites. Meta also allows some insight into all ads running at any given time. Another way companies attempt transparency is by giving a glimpse into the content on their platforms. Twitter has long had the most robust pipeline through its API. Meta has tried to do this through their Crowdtangle tool and a project known as Social Science One. However, Meta is now restricting access to these tools, which have been plagued by delays and bugs. Unfortunately, these efforts have fallen short of what researchers, journalists, and others want from the platforms to understand what is happening on them. They do not trust the companies to present the complete picture of what is happening, and they want the ability to confirm on their own. They also want to know more about the metrics companies prioritize and how they design their ranking algorithms. However, asking for these figures versus getting something that will give regulators and the public the insights they want are two very different things. It will be very challenging for companies to give a complete picture of why certain pieces of content are shown to an individual or not for a few reasons. First, hundreds &#8211; if not thousands – of inputs are used to determine what a person might want to see. This can make it hard to determine exactly which ones were prioritized for that piece of content. Second, there are multiple algorithms and other classifiers in play at any point in time.&hellip;",

    "content": "The news that Title 42, a public health order by both the Trump and Biden administrations to manage migration at the border would come down on May 23, 2022, has generated a decidedly mixed response, amid worries that the end of the public health order would result in a large number of new arrivals at the southern border. The order ultimately did not end, as a federal judge issued a hold on the phase-out of Title 42 on May 20. Democrats and Republicans have called for a more detailed plan to be put in place before the order is lifted, with some advocating for the order to stay in place until the end of the public health emergency. When Title 42 comes down, apprehended migrants will again be processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection under Title 8 of the U.S. code. CBP tracks the processing disposition related to each apprehension which is made on a case-by-case basis. Below we examine how CBP managed encounters in the fiscal year 2022 which will likely reflect how dispositions of migrants will break down after Title 42 ends. Under current Biden administration policies, the majority of those not excluded under Title 42 have been released into the U.S. If this pattern holds after the end of Title 42, it could double the number of people released into the U.S. to await court hearings to determine if they are ultimately ordered deported. However, the administration has said it intends to increase the use of expedited removal, which could reduce the percentage of migrants released into the U.S. given the similarities between the populations that have been expelled under Title 42 and those amenable to expedited removal (largely single adults and many from Mexico).

With natural disasters becoming more frequent and severe, strategic investments in resilient infrastructure are crucial to save lives, reduce the costs of disaster response and recovery efforts, and help affected communities recover more quickly—all while creating jobs. Specifically, the law provided nearly $7 billion to FEMA largely to advance these efforts, including: Flood Mitigation Assistance Program: $3.5 billion over five years to reduce the risk of repetitive flood damage. Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities: $1 billion over five years for competitive grant funding to states and local communities for hazard mitigation projects. National Dam Safety Program: $733 million over five years to improve the safety of dams and upgrade aging dams. Safeguarding Tomorrow Through Ongoing Risk Mitigation (STORM) Act: $500 million over five years so FEMA can provide capitalization grants to states and eligible tribal governments to create revolving loan funds that can finance state and local hazard mitigation projects. State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program: $1 billion over four years to establish a new grant program for state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to modernize their IT networks and infrastructure to better respond to cyber threats.

    "content": "Today’s labor market is one of transition: What was once seen as a Great Resignation is turning out to be the Great Reshuffle. With labor supply restricted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and firms seeking millions of employees, many workers are using their leverage to obtain new roles at higher wages. Consequently, average wages are rapidly rising as workers are successfully demanding higher pay in an economy where resignations and job openings are near all-time highs. A new BPC-Morning Consult poll reveals that there are some who are not sharing in this success: working mothers. Instead working moms face conditions that are quite the opposite. They are emerging from the pandemic in a financially fragile state, facing caregiving-related barriers to economic security, switching jobs, and advancing their careers. Mothers are leaving jobs to care for loved ones or changing roles for more flexible hours. These challenges are punctuated by 8% inflation in the near-term and negative earnings and career ramifications in the long-term. The poll reveals that policy solutions targeted to address these challenges would have outsized positive impacts on working moms. Paid family leave, affordable childcare, workplace flexibility, and emergency savings accounts would enhance their financial security, advance their careers, positively influence their ability to support their families, and support their mental health. These impacts are not theoretical. Working moms who enjoy these benefits now cite them as instrumental in our poll. Top Findings Mothers in the workforce face heightened financial insecurity. 59% of working moms are unable to go more than four weeks without pay and still afford basic needs, including 26% who are unable to go a single week without a paycheck. Over half of mothers in the workforce (51%) feel less financially secure today than they did before the pandemic. Caregiving poses long-term barriers to career advancement and entrepreneurship, which may contribute to gender pay inequities in the years to come. Large majorities of mothers in the workforce are not comfortable taking a new job that aligns with their career interests but would require more demanding hours (73%), offer less workplace flexibility (61%), less job security (79%), or fewer benefits (73%). Among mothers who would like to start their own business, 53% cite caregiving for children as a barrier to doing so, including 72% of those without access to affordable childcare. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded these challenges, forcing mothers to make difficult decisions and sacrifice their well-being. During the pandemic, caregiving responsibilities led roughly one-third of working mothers to reduce work hours (33%), change jobs to have more flexible hours (29%), choose to not pursue career opportunities (35%), and modify their career ambitions (37%). Caregiving responsibilities also led over half of working mothers to reduce spending on everyday essential items like groceries and transportation (53%), reduce spending on non-essential activities like going out to eat (66%), and take less time for themselves (62%). Policy solutions and employer-provided benefits would have outsized positive impacts on working mothers’ careers, financial stability, families, and mental health. 62% of&hellip;",

Not doing so yields the technological advantage and edge to countries with strategic interests in technology. The America COMPETES Act, &#8220;which is being conferenced with the Senate-passed USICA bill, includes an immigration provision under section 80303 that exempts advanced degree holders in STEM fields from green card caps. In 2020, international students supported an estimated 410,000 American jobs, particularly in STEM. In 2021, 54% of international students pursued a major in a STEM field, and in 2019 almost half of all masters and doctorates awarded in STEM fields went to international students. Yet, in 2019, over 918,000 IT jobs went unfilled. American companies, not only technology-focused ones, struggle to meet the STEM critical skills shortage and find it increasingly challenging to hire graduates with the degrees needed to drive innovation. To address this issue, the Department of Homeland Security recently announced an expansion to the Optional Practical Training program, a 12 month temporary work permit available to international students graduating from U.S. degree-granting institutions. The new measures add 22 qualifying fields of study to the STEM Designated Degree Program list, increasing the number of international STEM students in emerging tech fields. However, this will not be enough to meet the labor shortage. The United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) aims to develop domestic capacities in semiconductor R&amp;D using $52 billion authorized through the CHIPS for America Fund, and in key technology areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum science, as part of the $120 billion Endless Frontiers Act investment to ensure the U.S. remains competitive in these fields. However, funding these fields means hiring qualified candidates to do the work. Many of those candidates are international students who want to stay in the U.S. after graduating from their programs. Expanding green card caps for international students graduating in these fields will go a long way toward filling that need for tech experts in the United States. This is not the first time the U.S. has expanded green card access to meet critical skill shortages. The Immigration Act of 1965 included a crucial provision that &#8220;gave preference to professionals with skills in short supply in the United States.&#8221; This brought thousands of medical professionals and engineers to the U.S. to fill labor shortages across the country. This program was widely considered a bipartisan success and led to the growth of critical domestic industries. Many of those families still reside in the U.S., and their children lead the next generation of innovation. The crucial difference between then and now is that the IT sector is globally competitive and projected to grow as more countries invest in their domestic tech capabilities. Demand for STEM skills in the U.S. and abroad Graduates of STEM programs are in high demand across the globe. As the IT sector grows, demand for STEM skills in the U.S. will also increase.

    "content": "Rural America is diverse—with unique assets, challenges, economies, and communities. But like most of America, rural households are increasingly facing housing insecurity and high housing cost burdens, while also grappling with more severely substandard housing conditions and more limited access to credit. The Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development plans to explore the housing needs of our country’s rural communities, and USDA’s role in addressing them, in a hearing with the Under Secretary for Rural Development, Xochitl Torres Small. To inform the Subcommittee’s examination of rural housing issues, BPC Housing Council member Jim King authored a statement for the record. Pulling from his experiences at Fahe—a regional, nonprofit, financial intermediary working throughout Appalachia to support access to capital for housing and community development, the statement outlines six key issues that merit both the Subcommittee and the USDA’s attention: Program Income Eligibility Declining Buyer Power and Increasing Project Costs The Appraisal Gap Need to Strengthen Nonprofit Partners Workforce Barriers Federal Match Requirements In advance of the hearing, BPC’s J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy also prepared the following questions:  In its annual reports on opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal government, the Government Accountability Office has repeatedly identified the need for better collaboration and coordination between housing and economic development programs at HUD, USDA, and the Commerce Department. How do you plan to address this recommendation and work more effectively with other federal agencies—particularly HUD—to better meet the housing needs of America’s rural communities? Households in rural areas are often excluded from accessing federal housing assistance, including USDA resources, because of how area median incomes and associated program eligibilities are calculated. USDA has worked creatively to correct the disparities that these rules and calculations create using a policy known as “income banding,” which allows households of various sizes to qualify for programs as if they were larger households. Is there a more permanent and holistic solution to ensure that USDA and other federal housing programs more efficiently and fairly reach the most disadvantaged households and communities?  Natural disasters are becoming more severe and frequent—and with devastating consequences for rural communities. How can USDA help rural communities understand their climate and disaster risks and vulnerabilities and make needed investments in more resilient housing and infrastructure? USDA’s Section 504 program provides grants and loans to low-income seniors for home repairs and modifications in rural areas. Despite the growing number of seniors who could benefit from the program, BPC’s Senior Health and Housing Task Force previously found that burdensome application processes, limited grant and loan amounts, and other issues prevented greater uptake. What is the USDA doing to modernize the Section 504 home repair program and support healthy aging among low-income seniors? An increasing number of both HUD- and USDA-assisted multifamily rental properties are at risk of deterioration and do not have the resources to make fundamental repairs. Absent new federal funding, how is USDA working to prioritize and support the rehabilitation and preservation of affordable&hellip;",

    "content": "It’s been six months since the landmark Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) passed Congress on a strong bipartisan vote. This law finally broke the congressional logjam on infrastructure, which had been the subject of much debate and hand-wringing for years. BPC lauded the passage of the IIJA not only because it promised to restore America’s status as a world leader in infrastructure, but also because it demonstrated that working across the aisle is still possible and can yield great results. Now, six months later, implementation of the IIJA is proceeding at a breakneck pace. The Biden administration is working feverishly to issue the grant announcements, guidance, and rules required to move the IIJA’s promised investment into reality. Senior administration officials are making the rounds this Infrastructure Week to discuss their agencies’ progress. (FEMA joined BPC, the National Association of Counties, and the National League of Cities to explore the agency’s work implementing the resilience and disaster mitigation provisions of the IIJA.) The IIJA’s scale is unprecedented both in terms of the amount of funding available and the infrastructure sectors affected. In the weeks following passage, BPC compiled a list of competitive grant programs authorized in the law, many of which are already moving forward. Airport Infrastructure Grants and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects have already been awarded funding, and awards for the RAISE program, one of the largest of the competitive transportation programs, are expected to be announced in August. All told, a significant amount of federal funding has reached local communities less than a year from the IIJA’s passage. At the same time, the administration is working quickly to issue guidance documents and other resources for implementation. Recently released guidance on the permitting provisions of the IIJA promises to speed approvals for important projects (though how much faster remains to be seen, as BPC’s director of energy policy and carbon management Xan Fishman told the Washington Examiner). A new tool issued under the auspices of the Justice40 Initiative enables state and local infrastructure agencies to identify communities that have historically been underserved, so that these inequities can be addressed with IIJA funds. In April, the White House issued a memorandum with detailed instructions for agencies on adopting practices to support accountability and effective stewardship of IIJA funds. In short, a tremendous amount has been accomplished since the IIJA passed, and it is worth taking a moment during this Infrastructure Week to celebrate that fact. But we must also acknowledge that effective implementation of the IIJA requires more than simply getting the money out the door. It requires the recipients of those funds to use them for projects that will deliver cleaner, safer, and more equitable infrastructure. It requires that federal agencies provide enough technical assistance to grantees to enable them to make these beneficial investments in a cost-effective way. It requires partnerships not only across all levels of government, but with the private sector as well. The success of the IIJA rests not only on its passage,&hellip;",

    "content": "After two years of talking about COVID-19 with the public and press, I, unfortunately, can now say that I have first-hand experience with the illness. It has not been a pretty experience, despite being relatively young and healthy and having received the initial shots as well as a booster. In hopes that it is helpful to others, I’m sharing some lessons I’ve learned in this process. It may seem like a given, but no one wants to get COVID-19. After experiencing teeth chattering chills, weakness, and body aches for several days, it’s hard to imagine what individuals who are unvaccinated go through with this virus. The message of staying up to date with your vaccinations is so important; unfortunately, less than half of adults and only two-thirds of the elderly are boosted according to the CDC. People are understandably tired of the pandemic and the restrictions that have come along with it, but as the death toll from COVID inches toward 1 million this week, they shouldn’t be tired of staying current with vaccinations. With new variants emerging, it is also imperative that our vaccines improve to better match circulating strains—continued funding support from Congress is vital in this effort. I have also gained a better appreciation of my privilege. While it should not be a privilege for me to be able to telework, have paid sick leave, and/or to arrange for childcare if needed, it is indeed a privilege that many aren’t privy to. We need to ensure that the healthy choice is the easy choice, that having to isolate or quarantine while you are sick does not have a lasting impact on personal finances and livelihood. Unfortunately, our policies have not kept up fast enough to support Americans in this way during this pandemic. Equitable access to treatment is still a struggle. Back in December 2020, both my elderly parents became ill with COVID-19. I knew that quickly obtaining a monoclonal antibody infusion therapy which had recently been granted an emergency use authorization from the FDA was likely the only way to prevent severe complications in my parents. They were probably one of the first in the state of Michigan to receive that therapy because of my medical knowledge, contacts with local health care systems, and my persistence. We have made it too hard for Americans without these connections or education to access the interventions they need to stay safe. The launch of COVID19.gov is one step forward in this area. With three of my five household members now having COVID-19, our family’s concern is our youngest who just turned five and therefore has not yet been vaccinated. If he becomes symptomatic, though the risk for severe complications in young kids may be low, the anxiety created by not knowing how his immune system will handle the virus is real. Vaccination rates for the 5 to 11 age group are also suboptimal, and recent surveys show that parents of children under 5 would most likely hesitate to vaccinate&hellip;",

    "content": "Breaking down the most recent Zillow data on home values and rents, BPC found: A 20.6% year-over-year increase in home values nationally and a 16.8% increase in rents in March 2022. Year-over-year home values increased in 871 of 873 metro areas (99.8%), while rents increased in all 107 metro areas (100%) for which information was available. 96% of metro areas had home values increase and 95% had rents increase faster than inflation, which rose 8.5% year-over-year as measured by the Consumer Price Index in March. Our biggest takeaway: housing prices have increased almost universally across the country—with more metro areas experiencing rising prices than at any time over the last 20 years. To better understand just how broadly housing costs are increasing across the country, we calculated a diffusion index of home values and rents. Diffusion indices are commonly used to identify and illustrate broad economic trends. A flat line at 50 would indicate that an equal number of metro areas have increasing prices as those that have decreasing prices. Above 50 shows an upward trend in prices among a majority of metros, while below 50 shows a decreasing trend in prices among a majority of metros. As such, the chart below shows not how much prices are rising, but how broadly. It demonstrates that what many are seeing and feeling in their own communities—rising housing costs—is a concern shared widely across the United States. About Our Methodology A diffusion index shows how broadly a particular indicator is changing—i.e., an overall trend—as opposed to a specific level of change. For the diffusion indices above, BPC first calculated the year-over-year changes in all metro areas for which Zillow Home Value Index and Zillow Observed Rent Index was available. Metro areas with increasing prices were then assigned a value of 1, unchanged prices were given a value of 0.5, and decreasing prices were given a value of zero. The index shows the average of these assigned values across all metros. For example, an index at 95% means 95% of metros have increasing prices. Metro areas with missing data were excluded from our calculations. Policy Implications For the past few years, the cost of housing, for both rent and sale, has been rising steadily and, as shown above, almost universally across the United States. While the onset of the pandemic in 2020 briefly disrupted this trend, prices have been rising strongly and broadly since then. As the country continues to struggle with housing affordability, BPC’s Terwilliger Center is working to identify and promote bipartisan policy options to expand the supply of homes and improve the affordability of housing, especially for low-income households and first-time homebuyers.",

    "content": "Will 5G live up to all its promises of providing faster broadband speeds, promoting innovation, and enabling a new generation of AI and machine learning technology? Theoretically yes, but these promises will require investments and action by policymakers, regulators, and private carriers to ensure its deployment is equitable and timely. 5G is the fifth generation of mobile broadband technology as defined by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Mobile carriers are providing 5G services that are intended to deliver internet speeds up to 20 Gbps, 20 times faster than the previous generation of mobile data technology. How does 5G work? Unlike previous generations, 5G has a tremendous capacity to operate on a range of frequencies within the radio spectrum ranging from 1 Hz to 3000 GHz. Frequency bands within the radio spectrum have historically been designated to various applications, such as radio stations or maritime communications. Over the past few decades, these frequencies have been widely adopted by modern broadband and telecommunication technologies; thus, the recent development of mobile broadband technology has led to increasing demand for spectrum availability. The ability for 5G to operate on higher bands gives it an advantage over former generations of mobile broadband technology, such as 4G LTE, which only operate at mid- and low-band ranges, much narrower than 5G. New high-band capabilities are where significant opportunities exist for high-speed service. However, 5G still creates considerable opportunities in mid- and low-bands (see Figure 1). 5G’s operation at any of these frequencies comes with benefits and challenges (see Figure 2). High-band networks can offer the fastest speeds and low latency to many users and devices. However, these promises are limited by the inability of high-band networks to penetrate solid objects. This makes it challenging to reach long distances and is best for stadiums with many users. Mid-band 5G will still offer high-speed service, but not at the peak suggested by 5G carriers. It will provide more reliable service in urban and suburban areas where high-band spectrum can’t. Low-band networks can penetrate most solid objects and will best serve rural areas or, for example, provide cell service to a hiker in a forest. Providers must consider each spectrum&#8217;s different advantages and weaknesses when allocating and prioritizing resources for their 5G networks. Source: T-Mobile  Benefits: The fifth generation of wireless broadband technology is exceedingly faster than previous generations and could significantly contribute to the U.S. economy and competitiveness. Faster Speeds: Mobile 5G mmWave service could deliver speeds up to 20 Gbps download speeds and improved upload speeds. This means faster processing and streaming times. Alternative Home Internet: Fixed wireless access (FWA) from mid-band stations will provide broadband similar to traditional fixed networks. In the mmWave, 5G FWA is capable of gigabit speed, which is comparable to fiber-optic broadband. Lower Latency: The latency of wireless transmissions will be less than ten milliseconds. That’s faster than it takes our brain to process what our eyes see. This will support new applications and AI. Higher Volume: Up to 1000 times more network&hellip;",

    "content": "The Immigrant Entrepreneurship Landscape Immigration and entrepreneurship has deeply impacted America’s economic dominance since the 19th century, with the U.S. developing a strong entrepreneurship culture as it became a country of immigrants. Since then, immigrants have continued to be over-represented among the self-employed, as documented in every economic census since 1880. Immigrants have an entrepreneurship rate of 0.52% with 520 entrepreneurs for every 100,000 immigrants compared to 0.26% for native-born Americans. Forty-three percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by first- or second-generation immigrants, and 28 percent of Main Street businesses (non-chain, brick-and-mortar stores located on a main thoroughfare in a city) were founded by immigrants. Research has found that immigrants act more as “job creators” than “job takers” and play an outsized role in high-growth entrepreneurship. They are more likely to hire employees, even in times of financial hardship. Some research suggests that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs because of personality-based self-selection: those who emigrate willingly are more likely to have a higher level of risk tolerance, which is also necessary when starting a company. However, a more negative consideration, that immigrants are more likely to face discrimination in the workplace, often means that creating jobs for themselves is the most stable option. Immigrants may also replicate successful business models from their home countries and bring them to the United States. Immigrant entrepreneurs are a key part of regional economies, in both major cities and small towns, although cities are especially attractive to immigrants. Data shows that immigrants are more likely to settle in central, larger, fiscally better-off cities that have high labor force participation and lower median incomes. Diverse, liberal, and educated populations are also more likely to welcome immigrants. Some cities have launched initiatives to attract immigrant entrepreneurs as part of their civic revitalization strategies or incorporated them into their overall economic development strategy. One such city is Chicago, whose entrepreneurship landscape we explore more closely in the next section. Case Study: Chicago, Illinois Chicago’s business landscape presents fertile ground for entrepreneurs and potential small business owners. The city has the most diversified economy in the United States, is ranked the top tech ecosystem in the Midwest, and became a &#8220;top three startup city” in 2021, with 12 venture capital firms crossing the nine-figure-fund threshold in the course of the year. The city offers access to startups, incubators, accelerators, and a diverse talent pool. Immigrant entrepreneurs are a crucial part of the thriving entrepreneurship ecosystem in Chicago. Nearly 24% of employer-firm owners in the city are foreign-born, even though 20.6% of the general Chicago population was born abroad. This high figure can be attributed to Chicago being an “established immigrant gateway city,” with its large foreign-born population and higher institutional and financial capacities to assist them. For example, Little Village, a largely Mexican neighborhood, is home to the second highest-grossing shopping street in Chicago: 26th Street. The neighborhood’s contribution to the city economy highlights the importance of immigrants and immigrant entrepreneurs to the local economy.&hellip;",

    "content": "Last week, Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state and U.S. ambassador to the U.N., was laid to rest. Albright, who passed away in March at the age of 84, will be remembered by many for her leadership, warmth, and persistent sense of humor. As President Joe Biden remarked at her memorial service, &#8220;Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world. Madeleine never minced words or wasted time when she saw something needed fixing, or someone who needed helping. She just got to work.” To us, she will also be remembered as the beloved president of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation, of which we are both recipients. The Truman Scholarship is a premier national undergraduate public service scholarship. Each year, the foundation reviews over 600 applications for our 55-65 scholarships awarded annually. Albright was proud to lead the foundation, speaking of Truman as “a doer, whose plain words and bold actions mended a broken world, saved freedom, and embodied the principles of our nation at its best.” Albright’s namesake fellowship housed at the Truman Foundation serendipitously led to our joining the Bipartisan Policy Center. From September to May each year, Truman-Albright fellows work a public service job in the Washington, D.C. area, build relationships with assigned mentors, and attend bi-monthly professional development sessions. As fresh transplants from Utah and South Dakota, we wanted to work with an organization that values smart policy and civil discourse. It was important to us that the work we did in D.C. also improved lives back home and across the country, a goal shared by BPC. During our final session of this year’s Truman-Albright programming, we had the privilege of being addressed by Secretary Albright herself. We were excited to hear her speak, for both her words of guidance and her presence as a political icon. We hoped that, in our short hour together, we might study the character of a person whose decisions have affected countless lives across the globe, who endured many demanding years within the federal government, and who survived political trauma in her own childhood. We were touched by the care she took with us. She spoke to us as equals, unperturbed by generational differences that often work against young, inexperienced public servants. She was interested in our concerns and validated the difficulty of our position as young people entering the fray during a fraught and unprecedented era. Her record and reputation speak for themselves, but Secretary Albright’s humanity and warmth immediately reveals how a single person could touch the world the way she has. A champion of human rights and democracy, we were struck by her candid, matter of fact personality. Her forwardness was part and parcel of her unwavering commitment to the values she led the United States in defending and upholding. She spoke with an urgency that reminded us that whether or not we see or feel the danger of tyranny in our day to day lives, our attention and sustained&hellip;",

    "content": "While the world remains focused on Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine, in the United States, we must not lose sight of the fact that midterm primaries start this month. Many of these races are highly charged intra-party contests &#8211; some of which have a candidate who continues to believe that the 2020 election was not legitimate. COVID and late-breaking redistricting changes further complicate these primaries, setting the stage for a confused electorate that could be vulnerable to mis- and disinformation campaigns. While the Russian war and U.S. primary elections differ markedly, there is much U.S. actors can learn from efforts to fight back against Russian propaganda surrounding the war in Ukraine. These include: 1. Be transparent about potential threats: Across the security community, it has been widely recognized that the U.S. government&#8217;s unprecedented move of releasing intelligence about Russia’s disinformation campaign was successful. The federal government and others should consider doing the same for any potential issues they are aware of in the lead-up to the midterms. 2. Call out the potential for disinformation early and what that might be: In addition to being transparent about the threats that Russia posed, the U.S. government and others were very early, vocal, and aggressive in calling out the potential disinformation campaigns before they happened. The United States needs to regularly remind people to be vigilant in what they share and see around the election. This is especially important as Facebook last year said the U.S. is the top target for disinformation and we know that both Russia and China learn and work together to spread it. 3. Cooperate among government, tech, business, and civil society: Instead of pointing fingers at one another about what they thought the other should be doing for the Russian invasion, various entities took whatever actions they could to punish Russia and to protect the Ukrainian people. The government enacted sanctions, the tech companies took actions to reduce the spread of Russian propaganda, businesses pulled out of the country and civil society mobilized to do everything from monitoring and fighting back on disinformation to helping the many Ukrainian refugees fleeing the country. We need to see the same level of cooperation between governments, tech companies and civil society for what is happening here at home. While productive debate should be encouraged, it is imperative that all actors do their part rather than expecting another entity to protect the integrity of our elections. 4. Recognize and appreciate nuance: In the beginning days of the invasion, things on the ground were evolving rapidly. Tech companies were trying to hold Russia accountable for misinformation while staying online to ensure people could get news that was not controlled by the Russian government. Social media companies&#8217; community standards don’t allow calls for violence but had to rethink such policies to allow people to talk about fighting back against the Russian army. At home, it is important to remember that sanctions and other actions did not happen all at once but kept ratcheting up&hellip;",

    "content": "Note: BPC has partnered with the XR Association to set up an XR Initiative to study the policy implications of immersive technology. On January 27, the BPC initiative hosted a private convening with academics, industry representatives, civil society groups, and other stakeholders to better understand the challenges and opportunities immersive technologies create for end-users. This convening followed Chatham House rules to encourage candor, so this post will not identify individual participants. The following piece highlights research leading up to the convening and the convening itself. Introduction Throughout this series of XR convenings, we have assessed opportunities, challenges, and policy questions immersive technologies raise. Today, XR is becoming more accessible to the general population, prompting our discussion for this final convening to address matters affecting those directly using the technology. XR end-users include governments, businesses, and the broader society using immersive technology for various purposes outside of just gaming. The Bipartisan Policy Center convened stakeholders representing civil society, industry, and other groups to discuss XR’s end-users and the role of policy in addressing issues affecting them, like privacy, security, and safety. Who are the End-Users of XR? Immersive technologies have a quickly expanding userbase. According to a report by Insider Intelligence, the virtual reality (VR) userbase topped 50 million people in 2020 and could grow to more than 65 million users by 2023. Meanwhile, the augmented reality (AR) userbase may grow from 80 million to 110 million people in that same timespan. Coinciding with this expanding userbase is increasing applications of immersive technologies far beyond gaming and entertainment. For example, employees use XR to adopt new skills to train for a job; patients access new therapy and treatment methods through XR; students use XR for educational purposes; customers use XR for personal uses such as fitness and retail. Customers have more opportunities to apply XR to their areas of expertise or personal lives. Convening Exercise At our convening, participants identified real-world use cases of XR. They contributed dozens of examples of the ways XR is used in society today. From the medical field to the military, it became clear that a diverse set of stakeholders use XR. Though not an exhaustive list of use cases, this brainstorming exercise achieved its goal of demonstrating the wide range of users that exist today. The group selected four use cases to examine the benefits, limitations, and challenges of these scenarios to the end-user. The first use case looked at automobile manufacturers’ use of XR in prototype design. In the second scenario, the group examined how firefighters train for emergencies in virtual environments. In the third scenario, participants assessed the use of XR by children in educational settings. Finally, in the fourth scenario, participants examined XR used by patients for therapeutic treatment such as exposure therapy for PTSD. In all four scenarios, convening participants identified specific instances XR positively impacts society. Participants expressed how XR may improve user safety because it simulates potentially dangerous environments such as manufacturing facilities and fire training exercises. Convening participants also highlighted scenarios when&hellip;",

    "content": "The recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reaffirms the importance of making major investments in innovative energy and climate solutions like hydrogen and direct air capture (DAC) to achieve a net-zero economy by mid-century. These two technologies offer distinct opportunities and challenges but are related in their potential to provide solutions for hard-to-decarbonize sectors of our economy. To unlock these technology sets and reach our climate goals, significant policy support for deployment and demonstration activities at-scale is needed over the coming decade to drive down costs and establish the requisite supply chains and workforce for long-term operational success. Taking stock of this, last year a bipartisan Congress provided $11.5 billion to the Department of Energy to deploy four Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs and four Regional DAC Hubs as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). What are Hubs and why are they important? “Hubs” are targeted investments in a region to deploy a technology (or set of technologies) through shared infrastructure and resources. These new IIJA programs offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to innovate and deploy clean hydrogen and DAC technologies through a multi-decade, multi-sectoral network of projects, suppliers, and end-users that can leverage their collective infrastructure and institutional knowledge within a region. Hubs can multiply the impact of federal investment and provide a range of benefits. Hubs can integrate the power, transportation, manufacturing and infrastructure sectors together, de-risking clean energy innovation and building a low carbon supply chain simultaneously. Hubs can also strengthen the public-private partnerships necessary for establishing a net-zero carbon economy in the United States that some early movers in the private sector have already begun to invest in. In creating the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs and the Regional DAC Hubs programs, Congress provided critical investments in technology innovation, emission reduction, and workforce development as summarized in Table 1.",

    "content": "Since our first survey in February, there has been a small decrease in the importance voters place on Congress working together to pass bipartisan legislation on the economy, health care, criminal justice, working families, immigration, energy, education, and infrastructure. Additionally, there was a slight decrease by 6% among all voters, 8% among Democrats, and 6% among Republicans in their preference to vote for a member of Congress who finds compromise. As we get closer to the midterm elections and partisan rancor ramps up, BPC will continue to monitor voters’ interest in electing officials who work together. Inflation and Rising Costs Not surprisingly, inflation is becoming a dominant issue in 2022 with voters looking for ways to reduce their household spending, especially low-income households. About two-thirds of voters say they have had to reduce their household spending over the past month due to an increase in gas prices (65%) and increase in the price of groceries (63%). A majority (57%) say it has been difficult to pay their utility payments over the past six months. Nearly two in three (62%) homeowners say it has been difficult to pay for their mortgage, and nearly half (46%) of renters say it has been difficult to pay their monthly rent. When we asked a similar question in September, we found one-third of respondents (35%) said it has been somewhat or very difficult to pay utility bills over the past year. According to the Consumer Price Index, prices rose 1.2% in March for an increase of 8.5% over the past 12 months—the highest year-over-year increase in more than 40 years. BPC’s Inflation Monitor has more data. Misinformation Although a bipartisan majority (69%) of voters are confident their vote will be counted accurately during the midterm elections, 83% of Republicans and 77% of Democrats are also concerned that misinformation will influence the election. Republicans who identify closer to Donald Trump compared to the Republican party are more likely to not be confident their vote will be counted accurately (47%) and be concerned about misinformation influencing the 2022 midterms (88%). Voters from both parties (78%) are concerned about misinformation influencing the 2022 midterms, but as noted concern is especially high among Republicans (83%). Methodology Morning Consult conducted this poll for BPC between April 15-17, 2022, among a sample of 2,004 registered voters. The interviews were conducted online and the data were weighted to approximate a target sample of registered voters based on gender by age, educational attainment, race, marital status, home ownership, race by educational attainment, 2020 presidential vote, and region. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.",

    "content": "It’s not often you get to see a member of Congress and their band in a live performance, but last week in Kissimmee that’s exactly how we kicked off the second American Congressional Exchange trip of 2022. To welcome Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) to Florida’s 9th Congressional District, a couple of members of the Orange Creek Riders played a special acoustic set. Their front man also happens to be Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL), who represents the Orlando-Kissimmee area of central Florida. The two members were paired based on shared interests including education, innovation, military, and veterans&#8217; issues. Rep. Gonzales also has many ties to Florida—his wife is a Floridian, and he was stationed there while in the Navy. To get a real sense of any congressional district in less than 24 hours takes a packed schedule, and this central Florida district is no exception. In just one day, the congressmen met with many local and state leaders to hear how various federal policies and investments are being put to work on the ground. Leaders from Dundee Citrus Growers Association reported on the impact of pests and the slowed supply chain on Florida’s famous citrus. Leaders from Amtrak, SunRail, and the Orlando International Airport offered insight into how people get to, from, and around the rapidly growing Orlando-Kissimmee area. A helicopter tour of the Northern Everglades brought to life federal investments in an ambitious ecosystem restoration effort by the South Florida Water Management District. As Rep. Soto shared during the visit, “Investing funding in the northern Everglades is one thing, to see it on paper or see it in a film &#8230; it&#8217;s totally different when you’re up in a helicopter and you see the great work of your committee to restore an ecosystem.” Perhaps the most moving stop was with staff and patients at the Lake Nona Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where Rep. Gonzales presented both Rep. Soto and Medical Center Director Timothy Cooke with challenge coins, a military tradition recognizing special guests and achievements. While the two members and their districts have many differences—not least of which is size, with Texas’ 23rd Congressional District stretching 800 miles west from San Antonio and including nearly 1,000 miles of the Rio Grande River and almost half of the U.S.-Mexico border—Rep. Gonzales remarked that “Texas and Florida have a whole lot in common.” On the value of visiting Florida’s 9th Congressional District with a member from the other party, he said “we all represent our districts, we’re proud of our districts, but it is something to see &#8230; partnerships at work too. This is how America works, by coming together, rolling up our sleeves, getting away from the partisanship and the rhetoric.” Both members are looking forward to a reciprocal trip to Texas’ 23rd District later this year.

    "content": "Establishing a comprehensive strategy for natural gas network decarbonization can be instrumental to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and would provide stakeholders time to plan for the long-term. Abandoning gas infrastructure, as some critics of natural gas are advocating, would actually delay the achievement of net-zero and increase the costs of the transition significantly. On March 29, the BPC Energy Program hosted an event with industry specialists in energy supply and proliferation to discuss how natural gas networks remain in play today and in the future. It featured opening remarks from House Committee on Energy and Commerce member Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA) followed by a panel discussion with Maryam Brown, President of SoCalGas, Joseph Hezir, Principal and Executive Vice President of Energy Futures Initiative, and Ralph Cavanagh, Energy Co-Director of the Climate &amp; Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. While expansion of natural gas production and distribution is necessary in the short- and medium-term for U.S. energy security and geopolitical reasons, transitioning to renewables is critical to reach net-zero by 2050, as highlighted by Rep. Peters. The congressman emphasized the importance of regulation of our extensive natural gas networks and natural gas production. During his chat with BPC’s Executive Director of the Energy Program Sasha Mackler, Rep. Peters explained how liquid natural gas (LNG) infrastructure provides a blueprint for potential alternative fuel use and proliferation, including hydrogen and biofuels, as this network can be transitioned to carry renewable fuels. The need to manage carbon dioxide and methane emissions in the near future demonstrates a clear incentive to develop carbon capture and sequestration technologies and performance-based methane controls. With natural gas consumption needing to decline gradually, the panel discussed how clean technologies can fill the void in the energy mix. Brown stressed the importance of ambitious clean energy projects like Angeles Link, which will provide the Los Angeles area with massive amounts of zero-emissions, renewable fuel and electricity through solar, wind, and green hydrogen. Understanding the logistics and management of modern pipeline networks is integral to future deployment of net-zero projects. Cavanagh and Hezir highlighted the need to speed up and streamline the permitting process so that other necessary infrastructure projects like Angeles Link will be up and running fast enough to contribute to the net-zero transition.",

    "content": "It will be impossible to hit net-zero by 2050 unless we build a staggering amount of decarbonizing infrastructure and build it quickly. Every delay on a new solar farm, wind turbine, advanced nuclear reactor, carbon capture facility, transmission line, or direct air capture facility (just to name a few) means more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and makes achieving our climate goals more difficult. Our environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), are crucial to protecting our environment, but the bureaucracy involved in implementing them unnecessarily delays important projects that would advance our climate goals. The Biden administration wants to both successfully implement the landmark Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—a new source of billions of federal dollars to support the construction of decarbonizing infrastructure—and to make progress against climate change. To achieve those goals, they must significantly improve our permitting regulatory system. There is simply no time to waste. This week, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the federal agency responsible for NEPA implementation, published its “Phase 1” final rule, revising regulations implementing NEPA. The Phase 1 rule reverses some of the changes made by the Trump administration in 2020 and restores much of NEPA’s prior regulatory framework. Generally, the Biden administration’s approach will steer federal agencies to carry out more complex environmental reviews. While thorough scrutiny for legitimate, detrimental environmental effects such as climate impact is important, these changes can also slow federal review and approval of important infrastructure projects. Here are some key Biden administration changes in the Phase 1 final rule that meaningfully depart from the Trump administration’s 2020 revision and their potential impact: 1. It removes the requirement to weigh the goals of project applicants. The “purpose and need” section is the part of an environmental impact statement that outlines why an agency action is proposed and the need it serves. Trump administration CEQ rule: The 2020 rule required agencies considering project applications, including those for permits or licenses, to base the purpose and need section of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the goals of a project applicant and the agency’s authority. This change was designed to align agency goals with the project sponsor goal. Biden administration CEQ rule: The new rule eliminates the sentence requiring agencies to consider the goals of an applicant and an agency’s authority, stating that agencies have the authority to consider a wider range of factors. 2. It allows agencies to develop review procedures beyond CEQ’s rules. While CEQ regulates the broader procedures all agencies must follow while implementing NEPA, each agency incorporates CEQ’s rules into its own implementing regulations which address their own, agency-specific regulations. Trump administration CEQ rule: The 2020 rule prohibited agencies from going beyond NEPA review procedures for NEPA implementation. It also required agencies to eliminate any of their own existing procedures that went beyond CEQ’s NEPA provisions. Biden administration CEQ rule: The new rule eliminates this prohibition—which the Biden administration calls “ceiling requirements”—and allows agencies to develop procedures beyond CEQ’s requirements to&hellip;",

    "content": "The Brief HUD’s Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) has provided rental assistance and housing counseling to displaced households in the wake of past disasters. Yet in recent years, the federal government has not utilized the program, relying instead on FEMA assistance that, some argue, has not adequately and effectively helped vulnerable disaster survivors secure housing. This blog provides an overview of DHAP and highlights how the program, or other HUD initiatives, could enhance federal disaster relief efforts. Background DHAP was established in response to Hurricane Katrina to supplement FEMA’s housing assistance programs. The program supports displaced, low-income disaster victims with vouchers to cover the cost of rent for new housing as well as case-management services. Specifically, the vouchers initially cover the entire cost of market-rate units, with support decreasing over time and ending after a maximum three years, depending on the rules set for the specific disaster response. Local public housing authorities help evacuees receiving DHAP assistance find permanent housing. HUD can only administer DHAP when FEMA authorizes its use through an interagency agreement, as only FEMA has statutory authority to provide post-disaster housing relief. Since 2013, FEMA has declined to implement DHAP, relying instead on its own programs for longer-term rental assistance, which it claimed were more efficient and cost-effective: Individuals and Households Program: Includes rental assistance and direct housing placements, including apartments and manufactured housing. Transitional Sheltering Assistance: When the scale of a disaster is expected to result in extended displacement of survivors, states can request that FEMA authorize TSA to provide additional shelter—mostly hotel and motel rooms—with the goal of transitioning victims from emergency shelter to permanent housing. Such housing is made available for 30 to 180 days. However, a 2020 GAO report found that FEMA could not support its claims of greater efficiency because it does not collect data on administrative costs in a way that allows it to evaluate the entire cost of providing assistance. FEMA has agreed to implement GAO’s recommendations to improve the data it collects on administering its post-disaster rental assistance programs. A DHS Inspector General report issued in February 2021 also found inefficiencies in the TSA program’s response to the 2017 California wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. In particular, the IG found that FEMA lacked sufficient oversight to prevent fraud and waste, failing to verify the accuracy of hotel records and taxes and paying for unoccupied hotel rooms. Housing advocates have argued that contracts for hotel accommodations under TSA are significantly more expensive than administering DHAP vouchers. FEMA’s recent post-disaster housing efforts have not adequately helped families secure stable housing FEMA’s IHP program has not proven to facilitate long-term housing stability on its own. After all, DHAP was first established as a pilot when Hurricane Katrina overwhelmed FEMA’s assistance programs—even though DHAP-Katrina did not launch until two years after the hurricane, FEMA referred over 45,000 households into the program. A GAO report from 2009 found that, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA struggled to transition displaced families into permanent&hellip;",

    "content": "The current exodus of Ukrainians into Europe in the wake of the Russian invasion of their country ranks as one of the worst refugee crises in modern times. And so far, Ukrainian refugees have been met by an outpouring of support in Europe and some other countries. However, as we examine in this paper, whether migrants receive welcome, and for how long, varies based on context, geography, and numerous other factors. There are certainly some unique aspects to the current Ukraine crisis. The number of Ukrainian refugees now numbers more than 5 million in the two months since the invasion, with the UN high commissioner for refugees warning that it could become “Europe’s largest refugee crisis this century.” It could also be the fastest. For comparison, during the last European refugee crisis from 2015 to 2016, nearly 5.2 million refugees arrived from the Middle East and North Africa over two years. The majority of Ukrainian refugees has fled to Poland, which has encouraged this, saying anyone from Ukraine is allowed visa-free entry and receiving refugees at nine reception centers. Volunteers have flocked to major receiving cities offering assistance. Yet Poland is already strained, with some shelters near the border restricting how long refugees can stay and reports that the government is relying mostly on an overextended network of nonprofit groups for critical support. There have also been troubling reports of racism, particularly at the Polish border. In contrast, in the Americas, with millions of arriving asylum-seekers over the last several years, the U.S. and Mexico have taken strong measures to deter or prevent migrants from arriving at the border. This group mostly comes from the Western hemisphere, but some Ukrainian refugees who made their way to the U.S.-Mexico border have also been denied entry. Below we look at various regions that have faced refugee and asylum influxes, their responses, and the different degrees of welcome or rebuff they have received. Europe Though many people have rightfully pointed out that Ukrainian refugees are facing a much warmer welcome than Syrians and other Middle Eastern and North African refugees received during the 2015 migration crisis, many then were initially welcomed in scenes similar to Ukrainian refugees. In late 2015, volunteers and cheering crowds greeted refugees at train stations in Germany and volunteers gathered on Greek beaches to provide aid to exhausted families arriving from Turkey. But the welcome was uneven from the start, with Hungary constructing a fence to keep out migrants and Poland refusing to take the quota of refugees suggested by the European Union under its Temporary Protection Directive. The welcome continued to falter as European nations disagreed on how to best share responsibility for the crisis, and in January 2016, the sexual attacks in Cologne, Germany on New Year’s Eve led to rising anti-immigrant sentiment in that country. Seeking refuge in Europe became increasingly difficult for Syrians, and over the next few years they faced harsher and more hostile treatment. Several decades earlier, in the early 1990s, Europe faced&hellip;",

    "content": "1. Enact a gasoline tax holiday. In early February, a group of Democratic Senators led by Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) introduced S. 3609 to suspend the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal excise tax on gasoline from the date of enactment through December 31, 2022. The idea has since gained some traction—a companion bill, H.R. 6787, was introduced in the House, six Democratic governors released a letter of support, and a handful of states have advanced proposals to suspend their own state gas taxes. Our view: Suspending the federal gas tax would provide negligible relief to drivers, while undermining the Highway Trust Fund. A federal gas tax holiday has limited value as a short-term remedy to high gas prices. Combined federal and state gas taxes amount to only 15% of retail gas prices. Moreover, a gas tax holiday does not target—and might even exacerbate—the structural causes of rising gas prices. Currently, the United States’ constrained supply is unable to meet increasing demand for gasoline as the nation recovers from the pandemic—and a federal gas tax holiday could further boost demand. When states individually implement state-level gas tax holidays, lower prices could increase vehicle use within the state, boosting total national demand and raising prices only for drivers outside the state who do not benefit from the gas tax holiday. In addition to doing little to reduce gas prices, a gas tax holiday would exacerbate the long-term insolvency of the Highway Trust Fund, which supports the construction and maintenance of the nation’s highway and transit systems. Even with funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the HTF faces a structural funding gap, with dedicated revenue from gas taxes decreasing as cars become more efficient. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the proposed gas tax holiday would reduce federal revenues by $20 billion. 2. Boost domestic oil supply. The Biden administration authorized three releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve—the national stockpile of crude oil— to make up for oil imports banned from Russia and soften the resulting gasoline price increases in the United States. In November 2021, President Biden first authorized the release of 50 million barrels and, along with 30 other countries, the U.S. released 30 million barrels following the start of the war in Ukraine. In late March, the administration authorized an additional 1 million barrels to be released per day over the next six months for a total up to 180 million barrels, in concert with releases from the International Energy Agency states of 60 million barrels. Our view: SPR releases will have a modest impact on gasoline prices and are not a durable solution. The SPR is not designed to address short-term, non-emergency impacts but is designed to be used in extreme emergency situations when there is an “energy supply shortage of significant scope or duration; and action taken would assist directly and significantly in preventing or reducing the adverse impact of such shortage.&#8221; In addition, it may be expensive to replace&hellip;",

    "content": "The federal government is a major source of funding for numerous programs implemented at the state level: infrastructure, education, health care, social programs, and so on. Congress often uses these funds to incentivize certain state policies. One common way the federal government does this is with maintenance of effort (MOE) provisions, which make federal funds contingent on states maintaining or improving on a status quo in regulations or spending. Indeed, during the COVID-19 pandemic, new federal funding to support state education systems included an MOE provision. Specifically, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act required states to maintain spending on K-12 and postsecondary education at or above the average level of their previous three fiscal years to receive federal COVID relief funds, with a provision that the Secretary of Education could waive that requirement for states experiencing a “precipitous decline” in financial resources. The American Rescue Plan Act contained a similar provision. Recently, eight states and Puerto Rico formally requested an exemption from the MOE provisions for education funding they received through federal COVID-19 relief. The purpose of some MOE provisions is to ensure that state governments do not replace their own programmatic spending with federal funds, as doing so would not actually be increasing the total funds available for a program as intended. In 2020, the Bipartisan Policy Center proposed a flexible federal block grant to states, with up to $5 billion in annual federal spending to be devoted to state-level college affordability policies and programs. The proposed approach included an MOE provision: in order to incentivize states to maintain previous spending on higher education while also increasing their spending on affordability, states would need to maintain previous spending as well as partially match new federal funding. MOE provisions can be constructed in multiple ways. For instance, MOEs in higher education can be based on either aggregate dollars or per-student spending. They may be based on the previous year’s spending or the average of the previous two or three years of spending. Another area of complexity lies in crafting federal-state partnerships that are intended to sustain funding through economic downturns. During a recession, state revenues typically decrease along with economic activity and wages. Unlike the federal government, many states also have balanced budget requirements, meaning they cannot spend more than they collect in revenues each year. MOE provisions that fail to recognize these acute budget pressures could mean the loss of federal support just when states need it most. As such, MOE provisions should be flexible during economic downturns—one example is the “precipitous decline” exemption in the COVID-relief legislation noted above. But a more proactive way for federal-state financing partnerships to plan for recessions is through the creation of rainy-day funds that assist states in maintaining funding at previous levels despite spending cuts. BPC has proposed the creation of such funds to help states weather recessions without any loss in total funding for higher education programs. Crafting MOE provisions in ways that ensure states do not cut&hellip;",

Campus Happenings Moderator Denounces Law School Protesters In Faculty-wide Memo Philip Mousavizadeh | Yale Daily News | April 4, 2022 More than 100 students disrupted a Yale Law School Federalist Society panel on free speech and civil liberties leading the speakers to pause their remarks. The Yale Law School dean sent a message rebuking the protestors but said they had not violated university policy; the professor who moderated that panel disagreed in a memo to the university’s tenured law faculty accusing the students of violating Yale’s free speech policy. Oberlin College Loses Appeal Against $25 Million Libel Judgement from Suit Filed by Local Bakery Mark Gillispie | USA Today | April 4, 2022 An Ohio appeals court has upheld a 2019 ruling that Oberlin College must pay nearly $32 million to a bakery libeled by the college with unfounded accusations of racism following a shoplifting incident. The college suspended its relationship with the bakery, supported protests outside the bakery, and displayed a student senate resolution critical of the bakery’s owners. At University of Virginia, Mike Pence Event Reignites A Debate Over Free Speech Susan Svrluga| The Washington Post | April 11, 2022 A student group’s invitation to former Vice President Mike Pence spurred a debate about the bounds of campus speech. A student editorial called for the event to be cancelled; some faculty wrote in support of allowing the event while others wrote in opposition. The university’s president and provost wrote that the debate over the speech shows the exchange of ideas “is alive and well” and that campus members should “strive to be both empathetic speakers and generous listeners.” The speech went ahead without disruption. Federal and State College Officials Can Be Personally Liable for Firing Professor in Free Speech Case, Judge Rules Greg Piper | Just the News | March 16, 2022 A U.S. district judge in Texas ruled public university officials can be held personally liable after they declined to renew the contract of a contingent faculty member following a controversial message he penned on a faulty lounge chalkboard. Other recent cases have found public university officials can be held personally liable in instances where they have restricted speech or funding for certain clubs. Ohio Legislature Sends Sweeping Higher Ed Bill to DeWine Zachary Jarrell | The News Record| April 12, 2022 The Ohio State Legislature passed S.B. 135, which will “require public universities and community colleges to create a formal complaint system for students and faculty to submit free speech violations.” The bipartisan bill received only one “nay” vote; Gov.

    "content": "“The U.S. is going to have its lunch eaten if it doesn’t wake up soon.” That was the blunt assessment of one participant in the 2022 Global Entrepreneurship Congress (GEC), which took place at the end of March in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The GEC annually brings together entrepreneurs, investors, startup programs, entrepreneurship organizations, policymakers, and more from nearly 200 countries. This was the first in-person GEC since 2019. The participant quoted above was responding specifically to the Ministerial session, during which senior policymakers from several dozen countries discussed what their governments were doing to support entrepreneurs. As the observation indicates, this year’s GEC was a good place for considering the United States’ place not only in the world economy but also in the realm of global innovation. This is also on the minds of American lawmakers as the U.S. House and Senate move into a formal legislative conference on two major pieces of legislation that purport to boost U.S. competitiveness and innovation. Three takeaways from the 2022 GEC should be kept in mind by U.S. policymakers as they seek to resolve legislative differences and get a final competitiveness bill to the president’s desk. Entrepreneurs are Everywhere And they’re doing amazing things. Words like “entrepreneur” and “startup” often get closely associated with locations such as Silicon Valley and Kendall Square. In the 2021 Global Startup Ecosystem Report from Startup Genome, U.S. regions held five of the top 10 spots in overall ecosystem rankings. The United States, however, does not have a monopoly on startups. Rarely does discussion of entrepreneurship call to popular mind places like Uzbekistan or Bangladesh—but entrepreneurs are there. A small sampling of startups at the GEC found entrepreneurs working on soil re-naturalization with bacteria; SMS-based education modules; executive search using artificial intelligence; and non-fungible tokens for, well, everything. The United States used to be a priority destination for entrepreneurs from around the world. Now, more of them are staying put to help address challenges and take advantage of opportunities in their home countries. Governments are Doing a Lot to Support Entrepreneurship There is considerable debate over the proper role of government in helping, or at least not hindering, entrepreneurs. For some, government should be active, putting money into public venture funds and supporting all manner of business assistance programs. For others, government’s best role is to keep barriers to market entry low and fund basic research that entrepreneurs can commercialize. Irrespective of their philosophical starting points, it’s clear from GEC that more and more governments are determined to cultivate vibrant entrepreneurial environments. In some countries, it’s an existential matter. The host nation, Saudi Arabia, has been pouring billions into supporting entrepreneurs in an attempt to diversify away from oil. To the north, Iraq faces the same situation. At the Ministerial, a senior government official said that 95% of the Iraqi government’s revenues currently come from oil. Supporting entrepreneurs is an economic survival strategy. Elsewhere, entrepreneurship support is a means for economic reinvigoration. European governments have long fretted about&hellip;",

While restrained by some statutory duties and obligations, the role of FHFA Director includes substantial administrative authorities as both regulator and conservator of the GSEs, the exercise of which often directly affect housing access and affordability. To better understand plans and priorities for the agency, BPC’s J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy hosted What’s Next for FHFA: A Fireside Chat with Acting Director Sandra L. Thompson last month. Sandra Thompson was appointed Acting Director of FHFA in June 2021 and later nominated by President Biden in December 2021 to serve as the agency’s next Director.

    "content": "America’s underproduction of housing is so severe, companies of all sizes are beginning to take notice and act. Fast-rising housing costs in communities across the country increasingly prevent companies from recruiting top talent, particularly in some of America’s most economically vibrant, thriving, and well-resourced metros. This blog—as well as the Terwilliger Center’s next webinar in our housing supply series—explores how companies are approaching and promoting housing affordability for their workforces and in their communities. Though not an exhaustive list of the actions being taken to build more affordable housing, these examples show the many ways in which the private sector can help address this pressing national concern. Amazon: Amazon has created a Housing Equity Fund, guided by the belief that “ll people should have access to housing they can afford.” As the company noted in the fund’s mission statement, “hile only governments at the local, state, and federal level have the capacity to implement more effective housing policies, we believe the private and public sectors can work together to address this challenge.” Amazon, much like Apple, is concentrating its efforts and investments where the company has a physical presence and sizable workforce—namely Seattle, WA; Arlington, VA; and Nashville, TN. Amazon has pledged more than $2 billion to help respond to the affordable housing challenges in these areas specifically, and throughout the country more generally. To date, Amazon has established 20 partnerships with nonprofits, public housing agencies, and affordable housing developers, in addition to allocating more than $1.2 billion in loan and grant commitments to bolster the supply of affordable homes. In this way the company is investing both directly in housing—such as the development of an eight-floor, $100 million homeless shelter in Seattle—as well as indirectly— via their commitment to increase the number of minority real estate developers through training and mentorship initiatives. Apple: In late 2019, Apple pledged $2.5 billion in funding to strengthen affordable housing initiatives across California, home to the tech-giant’s international headquarters. Like most states in the nation, California faces a worrying lack of affordable and available homes. In 2019, 59% of California’s 5.9 million renter households were burdened by housing costs, spending upwards of 30% of their incomes on rent and utilities. As the most populous state in the Union, California also has the largest homeless population in the nation. To address the deficit of affordable and available homes, Apple has committed itself to a multifaceted strategy aimed at alleviating housing cost burdens broadly across the state. Of the $2.5 billion committed, Apple plans to allocate $1 billion to an “affordable housing investment fund” in partnership with the California state government, $1 billion to a first-time homebuyers mortgage assistance fund, and $200 million to increasing the supply of affordable homes throughout Silicon Valley. Other initiatives include assistance for homeless populations throughout the state, and the opening of Apple-owned land to be used for affordable housing projects in the future.

    "content": "To address climate change the United States needs to build out low- and zero-carbon infrastructure, including grid-scale batteries, carbon capture retrofits, electric vehicles and associated charging stations, wind turbines, and new power electronics that make the electric grid function more effectively. These clean infrastructure components require vast amounts of raw materials for which the United States is largely import-dependent. As we have seen from the recent invasion of Ukraine, relying on countries like Russia and China for these materials as well as the processing and manufacturing of the components creates significant national security and environmental concerns. The Energy Act of 2020 (EA20) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) together set the United States on a course to significantly strengthen our domestic supply chains for clean energy materials. In the coming months, BPC will be exploring further policy steps that could be taken to enhance our national security and meet our decarbonization goals. While lists for critical minerals have been developed in the years since a 2008 National Academies Report on the topic, the EA20 formally defines a process for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to regularly publish a critical minerals list, along with the criteria for their selection. Critical materials was also defined by the EA20 to include all of the critical minerals as well as any non-fuel material that the energy secretary determines to: (1) have a high risk of a supply chain disruption; and (2) serve an essential function for energy technologies. This broad definition for critical materials allows flexibility for the Department of Energy to address energy supply chain concerns that go beyond the process required for designating new critical minerals at USGS. Out of 50 critical minerals published in the USGS’s 2022 critical minerals list, the United States is 100% import-reliant on 10 minerals, and more than 50% import-reliant on 31 additional minerals. A first step to reducing our dependence on foreign supply chains is to fully understand the potential for domestic production of these critical resources—a task that was loosely included in the original charter for the USGS in 1879. Geologic mapping and resource assessments have significantly ramped up over the past few decades, through programs like the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping (NCGM) Program, the U.S. Mineral Deposit Database, and the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation (NGGDP) Program, which produce and aggregate geologic maps and catalog historical samples. The IIJA reauthorizes and strengthens these existing programs, as well as formalizes a new Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI) at USGS to accelerate our understanding of domestic critical mineral deposits. The Earth MRI program is tasked with producing a comprehensive mapping of domestic mineral resources within 10 years. Anticipating demand for certain materials and progress toward future domestic production is an essential component to ensuring energy security and economic prosperity. To this end, the EA20 requires the USGS to produce an Annual Critical Minerals Outlook each year, similar to the DOE Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook that forecasts future energy use&hellip;",

Starting July 16, 2022, individuals will only need to dial 9-8-8—the brand new, three-digit number for mental health emergencies—to access crisis counseling services. However, few states and localities are ready for what is expected to be a surge of demand for services: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) estimates that calls to 9-8-8 will be roughly twice that of calls currently coming into the Lifeline, and that the increased demand will also produce a wider variety of behavioral health needs. Behavioral health crises can affect anyone, at any time, and without adequate federal and state coordination, individuals in crisis may find themselves calling a lifeline that cannot meet their immediate needs. Too often, these crises are met with delay, detainment, and even denial of service. That can cause diversion of these individuals to emergency departments , law enforcement officials and other first responders who may be underprepared in behavioral health response, and local justice departments. That is why the launch of 9-8-8 is such a critical step toward building the infrastructure needed to ensure that people in crisis can receive the services that address their mental health needs beyond the moment of crisis. As the Lifeline transitions to 9-8-8, the nature of patient needs from those calls will shift and produce a higher demand for core services across a crisis continuum of care comprised of: regional crisis call centers accepting all calls and dispatching support based on the assessed need of the caller 24/7 mobile crisis teams dispatched to wherever the need is in the community (not hospital emergency departments) 23-hour crisis receiving and stabilization facilities that serve everyone that comes through their doors from all referral sources Against this backdrop, the Bipartisan Policy Center has been preparing policy recommendations to optimize the federal government’s role in the behavioral health crisis response system. These recommendations will be featured in an upcoming report to be released in May 2022, before 9-8-8 becomes operational nationwide. Overall, these recommendations will target the structures that comprise the nation’s existing crisis response system and will place a particular focus on rural communities, which are especially under-resourced. In particular, the recommendations will focus on enhanced federal support for the crisis response continuum across three distinct policy areas: implementation, workforce development, and financing. Implementation: To ensure that the services delivered match the needs of patients in crisis, implementation is critical. This subset of recommendations will focus on the federal government’s role in bolstering the continuum of care. They highlight the federal government’s role in assisting states—which have the most influence over the continuum of care—to both strengthen and standardize their crisis response systems, while encouraging trust and utilization among the general population. These recommendations will also suggest data sets which can be used to enhance surveillance and program evaluation.   Workforce: In recognizing the ongoing behavioral health provider shortage, this set of recommendations will focus&hellip;",

    "content": "Although a ~3,000-page climate report written by scientists from around the world is undoubtedly not light reading, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change contains a treasure trove of information that we at BPC will continue to sift through for months. But right away, three excerpts from the IPCC’s headline statements stand out for us as notable for their strong conclusions that bolster the evidence base for BPC’s policy priorities regarding natural climate solutions, carbon dioxide removal, and technology innovation. At the same time, however, the new report continues to make clear that no one set of strategies will be the silver bullet and that the next decade is crucial for getting on a net-zero emissions pathway. AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced removals. The IPCC’s assessment of pathways to global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions provides the strongest evidence yet that the lands sector is a key contributor to cost-effective mitigation. Scientists are learning from years of research into Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) strategies—also known as natural climate solutions—for increasing the amount of carbon stored in plants, trees, and soils, and reducing emissions from agriculture and forestry. The IPCC finds that a lack of financing and technical know-how are important barriers to large-scale implementation and that carbon storage reversal risks (i.e., carbon being re-released back into the atmosphere) must be managed. On balance, though, reaching global net-zero emissions will not be possible without contributions from agriculture, forestry, and lands. BPC has identified a comprehensive set of policy recommendations addressing financial, technical assistance, and R&amp;D barriers facing a rapid scale-up of natural climate solutions in the United States. Policy priorities include voluntary and incentive-based programs for private working lands, together with climate-focused public lands management. Smart federal investments can seed transformational private investment in our agricultural and forestry sectors, providing new revenue streams to American farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners while delivering valuable co-benefits in terms of wildlife habitat, recreation amenities, and air and water quality, and increased resilience to the damaging effects of climate change itself. The deployment of CDR to counterbalance hard-to-abate residual emissions is unavoidable if net-zero CO2 or GHG emissions are to be achieved. For the first time, the IPCC has unequivocally concluded that carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be required to achieve net-zero emissions. CDR refers to human activities to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and durably store it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. CDR is described as achieving “negative emissions” that can balance out the positive side of the emissions ledger to reach an overall level of net-zero emissions. CDR will be necessary for three primary reasons over different timeframes: (1) in the near term (e.g., in the next decade), it reduces net emissions and can help get the world on a realistic pathway to net-zero; (2) in the medium term (e.g., by 2050), it offsets “hard-to-abate residual emissions,” which are the remaining sources of greenhouse gases&hellip;",

We are encouraged to see several of the recommendations put forth by the Task Force reflected in federal actions by Congress and the administration, including the recently released “USDA Actions on Nutrition Security.”",

    "content": "Presidents are required both by the Constitution and more specifically by the Congressional Budget Act to submit their budget blueprint in the spring for a forthcoming fiscal year. President Biden met that statutory requirement by submitting his budget last week. Does it matter? An old congressional staff joke goes, “The president’s thick budget makes a great door stopper.” A little harsh, but not without some truth particularly in this chaotic, uncertain spring. A war in Europe, a stubborn, hard to predict virus, rising interest rates and general inflation at a 40-year high, and a midterm election that could and most likely will change the makeup of the U.S. Congress all combine to make producing a budget nearly six months out from the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year nigh near impossible. Nevertheless, it can be argued that if ever there were a need for a federal fiscal blueprint, however questionable its implementation, it is now more than ever. On at least an annual basis the 50 states, millions of families, businesses, farms, colleges, and universities, put pencil to paper and figure out how they will balance their expenditures with their income. Uncertain times put a premium on planning, and the federal government should not be exempt. A year ago, President Biden’s first budget submission expected federal spending would reach $6 trillion and revenues $4.2 trillion, with a $1.8 trillion deficit. Now with almost three-quarters of the fiscal year over, budget experts forecast final spending will be nearly $500 billion less and revenues $200 billion more, and therefore, a deficit $700 billion less than what was initially proposed. Obviously, the president’s stalled Build Back Better plan explains a significant portion of the reduced spending, but also stronger than expected economic growth has resulted in greater revenues. In addition, the president’s economic forecast foretold 2022 inflation slightly over 2%, and the 10-year Treasury note at 1.4%. Today, a consensus of nearly 50 leading business economists expect inflation to average over 6% and the 10-year Treasury note to be double the forecasted level. The lesson: the president’s second budget numbers will also not turn out as planned. In part, due to failure to achieve his proposed legislative agenda, offset by unexpected emergencies, possible cyber-attacks, untold natural disasters, additional military and humanitarian support for Ukraine, not to mention the inability to accurately forecast a volatile domestic and global economy. If only interest rates were adjusted to the new reality of today, and as economists like to say, “ceteris paribus” (all other things remaining unchanged) the federal deficit would increase nearly $150 billion this year and over $1.5 trillion over the next decade. This should be the focus of the president’s budget submission, not in the short term but in the long term. The question to be addressed, is the federal government’s long-term fiscal blueprint sustainable? The late Herb Stein, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the early 1970’s, was known for his quip, “if something cannot go on forever, it&hellip;",

The conversation focused on how college leaders foster a culture of open inquiry while addressing the perceived tension between diversity, equity, inclusion, and free expression. While acknowledging there are no simple solutions, panelists offered strategies to address this tension, including incorporating the report’s tabletop exercises into leadership, staff, and faculty meetings and retreats; affirming student athletes’ free speech rights while preparing them for the attention—both positive and hostile—their speech may garner; and programming to build professors’ classroom skills for teaching fraught topics. The session also featured a lively Q&amp;A. Answering a question about claims that some speech makes the campus unsafe, Crutcher noted, “You have to differentiate physical safety from intellectual safety. You don’t go to college and university to be intellectually safe&#8230; and that means that you’re going to come up against some ideas that are going to rattle you. And our job is to help you learn how to deal with being rattled and to get over that.” Watch the panel with your SXSW EDU 2022 credential or After Pass available here. Or read the report here.   ",

The competitiveness legislation currently under consideration is a significant opportunity to build on these successes by making additional investments in resilient energy supply chains, regional innovative communities, public-private partnerships, and the basic science underpinning energy technologies. Additional clean energy will be critical to widespread decarbonization technology implementation, which will help mitigate climate change, increase our global competitiveness, and bolster national security. “If you step back, big picture, this is about competitiveness and harnessing the talent of our researchers, our entrepreneurs, and financial markets to ensure that we win this century. As a subset of that, one area that we have designated as a key area of applied research&#8230; will be advanced energy technologies… We all understand that these other technologies will become cost-effective at the consumer level, and we want to lead the way in the development of these technologies.” Sen.

    "content": "As businesses seek ways to compete for workers in a tight labor market and counter the “she-cession,” a business tax credit can help employers provide paid family and medical leave and bolster their benefits package for working parents and caregivers. Originally enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and available through 2025, the Section 45S Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave is designed to cover up to 25% of the cost to employers of providing paid family and medical leave and help expand access to the benefit. Scope and Eligibility Employers of any size can claim this non-refundable paid leave tax credit. To qualify, employers must have an active written policy providing all eligible employees access to at least two weeks of paid family and medical leave annually, paid at 50% or more of normal wages. Employers who provide short-term disability policies that fulfill the credit’s requirements qualify for the credit. The benefit that employers offer must cover leave for at least one of the following reasons: To care for a newborn child, newly adopted child, or newly placed foster child; To care for a spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition; To recover from a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform their job; For any qualifying exigency due to an employee’s spouse, child, or parent being on covered active duty (or having been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Armed Forces; or To care for a service member who is the employee’s spouse, child, parent, or next of kin. Employers can claim the credit for up to 12 weeks of paid leave benefits. The credit only applies to paid leave benefits used by full- or part-time employees who have worked for the employer for at least one year and who earned no more than $78,000 in 2021. The $78,000 earnings threshold is equivalent to 60% of the “highly compensated employee” limit ($130,000 in 2021), which periodically increases with cost of living adjustments. To be eligible for the tax credit, employers must offer paid leave benefits to all workers who meet eligibility requirements. They can use “any reasonable method” to calculate normal wages for the purpose of determining employee eligibility and the amount of the paid leave benefit. To be eligible for the credit, employers must also include specific non-discrimination language in their written policy, as well as “non-interference” language (specifying that the employer will not interfere with any attempt to use the benefits outlined in the policy) for any employees not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. Parameters and Size of the Tax Credit For eligible employers, the tax credit offsets 12.5% to 25% of the cost of wages paid to employees on paid leave, depending on the generosity of the benefit. The credit covers 12.5% of paid leave that compensates workers at 50% of their normal earnings. For paid leave benefits with higher wage replacement rates, the&hellip;",

    "content": "Nobody said that a 50-50 split in the Senate would be easy. Democrats currently have the slimmest of majorities in both chambers and a full legislative agenda, meaning every vote counts. Recently, Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) suffered a stroke, which rendered him unable to be present on the Senate floor for votes for about 4 weeks. Can a majority continue to advance its priorities in a 50-50 Senate with one vote absent or does the Senate necessarily come to a screeching halt? There are several strategies available in accordance with rules and precedents to compensate for an absent member. 1) Unanimous Consent Most of the business conducted in the Senate is by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent allows the Senate to operate on the assumption that all members agree to proceed in some manner unless an objection is raised. This prevents all 100 members from having to cast a vote for every action the Senate takes. Unanimous consent can be used for almost anything from procedural matters to passing a measure but if a Senator objects, then the motion fails. In the absence of a member, a Senate Majority Leader might use unanimous consent to act without taking a vote. This would likely have limited applications, however, given that it takes just one member to prevent the action from occurring. Continued use of this approach would require extensive negotiations and concessions with members.  One way unanimous consent works is the Senate &#8220;hotline&#8221;, an informal process in which the party leaders and staff contact each senator’s office in hopes of gaining tacit approval for the use of unanimous consent. The hotline is not enshrined in the Senate rules, but it is a tool sometimes used to bypass procedure.   While unanimous consent is used to resolve many questions on the floor, more contentious legislation is not likely to gain approval this way.   2) Proxy Voting Proxy voting is a method used in some legislative chambers that allows absent members to designate another member who can vote on their behalf. Proxy voting is currently not permitted in the Senate for roll call votes, only during committee business. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Senate searched for ways to continue operating amid social distancing and other health precautions, Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Richard Durbin (D-IL) introduced a resolution allowing the use of proxy voting due to the emergency. The resolution was not agreed to.  While the Senate did not adopt proxy voting, the House reintroduced the practice for the first time since the 1990s and continues using it to this day. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) brought a lawsuit challenging the practice; however, the Supreme Court declined to hear it and the practice remains in place.  The outcome of the lawsuit reaffirms that the chambers have broad authority to set their own rules and procedures should the Senate consider proxy voting in the future.  3) Pairs In the past, when senators have been unable to be present on the&hellip;",

    "content": "Section 230 has proven to be a double-edged sword. On one hand, the liability protections afforded to online intermediaries have played a crucial role in the digitization of the global economy by connecting billions of people online; on the other hand, the unfettered growth of online platforms spurred by IML regimes has contributed to a slew of societal woes ranging from mass disinformation campaigns to mental health crises among teenagers. As demonstrated by the recent revelations brought forward by whistleblowers like former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, the vast protections afforded by Section 230 to giant online platforms like Facebook have allowed them to operate with little oversight, transparency, or accountability. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have grown speculative of Section 230; the former have complained it allows Silicon Valley to deflect responsibility for deceptive practices on their sites while the latter have accused online platforms of abusing their legal protection to censor conservative views. Yet, because Section 230 is so foundational to the entire internet economy ranging from startups to Big Tech firms, simply revoking those protections could cause more harm than good. As such, policymakers, advocates, and academics have sought to address the question of Section 230 reform from several angles.  Potential Consequences of Repealing Section 230  Whether Section 230’s blanket protection was the correct approach to addressing intermediary liability online or not, it does not change the fact that much of the modern internet was built on its back. As such, an outright repeal of Section 230 would likely be chaotic. Without the liability shield, an easy prediction for one of the first major consequences of Section 230’s repeal would be an onslaught of litigation against online platforms. Section 230 is hardly the only legal protection these platforms have against such lawsuits; as mentioned earlier in this series, court cases such as Cubby v. CompuServe sided with online service providers before the IML regime was even established. Future cases handling intermediary liability without Section 230 are likely to evoke First Amendment arguments as well, potentially paving the way for new precedents set by the Supreme Court.   The long, drawn-out cases arising out of Section 230’s repeal could disproportionately affect startup and medium-sized online platforms as well. Currently, cases related to online intermediary liability can often be dismissed early on by invoking Section 230 protections, but without it, court battles – and their associated expenses – could prove disastrous for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) financially, regardless of the merits of the lawsuits.   Repealing Section 230 would also lead to a far more cautious internet and rushed attempts to restrict discourse online. Expect comment sections on many sites to close for fear of what users might put on them as well as frequent outages on services people use on a daily basis – especially on social media – while companies attempt to find ways to minimize risk to themselves. Content moderators on services like video sharing sites might be overzealous in their decision-making process on what to leave up&hellip;",

    "content": "The Child Tax Credit (CTC) provides critical financial support to millions of American families by offsetting the high cost of raising children. While Congress has expanded the CTC numerous times with the support of each administration since its enactment in 1997—most recently through the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and 2021 American Rescue Plan Act—its future continues to be a topic of debate. Understanding parents’ experience with and perception of the credit is vital to ensuring that any policy changes optimize the CTC and effectively support American families.   BPC and Morning Consult conducted a survey of 1,500 parents1 from February 17-22, 2022, to measure awareness of and familiarity with the CTC, understand reactions to temporary changes to the credit for 2021, and identify areas for improving its administration to increase accessibility. This survey expands on BPC’s 2021 report, “How to Sensibly and Permanently Expand the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit,” with key findings highlighted below.   1. The CTC expansion for tax year 2021 significantly impacted families’ finances, and parents continue to feel the effects of the end of monthly CTC payments.    The American Rescue Plan Act (ARP), a broad pandemic relief bill, significantly expanded the CTC for tax year 2021. For one year only, the ARP increased the maximum credit amount to $3,000, introduced a larger credit of up to $3,600 for children ages 5 or younger, raised the maximum age of qualifying children to 17, and eliminated the CTC’s refundability cap and its phase-in, making it fully available to low-income families regardless of earnings. The law also introduced the option for families to receive the CTC monthly instead of in full at tax filing time, with half of the 2021 credit paid out in installments from July to December 2021. For tax year 2022, the CTC has reverted to its previous form, unless Congress takes further action this year.   Nearly two-thirds (63%) of parents who qualified for the CTC in 2021 said that the credit had a large or somewhat large impact on their family’s finances. Low-income parents, Black and Hispanic parents, younger parents, and parents in larger households were particularly likely to report that the CTC had a large impact.   2. While awareness of the CTC is high, administrative challenges prevent some parents from accessing it.   Nearly all parents (87%) said that they are very or somewhat familiar with the CTC. White parents were most likely to be at least somewhat familiar (90%), while Black parents were most likely to be very familiar with the credit (58%). Additionally, high- (93%) and middle-income (90%) parents were more likely to report being familiar with the CTC than were low-income (83%) parents. 3. As policymakers debate future changes to the CTC, they should also focus on efforts to expand public knowledge about the credit, more clearly convey current policy, and enact administrative reforms that make the program easier to navigate for all eligible families.   Our survey results demonstrate that the CTC can have a significant impact&hellip;",

    "content": "The Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022 (SECURE 2.0) would make vital financial tools available to a broader swath of Americans and increase the ability of small businesses to offer competitive benefits to help employees prepare for retirement. Although the bill would benefit from a few changes as it moves through the legislative process, its House passage marks a significant step forward for millions of workers currently without the tools to effectively save for retirement. Bipartisan Progress on Far-Reaching Financial Problems  Congress last acted to strengthen Americans’ retirement security in 2019, when it passed the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act as part of a bipartisan budget deal. Since then, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have continued working to expand access to retirement savings vehicles and support small businesses’ ability to offer competitive financial benefits. That bipartisan momentum led to SECURE 2.0, which now moves to the Senate for consideration.  Most Americans worry about running out of money in retirement, making it one of the top financial concerns across the nation. Projections from the Employee Benefit Research Institute show that 41% of households headed by working-age adults will run short of money in retirement, indicating that this fear is well-founded. And while retirement security is important for all Americans, it is hardest to achieve for low-income workers, those without college degrees, people of color, and single women—groups that often have limited access to both the financial tools and the income required to build robust savings.  The SECURE Act aimed to address these challenges with a host of provisions—many recommended by BPC’s Commission on Retirement Security and Personal Savings—such as reducing barriers for small businesses to offer retirement plans, expanding 401(k) plan eligibility to more part-time workers, and making it easier to include lifetime income options in retirement plans. SECURE 2.0 builds on many of these policies to reach even more Americans. While the SECURE Act allowed small employers to band together to offer better 401(k) plans, for example, SECURE 2.0 extends that ability to nonprofit employers offering 403(b) plans. Amplifying the benefits of expanding access to those plans is a requirement in SECURE 2.0 that most new 401(k) and 403(b) plans automatically enroll eligible participants and automatically escalate their contributions by 1 percentage point (up to 10% of wages) annually. (Participants would retain the ability to opt out.)  Other provisions in SECURE 2.0 extend beyond the purview of the SECURE Act to further strengthen workers’ financial security. In addition to enhancing eligibility for the Saver’s Credit (starting in 2027), which offers tax savings to lower earners who save for retirement, SECURE 2.0 would allow employers to match qualified student loan payments with retirement plan contributions, providing a retirement savings jumpstart to those unable to save due to student debt. Other provisions of the bill would expand the tax credit for small employers that establish retirement plans and provide a new tax credit for small employers that expedite military spouses’ eligibility to participate&hellip;",

Yet there has been chronic underinvestment in mental health supports in the early childhood field.   Research has found a range of negative impacts on children, leading to higher rates of harsh discipline and expulsion, between poor mental health in child care providers and detrimental impacts on children’s learning and development. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act allocated $39 billion dollars in federal relief funding for the child care sector, and although supporting the mental health of children and child care providers is a specific line item in the law, only one state, Ohio, has provided adequate guidance on the use of ARP funds for mental health As states continue to disburse their federal child care dollars and endeavor to solve the child care crisis, provider mental health must be addressed.   The child care workforce is no stranger to work-related stressors, including low pay, limited benefits, high turnover, and providing developmentally appropriate care for 10 or more young children learning essential skills day after day. The compounding effects of these stressors, without a comprehensive plan to support the mental health of providers, has led to concerning rates of mental health issues in the early childhood provider community.   Prior to the onset of the pandemic, 16% to 36% of early childhood educators reported depressive symptoms. The pandemic compounded staff shortages, stress, and burnout among child care providers, and introduced increased and more stringent cleaning demands, additional COVID safety protocols, worries of contracting COVID, and caring for children with social and emotional challenges resulting from pandemic isolation. The impact of increased stress on child care workers has also increased exhaustion, feelings of anxiety, trouble sleeping, substance use, and temper issues, with emotional distress more pronounced for child care providers who dealt with disruptions in the continuity of child care. A new Yale research study, currently under peer review, reports that 66.5% of child care providers are experiencing moderate to high levels of stress and 45.7% of child care professionals screening positive for depression.    Child care providers’ well-being and mental health has an impact on the academic success, behavioral outcomes, and mental health of children in their care. Child care workers who experience high levels of stress and burnout are less able to emotionally attend to children and are associated with high rates of student behavior problems and poor academic achievement. Depressive symptoms in caregivers have been tied to higher reported rates of behavioral problems in children. High levels of stress and depression among educators are also tied to higher levels of harsh discipline and expulsion While there are positive, evidence-based approaches to addressing the mental health crisis among child care workers, there continues to be an underinvestment in programs to help.

    "content": "HUD has allocated all of the $5 billion that Congress appropriated for the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program last September to assist communities affected by disasters in 2020 and 2021 with their long-term recoveries.   While HUD announced recent CDBG-DR grant allocations, on average, 318 days after a disaster was officially declared, these allocations came as quickly as 76 days after a disaster declaration and long as 655 days.   This unevenness has real consequences for disaster recovery efforts but can be addressed through legislative action.  Congress appropriated $5 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program on September 30, 2021 (Public Law 117-43), to address long-term recovery needs arising from major disasters that occurred in 2020 and 2021. This appropriation brought total CDBG-DR funding since 2001 to $95 billion, a significant contribution to recovery from myriad disasters—the September 11 attacks; Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Sandy, Harvey, and Maria; as well as wildfires, tornadoes, and riverine flooding. Of the $5 billion appropriated in September, HUD announced in November that $2 billion would be allocated for disasters that occurred in 2020. However, that allocation occurred more than a year after the qualifying disasters were declared and HUD only issued guidance to govern those funds on February 3, 2022. HUD has since announced its allocations for the remaining $3 billion—$2.214 billion to 10 local governments and 13 state governments for 16 major disasters in 2021 and an additional $722.7 million to five of the previously announced 2020 disaster recovery grants.  For those affected by disasters in 2020, the reality is that this CDBG-DR funding did not become available for 15 to 18 months after the qualifying disasters. This set of circumstances defines the most common criticism of CDBG-DR—namely, that it takes too long to get on the ground and begin addressing post-disaster recovery needs.    The delay grows out of the fact that CDBG-DR is not a permanently authorized program and exists only when Congress appropriates funding, typically in supplemental appropriation after devastating disasters. This situation contrasts with the standing disaster response authorities that fund Federal Emergency Management Agency programs pursuant to the Stafford Act and the disaster loan programs administered by the Small Business Administration.  The lack of predictability surrounding CDBG-DR funding produces a curious equity consideration for disaster survivors from state to state and even within states. Both Michigan and Oregon only recently received allocations for disasters that occurred in the summer of 2020 with a resulting drawn-out recovery timeline. Yet Kentucky and Colorado experienced disaster events in December 2021 and, with HUD’s most recent allocation announcement, have CDBG-DR allocations just three months later.  Bottom line—a broader range of recovery resources will be available more rapidly for survivors in one set of states versus others simply because CDBG-DR is not permanently authorized.  This outcome is even more curious in a state such as Louisiana, where survivors of Hurricane Ida in August-September 2021 will see the benefit of CDBG-DR assistance far sooner than their fellow Louisianans who were impacted by&hellip;",

    "content": "Internationally, content moderation issues are termed intermediary liability regiems.  There are several other countries that maintain intermediary liability (IML) regimes that vary in scope and severity in their definitions of the relationship online platforms have with the users that publish content on their sites. Freedom House reports that at least 48 countries have passed or are considering laws for tech companies around content, data, and competition. With a few exceptions, many of these laws are actually veiled attempts to suppress speech. Overall, these IML regimes tend not to treat the intermediary as a speaker or publisher and instead build frameworks requiring them to remove illegal content when notified. They also follow a trend of governments increasingly pressing intermediaries to block undesirable online content in order to suppress hate speech, privacy violations, terrorism, misinformation, and in some cases government criticism. It is less common for countries to explicitly address the monitoring, filtering, or removal practices of intermediaries regarding non-illegal content as the United States does. In several instances, countries without IML regimes now maintain them as stipulated by free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, in a sense allowing the US to export at least part of its IML model to its allies.  Australia – The 1992 Broadcasting Services Act, predating Section 230, protects internet hosts or ISPs from civil or criminal liability for hosting or transmitting content when unaware of its illegal nature. They are also protected from being compelled to monitor, make inquiries, or keep records of content hosted or transmitted. After an Australian white supremacist perpetrated the 2019 Christchurch mass shooting in New Zealand, the government soon after passed the Criminal Code Amendment (sharing of abhorrent violent material) Bill, making it illegal for social media platforms to fail to expeditiously remove abhorrent violent user material, as defined by the bill, shared on their services.  Canada and Mexico – Article 19.17 of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) stipulates that “no Party shall adopt or maintain measures that treat a supplier or user of an interactive computer service as an information content provider in determining liability” along with other language that closely mirrors Section 230.   India – Section 79 of the Information Technology Act creates a comparatively narrow IML regime for online intermediaries to remove content they might deem harmful but not necessarily unlawful. Online service providers are shielded from liability for the content published by third parties on their platform provided they do not initiate the transmission, select the receiver, select or modify the information contained, and observe due diligence and other guidelines proscribed by the government. The law does establish liability if the intermediary had “actual knowledge” of or did not act expeditiously to remove content related to an illegal act. The Indian Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) updated these rules in February 2021 to introduce a tiered approach that requires intermediaries with over 5 million users to incorporate a company locally, assist the government in tracing unlawful content within 72 hours, trace the original content creator,&hellip;",

I spoke a little about the history of how tech has impacted democracy and what we can learn from that for the next twenty. A huge thank you to everyone that came. For those that couldn’t I wanted to share an excerpt of my presentation as written below.  This year we’ll have elections in the United States, Brazil, Philippines and Kenya among many others. In 2024, the future of the Internet is on the line as the world will see for the first time ever not only a U.S. presidential election, but elections in India, Indonesia, Ukraine, Taiwan, Mexico, potentially the UK and the European Parliament — all around the same time. It’s a huge geopolitical moment for the world where the governments of all those major countries could all change in a very short period of time. Companies, researchers, regulators, the media, the international community and civil society all need to start working together now to start building, learning and iterating on the tools we’ll need to keep those elections free and fair. If we fail, it could set us back decades.   &nbsp; Technology has brought so many good things to our lives. These past two years so many of us would have been a lot more lonely, depressed and bored if we didn’t have technology to keep us connected to friends and family, allow us to keep doing our jobs, watch way too much Netflix and order groceries and many other supplies without ever leaving our homes.   &nbsp; I think technology still has the possibility to bring positive change and engagement to our civic lives. Do we have more work to do on mitigating the harms? Absolutely. But we can also do more to help connect people to their local governments, to restore trust in institutions and bring transparency to the process. We can use the internet and power of friends and influencers to get more people to not only register to vote but actually go and vote in more elections than just for President. Speaking of voting we can find ways to safely expand options for people to vote while protecting against fraud. We’re seeing more young people, people of color, women and many others wanting to run for office. We’re seeing people use the web to shine a light on problems we as a society have ignored for way too long and to organize to demand change. We need to help figure out the future of journalism — especially local journalism — to adapt to the way people consume news now. We need to start teaching kids in elementary school how to not only be productive members of their communities but how to be good digital citizens. We need to do this not only in the U.S. but around the world.  You can read the full remarks and see the slides I made here. ",

Austin was a particularly appropriate setting for this conversation given the rapid growth in the city’s housing prices in recent years that has outpaced much of the country. Each of us brought our own unique experiences in federal and local policymaking to the discussion. We identified three overarching needs that must be met if we are to make progress in addressing the nation’s housing affordability crisis: Increased production of affordable housing  New tools to preserve the existing housing stock  Expanded and reformed rental assistance programs to help individuals and families afford their housing when incomes fall short  While no easy task, our panelists emphasized the importance of layering different kinds of assistance together to adequately meet the needs of our communities. To support households more effectively with available funding and financing—whether tax credits, vouchers, housing trust dollars, or other sources—they also called on states and local communities to update their land use and zoning rules to allow the necessary housing stock to be built. Dana Wade closed with a reminder that “there&#8217;s no silver bullet to fix housing, but there&#8217;s a lot of little bullets and ways we can make a difference.&#8221; If you missed the chance to join us in Austin, please check out the media coverage of the discussion below and our presentation on our housing affordability and supply challenge: Former San Antonio mayor urges new mindset about housing in SXSW panel discussion (Community Impact). Austin&#8217;s housing costs could drive people out, experts at SXSW say (Austin Statesman). Austin’s housing shortage hitting breaking point, SXSW panel finds (The Real Deal).",

Jacobs and Meijer are both alumni of BPC’s American Congressional Exchange program, which gives Republican and Democrat members of Congress the opportunity to visit each other’s districts to find common ground away from Washington. We covered a broad array of topics, including the war in Ukraine as both are members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Jacobs was quick to point out that, “There’s broad bipartisan unification around Ukraine. You can see that from the omnibus bill that just passed,” and Rep Meijer noted, “What Putin wants more than anything is to create division among the West. But he actually did the opposite.” We were joined by a thoughtful and engaged audience which came as no surprise given the nature of the crowd at SXSW.   I appreciated the audience’s willingness to challenge the members on how bipartisanship is possible in the current polarized environment. Rep. Meijer highlighted the progress that they often make when you cut out microphones and cameras and can have real conversations without fear of clips appearing in attack ads. Rep. Jacobs made clear that she is not a moderate when arguing that bipartisanship isn’t finding the watered down compromise, but working across the aisle to make real progress on a shared interest.  Our conversation reinforced that meaningful bipartisanship relies on faithful partisans finding compromise on policy while holding fast to principle.

What’s bringing Democrats and Republicans together? Competitiveness—namely, how competitive U.S. firms and industries are relative to peers in other countries, especially China. In June 2021, the Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) with strong bipartisan support. In early February 2022, the House passed the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act. Unlike the Senate, the House bill passed along mostly party lines, with one Republican vote for, and one Democratic vote against. The two bills, which have many similarities but also stark differences, now heads to some form of conference. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), one of the cosponsors of the original legislation that became USICA, has set a rough deadline of Memorial Day for resolution and final passage. Last month, the Bipartisan Policy Center hosted an insightful discussion of what the bills include, what happens next in terms of legislative process, and, most importantly, how the legislation could strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness. The event, “Moving Forward to Boost U.S. Competitiveness: Next Steps for Congress,” featured a conversation with Sen. Todd Young (R-IN), Schumer’s cosponsor on the original legislation. Sen. Young was followed by a panel discussion with: Maryann Feldman Heninger Distinguished Professor of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina Adjunct professor of finance at Kenan-Flagler Business School Research Director at UNC Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise Chris Griswold Policy Director, American Compass John Neuffer CEO, Semiconductor Industry Association Overflowing with insight, our discussion inevitably could not cover every dimension of competitiveness or the pending bills.

    "content": "As the US looks to reform Section 230, tracking the policies abroad is essential.  European countries and the EU face similar policy questions but with a different legal and governance framework. In this second part of our ongoing series on intermediary liability (IML), we will review the policy and legal frameworks that impact content moderation in Europe. E-Commerce Directive  The European Union’s approach to intermediary liability (IML) as first established in Directive 2000/31/EC, also known as the E-Commerce Directive (ECD). Like Section 230, the ECD provides a liability shield for “passive” online services offering the following:  Mere conduit – the transmission or temporary storage of third-party content. A mere conduit cannot initiate the transmission of information, select the receiver of the transmission, or select or modify the information contained in the transmission.  Caching – the automatic, intermediate, and temporary storage of information for the sole purpose of more efficiently facilitating the information’s transmission to other recipients of the service upon their request.  Hosting – the storage of information provided by the recipient of a service.  Importantly, IML protections provided by the ECD do not extend to online services playing a more active role in content organization, as many social media platforms do. The law also prohibits EU member states from imposing general information monitoring obligations on information society service providers, which are defined as a “service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services.”    While the ECD does not contain an explicit distinction between “active” and “passive” hosts, Articles 13 and 14 each contain an “actual knowledge” provision specific to caching and hosting services; online services acting in these capacities must remove illegal content “as fast as possible” once they are aware of it. The ECD’s more general requirement that information society service providers’ activities be of a “mere technical, automatic, and passive nature” was elaborated on by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Google France and L’Oréal v. eBay cases. The court drew distinctions between active and passive hosts based on Recital 42 of the ECD, clarifying that intermediaries become active hosts and lose liability protections once they take steps to frame how information is presented to users. The CJEU has ruled separately that service providers may open themselves up to liability if they become aware of facts or circumstances which should have given them knowledge of illegal activity on their platforms.   Digital Services Act  In the face of new challenges brought on by the rise of large online platforms, the European Commission (EC) under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen has put forward a proposed Digital Services Act (DSA) to update ECD with new provisions regarding illegal content, transparent advertising, disinformation, and intermediary liability. Fresh off its success with implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, the EU is not only hoping to build on its technology policy frameworks but also to establish global standards and export its&hellip;",

    "content": "To substantially reduce carbon emissions and meet national climate goals over the next decade, the United States must accelerate investment in cleaner and greener infrastructure. To that end, project delivery, particularly the process for assessing environmental impacts and acquiring required permits and approvals, must become more efficient and timelier than it has been in the past.   BPC previously outlined how permitting risk—the risk of project delays in the permitting and environmental review process—has been a significant disincentive to private investment in emissions-reducing public infrastructure. In recent years, finding ways to fast-track federal permitting and environmental reviews, while upholding longstanding environmental protections, has been a key bipartisan objective.   The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act not only provides significant new resources to modernize the nation’s critical infrastructure systems, the following provisions will improve the environmental review and permitting process and help reduce timelines for the delivery of clean infrastructure projects.  Permanently authorizes and enhances the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council: The bill lifts the sunset on FAST-41, which established the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC), bringing together agencies at the start of the permitting and review process to establish timely, coordinated agency plans. FAST-41 also created a Permitting Dashboard, which allows the public to review project schedules, descriptions, and other valuable details. Early evidence from the council suggests that these provisions significantly reduced review and permitting timelines. Importantly, this transparency also allows the public to hold project sponsors and agencies accountable. Consistent with BPC recommendations, IIJA expands the number of projects eligible for the FPISC process, for example, to include tribal infrastructure projects.  Codifies “One Federal Decision:” The Trump administration’s Executive Order 13807 adopted “One Federal Decision,” requiring a single lead agency to bear responsibility for shepherding projects through multiagency reviews and keeping agencies to timetables of two years or less to complete the NEPA reviews of major infrastructure projects. IIJA codifies One Federal Decision while limiting most environmental impact statements for major projects to 200 pages.   Creates the Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center: The IPIC, housed within DOT, is tasked with eliminating barriers to efficient and effective permitting and environmental review, as well as developing metrics to implement project delivery reforms. IPIC will also collaborate with FPISC on permitting reform efforts, help DOT’s Build America Bureau navigate environmental review and permitting issues, and serve as DOT’s liaison to the White House Council on Environmental Quality.  Expedites evaluations for projects within operational rights-of-way: For preventative maintenance, preservation, or highway safety projects in an “operational right-of-way,” federal agencies are required to provide a preliminary review of applications within 45 days of project submission. Agencies failing to meet the deadline are subject to reporting requirements describing why the deadline was missed.   Expands the use of categorical exclusions: Categorical exclusions (CEs) apply to projects that, by their nature, do not have a significant environmental impact and therefore do not require more stringent environmental reviews, namely an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. Previously, DOT adopted CEs for “small” projects that receive less than&hellip;",

    "content": "As the COVID-19 pandemic and recession reminded us, millions of Americans are not prepared to weather a financial emergency. Policymakers have an opportunity now to create ways to better support individuals and their families to maintain financial security and build opportunity, and emergency savings is a readily available solution. Families and individuals often find themselves in need of a lifeline during a time of crisis, but for too many Americans, the answer is credit card debt, high-interest loans, or drawing down their retirement savings. Prior to the pandemic, 40% of Americans reported that they would struggle to afford a $400 unexpected emergency and 1 in 4 households now say they have no emergency savings at all. Moreover, disparities across income and race show that in the face of economic crises, certain demographic groups are hit harder than others. Forty-three percent of households making less than $50,000 a year recently reported having no emergency savings. In addition, for every dollar that white households had in emergency savings, Latinx and Black households had just $0.25 and $0.07 in emergency savings, respectively. To support families and individuals in building long-term resilience and financial security during this pandemic and in the face of future crises, policymakers have a critical opportunity to make emergency savings accounts easily accessible. Principles for Emergency Savings Policy Many viable options exist for policymakers to boost emergency savings. To maximize impact, policy innovations should adhere to five key principles: Allow for automatic enrollment in workplace emergency savings Ensure emergency savings are their own “bucket” of savings Allow for a wide range of options, particularly for low-to-moderate income (LMI) households Design emergency savings to meet household needs Safeguard retirement savings Allow for Automatic Enrollment in Workplace Emergency Savings Many employers have started offering emergency savings accounts to their workers, but participation is hampered by the inability to automatically enroll employees (who can then opt out if they so choose). For example, in a retirement-linked emergency savings program in the UK, while nearly 60% of employees at one employer believed that these savings accounts would benefit them, just over 1% of eligible employees signed up for the plan when not automatically enrolled. When automatic enrollment became a standard feature of 401(k) plans in the US, participation nearly doubled, with 93% of new hires contributing. Automatic enrollment also dramatically increased participation among younger, lower-income, and female employees. Automatic enrollment can help ensure equitable access and participation to emergency savings plans in the workforce. Ensure Emergency Savings Are Their Own “Bucket” of Savings Behavioral scientists have consistently found that to ensure emergency savings are used effectively for short-term, unexpected expenses, they should be held in a separate account, or “bucket,” rather than combined with other kinds of savings. Setting up multiple accounts—such as one for emergency savings and another for retirement savings—provides psychological separation, helping ensure emergency savings are used when needed and long-term savings are preserved. To maximize positive impact, emergency savings policy should support models that allow for this important savings design&hellip;",

    "content": "This is Part 1 of an ongoing series to detail the policy considerations for #Section230 and #ContentModeration. In this post, BPC covers the background of Section 230 in the US. Buried within the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which was itself tucked away in the larger Telecommunications Act of 1996, included a twenty-six-word phrase that would radically influence the development of the Internet: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” This sentence was part of Section 230 of the CDA, the remainder of which clarified exceptions for federal criminal law, intellectual property law, and electronic communications privacy laws. Since its enactment into law in 1996, Section 230 has shaped how the issue of intermediary liability (IML) would be managed in the United States. It has formed the bedrock under which massive online platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube were built on. By expressly shielding online service providers from being held liable for the content users publish on their platforms, Section 230 allowed them to grow exponentially during the first two decades of the 21st century and define the Internet Age. In the years since Section 230’s passage, other jurisdictions adopted or began developing systems of intermediary liability which formed the basis for most online interactions and commerce. While the specific provisions of IML regimes may differ in their approach, they generally address common elements such as: Protection for companies against being considered a speaker or publisher of user information Requirements for companies to remove illegal content when becoming aware or notified Requirements for companies to remove some harmful or objectionable content Protections for companies who undertake measures to remove harmful or objectionable (but not illegal) content Protections against being compelled to undertake monitoring While policymakers in 1996 the US may not have been aware of how consequential Section 230 would end up being, its reverberations throughout societies worldwide have informed how many countries now seek to approach IML protections, ranging from crafting brand new regimes, to enacting comprehensive reforms, and even considering scrapping them entirely. All three approaches, in addition to keeping the status quo, have their own major implications for the future of online content and its moderation, and prevailing business models of major tech companies. IML in the United States Background Although nowadays intermediary liability is so inextricably linked to online content and platforms, the concept far predates the Internet. Before 1996, courts frequently turned to the standard set in the 1959 Supreme Court case Smith v. California, in which the Court overturned the conviction of a Los Angeles bookstore owner who had unwittingly sold a book that contained erotica in violation of a city ordinance. The decision in this case, which was clarified by future rulings, established that distributors are only liable if it can be reasonably established that they should have known about the illegal content.  This legal precedent was largely satisfactory for determining intermediary liability until the&hellip;",

In an email message to the student, the university’s vice president of academic affairs and dean of the faculty asserted that promotion of the recital on the Friends University Fine Arts Facebook page suggested the university gave its imprimatur to the event.  Here&#8217;s What Thousands of Students, Employees at Iowa Public Universities Said About Free Speech   Cleo Krejci | Iowa City Press-Citizen | February 16, 2022  The State of Iowa Board of Regents’ Free Speech Committee released a report on a survey of students and faculty at Iowa’s three public universities. Among the findings: “just 56% of students and 49% of employees agree their university environment ‘allows me to say things I believe.’” The Free Speech Committee, established in 2020, is charged with conducting biennial surveys, hearing complaints, reviewing policies, and implementing free-speech training.  UW Returns $5M to Donor After Disagreement Over Professor’s Views on Israel  Nina Shapiro | The Seattle Times | March 5, 2022   In a case that raises questions about conflicts between commitments to donor intent and to faculty academic freedom, the University of Washington returned a $5 million gift to a donor after the donor was dismayed by comments expressed by the chair of the university’s Israel Studies Program.

This development has opened up opportunities for a potential bipartisan compromise on a major strategy for reducing global emissions. GOP officials are interested in a climate and trade policy that would recapture America’s global market share for strategic industries, return key components of the supply chain to U.S. shores, resurrect domestic manufacturing, block the transfer of U.S. jobs to other economies, and hold accountable the world’s major polluters, particularly China, for their global pollution. In December of last year, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and H.R. McMaster, former national security adviser to President Trump, co-authored an op-ed in Foreign Policy, calling for a common approach on climate and trade policy between the United States and the EU that would curtail Russian energy dominance on the continent. Cramer and McMaster argued that the EU should recognize the climate and energy security benefits of using U.S. energy over Russian supply. Last month, Cramer and McMaster joined the Bipartisan Policy Center to discuss this topic and pathways to bipartisan climate and trade policy.",

    "content": "We can do our part, we can manage things, we just need support for what we’re doing” Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, small businesses experienced difficulties with access to capital, workforce/competitiveness, procurement, and child care. Small businesses are recovering from the pandemic, however the government support businesses received in the form of tax credits, loans, and grants have expired. The Fed’s 2022 Small Business Credit Survey found that revenues remain below pre-pandemic levels for 63% of firms, and 76% of firms decreased employment or paused hiring. The government has already applied billions of dollars towards small business issues, but the persistence of these challenges emphasizes the need for renewed attention and other reforms to support growth and recovery.   The Bipartisan Policy Center’s (BPC) Business project published “From Pandemic to Prosperity: Bipartisan Solutions to Support Today’s Small Businesses”, a report exploring the four principal areas — access to capital, workforce/competitiveness, procurement, and child care — where small businesses face challenges, in collaboration with Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices. Discussions with members of Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices, policy experts, current and former government officials, and members of Congress and their staff shaped the issue areas and suggested policy options outlined in the report.  When it comes to accessing affordable and flexible capital, small businesses have always had a harder time, especially business owners of color. Research done by the Federal Reserve has found that Black-owned businesses considered to be “low credit risks” are less likely than other small businesses to receive all the financing they seek and less likely to be approved for financing. Small businesses need access to affordable and flexible external credit options to grow. External sources of funding are primarily banks, who expect documentation and paperwork that small businesses often do not have or do not have the bandwidth to provide. Presently, lessons learned from pandemic programs can be used to improve access to capital for all small business owners. Programs such as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) provided an opportunity for expanded credit options as well as the use of online lenders. A BPC report from June 2021 noted that, “It seems clear from the data that some types of online and alternative lenders help fill a gap for those small businesses that don’t have a preexisting relationship with a bank, don’t have high credit scores, or don’t have as much collateral as others.” For small business owners of color, online lenders are important in closing the gaps in accessing affordable and flexible credit options, with more straightforward application processes and by potentially reducing bias.   In 2022, 72% of respondents to Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices national survey who expect to take out a loan or line of credit will do so to grow their business. Application rates for traditional financing, approval rates for financing, and the likelihood of receiving funding desired are all on the decline according to the Small Business Credit Survey.

    "content": "Two years in, the ongoing shocks of the pandemic continue to highlight the fragility of many vital supply chains. A global semiconductor shortage impacting a wide swath of industries is expected to drag on through 2022. Now, with Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting sanctions placed on the country, global energy supply chains are experiencing a stress test like never before. While European reliance on Russian natural gas is making headlines, Russia is also a leading producer of various critical minerals, accounting for 11% of global nickel production and 4% of global cobalt production. Removing Russia as a source could hobble the manufacturing of clean energy technologies like wind turbines and batteries, making it more apparent than ever that a clean energy transition will require durable supply chains insulated from geopolitical instability.  For decades, supply chains for clean energy products, including mineral extraction, processing, and subcomponent manufacturing and assembly have increasingly spread across the globe with dozens, if not hundreds, of stops. From the perspective of driving down costs, this has been extremely helpful. Countries with the expertise and infrastructure to produce individual components or raw materials do so efficiently, making the production of end-use technologies a collaborative, international process. However, a geographically diverse and often obfuscated web of connections is risky when national security and public health emergencies arise.  For example, the map below shows that the electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain spans six continents, creating numerous points where production can fail. While this approach helps customers benefit from lower costs through more efficient production, supply chains are at greater risk of price shocks and product shortages if there’s an issue with a link in the chain. Creating domestic backstops for clean energy supply chains can help insulate the United States from energy instability while also providing global trade networks with another reliable source.   Credit: Bloomberg It is critical to minimize the risk to our nation’s clean energy supply chain. Congress agrees, and that’s why the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provided the DOE Loan Program Office (LPO) with new authorities to invest in projects that increase the domestic supply of critical minerals and to expand programs that invest in manufacturing zero-carbon technologies for vehicles. This includes over $17 billion in direct loans through the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) to support production of materials critical to the EV supply chain, such as batteries and charging infrastructure components, and over $3 billion in loan guarantees in the Title 17 Renewable Energy and Efficient Energy Projects program to support projects such as mining, extraction, processing, recovery, and recycling of critical materials. Using proven federal financing policies, this injection of capital could put the U.S. on the path to building durable domestic clean energy supply chains for a range of technologies.  By providing debt financing for the commercial deployment of clean energy supply chain projects that struggle to find private investment, LPO can help stand up firms that are crucial for producing decarbonized solutions.

    "content": "The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is rapidly approaching its one-year anniversary as the broad range of initiatives funded by it continue to unfold. One of the most visible programs within the Rescue Plan is the unprecedented $350 billion State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF) which is intended to support jurisdictions with their response to and recovery from the COVID-19 health emergency. This direct, flexible aid has given state and local leaders myriad options to address the health and economic impacts of COVID-19—with planned uses including housing, community aid, infrastructure, public health, government operations, economic development, and public safety.   Efforts to track planned and budgeted projects using SLFRF allocations show that recipients have significant dollars uncommitted—providing a window of opportunity to further direct these flexible resources toward highest and best uses.  While some jurisdictions moved quickly to deploy their SLFRF funds, many others have opted for a “go slow” approach. The reasons for such cautious rollouts vary, but many jurisdictions cite uncertainty about SLFRF policy and requirements as a significant brake on implementation.   About two months after ARPA’s enactment, the Treasury Department issued an interim final rule to guide SLFRF recipients—along with an extensive set of FAQs. Despite Treasury’s repeated urgings for recipients to move forward quickly to use SLFRF allocations, many held back in anticipation of more concrete guidance. SLFRF recipients have until December 31, 2024, to incur obligations with their awards and until December 31, 2026, to liquidate those obligations.  Treasury’s SLFRF final rule, issued on January 6, 2022, provides recipients with the assurance necessary to more aggressively put these funds to work in communities. Importantly, the final rule provided recipients with additional flexibility by:  Establishing a standard $10 million allowance for lost public sector revenue  Explicitly permitting SLFRF funds’ use as the non-federal match for other federal programs (excluding Medicaid and CHIP) under the revenue loss provision  Expanding ability to respond to public health and negative economic impacts by broadening the types of households that can be assisted  Broadening capital expenditure opportunities that support eligible COVID-19 public health or economic responses The final rule will take effect on April 1, 2022, but recipients can take significant steps now to position themselves for the next stage of SLFRF implementation. Treasury has prepared an Overview of the Final Rule which is useful in understanding the department’s goals for the SLFRF.   Moving forward, a remaining challenge for SLFRF recipients will be how to leverage these funds in conjunction with the vast amount of other federal financial assistance that has flowed to the state and local level over the past two years. The funding streams emanating from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, ARPA, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) have created a federal funding puzzle for public officials. Local jurisdictions are faced with attempting to identify the best funding source for any need, determining how to access those funds, and ultimately addressing recovery needs that provide the greatest&hellip;",

    "content": "Since the onset of the pandemic, there has been an unprecedented influx of federal funding into the early childhood space, including the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) passed in March 2021. The ARP allocated $39 billion dollars in relief funding for the child care sector; $24 billion of which were dedicated to a one-time stabilization grant program to address the fragility of the child care industry and help providers remain financially viable. This blog summarizes how states have spent or committed these stabilization funds.   Nearly a year has passed since the American Rescue Plan Act allocated $24 billion to stabilize child care and help providers respond to the ongoing challenges from the pandemic.   Per ARP, the majority of funding each state receives must be distributed as subgrants to eligible child care providers. Providers must apply for funding through their state’s application. Funding can be used for personnel costs, rent and facility maintenance, personal protective equipment, equipment to deal with the public health emergency, goods and services needed to resume child care, and mental health supports for children and employees. As of early February 2022, three states have yet to release applications for providers to request funding: Texas, Missouri, and Florida.  The Bipartisan Policy Center has tracked how all the remaining states and the District of Columbia have chosen to allocate and spend their ARP stabilization funding. We found that state progress on distributing these funds varies widely. As of December 2021, 16 states have not obligated 50% of their stabilization subgrants, with nine states having obligated no funding, as reported by the Department of Health and Human Services. It is important to note that some states are releasing the funds to child care providers, but their reports are not yet reported to HHS pending state government review procedures.   While some states are behind, 21 states have released updates about how these funds have been liquidated. Of those with updates, 17 states reveal the number of providers who have received funds, and 15 states report the amount of funding disbursed. As per the most recent, publicly available data, the 21 states that have released updates have awarded $3,176,282,850 to providers, with over 60,160 qualifying child care providers receiving support.   Some states are obligating extra money to providers who use stabilization funds to support their workforce. In New Jersey, more than 2,000 child care workers have received bonuses of $1,000. Michigan has given $1,000 bonuses to 24,947 full-time child care workers, and bonuses of $500 to 13,213 part-time child care workers. To increase the transparency of the ARP stabilization funding progress, Indiana, Nebraska, New York, and Wisconsin have publicly available data dashboards to follow spending updates in real-time.   Of note, some states have struggled to obligate funds due to the need for state legislative approval for funds. State legislative approval places an additional administrative burden upon states when attempting to spend their federal dollars. In total, 29 states have restrictions on or were unable to spend ARP funds without state legislative action.  &hellip;",

Americans also perceive partisan divides to be growing during the Biden administration. More than half of voters (52%) think partisan polarization has increased and they cite the role of money in politics, spread of misinformation, media, and social media as the top causes of polarization. In the past two years, about a third of voters have avoided conversations with people who have different political views, limited their time watching cable news, and limited time on social media. However, the poll also found an appetite for Republicans and Democrats to work together to pass bipartisan legislation. A bipartisan majority of voters want to see Democrats and Republicans work together on health care, criminal justice, and working families legislation, rather than Democrats or Republicans solely working on the issue. Methodology This poll was conducted between February 18-20, 2022 among a sample of 2,005 registered voters. The interviews were conducted online and the data were weighted to approximate a target sample of registered voters based on gender by age, educational attainment, race, marital status, home ownership, race by educational attainment, 2020 presidential vote, and region.

    "content": "In March 2021, we wrote about a significant gap in labor force participation between women and men of prime parenting age, finding that since the summer of 2020, parent-age women had been “substantially more likely than parent-age men to remain out of the labor force.” After nearly 18 months, that gap has not closed, with ramifications for women’s financial security. Though the COVID-19 pandemic triggered this disparity, numerous factors made mothers particularly vulnerable to such a shock. Female labor force participation will continue to lag without adoption of policies that help lower barriers to work for parent-age women. After a tumultuous 2020, the labor market started to find its footing in 2021. January 2022 marked the 13th straight month of employment growth as payrolls neared pre-pandemic levels, and the unemployment rate fell below 4% in December 2021 for the first time since February 2020. Even the labor force participation rate—stuck between 61.4% and 61.7% since June 2020—finally broke out of that range in November 2021 and is 62.2% as of January 2022. As shown in Chart 1, the male and female labor force participation rates have followed similar paths since the beginning of the pandemic: a sharp decline as the economy shed more than 20 million jobs followed by a rapid partial recovery before 18 months of extremely slow progress.1 Women’s labor force recovery lagged men’s for much of the second half of 2020 and into 2021, but women made up significantly more ground last year, as the female labor force participation rate increased 0.8 percentage points compared to men’s 0.2 percentage point gain. Still, the male and female labor force participation rates both sit more than a percentage point off their pre-pandemic level—a deficit of more than three million people neither working nor looking for work. Further, for parent-age women, Chart 1 does not tell the full story. Analysis throughout the pandemic has shed light on the disproportionate challenges working mothers face. The overall labor force participation figures, covering everyone older than 16, obscure this reality. Chart 2, in contrast, focuses on those between the ages of 20 and 44 (the group most likely to have children under the age of 12). Examining this population reveals a sizeable gender gap that persisted for most of the pandemic—as well as a trend highlighting the significant structural issues at play. The labor force disruption of COVID-19 initially had a similar impact on both parent-age men and women, as lockdown measures and public health considerations caused businesses to close and kept workers at home. But labor force participation of parent-age women began to lag that of parent-age men around the beginning of the school year in fall 2020, potentially reflecting unequal caregiving responsibilities in the face of significant interruptions to education and childcare. The resulting gap of roughly a percentage point persisted through that school year but shrank during the summer of 2021—only to grow again to its largest of the pandemic at the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year.

    "content": "Access to child care is critical for parents to rejoin the workforce, yet deciding on a child care arrangement is a difficult decision that has become even harder due to the pandemic. A parent’s decision to use a formal (a child care center, family child care home or preschool) or informal (parent provided care or relative care) child care arrangement depends on a variety of factors such as accessibility, affordability, and trust. For American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) parents, a legacy of injustices, lack of trust, and the desire for intentional learning of cultures also affects these choices. There are 574 federally recognized tribal nations and Alaska Native villages and 326 federal Indian reservations. As of 2019, there were approximately 5.7 million people in the U.S. who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), or about two percent of the U.S. population. According to 2020 U.S. Census Bureau data, there are an estimated 179,000 AI/AN children under five years old. Nearly half live in single-parent households and about a third (30%) of them live below the federal poverty line, compared to 13% of children under five nationally. Although federal programs do exist to serve AI/AN children and families, limited funding means these programs only serve a fraction of AI/AN children and families. In December 2021, the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult conducted a national survey of AI/AN parents with children under 12 to understand their current use of and demand for child care. In particular, BPC wanted to gauge what AI/AN parents consider when making child care decisions, access to care in their community, and the impact on their ability to work. Below are key takeaways from the survey. Three in four (77%) AI/AN parents who have someone in their household not working say child care responsibilities influenced their decision to not work, including 64% who said this significantly influenced their decision. Over half of surveyed parents (53%) say child care responsibilities have impacted their ability to work over the past month, of whom half (49%) have missed over eight hours and a third (31%) have missed over 17 hours of work due to child care responsibilities. &#8216; The pandemic destabilized work for many people, especially child care businesses. Half of the surveyed AI/AN parents currently using a formal child care arrangement (55%) said their provider is experiencing employee shortages. A fifth of AI/AN parents (18%) said the child care arrangement they used prior to the pandemic is closed, compared to 10% of parents nationally.

    "content": "The U.S. Senate is generally understood to be a deliberate and slow-moving institution. Senators have increasingly expressed displeasure, however, with the amount of time votes are consuming on the floor. In March 2021, the Senate broke the record for longest vote ever at more than 11 hours, and in January, the Senate held open a lengthy four-hour vote. Tensions boiled over for some senators in early February, and shortly thereafter a bipartisan group of nearly 70 senators (35 Republican, 33 Democrat) endorsed procedural changes to reduce how long votes take. These senators may be right to complain, because our analysis shows that the Senate is spending considerably more time on floor votes than in recent years. While some business in the Senate is conducted relatively quickly via unanimous consent, roll call votes themselves take more time and can require every member to come to the floor. Voting often entails a long, tedious process where the floor clerks read out the names of each individual Senator, many of whom are not in the chamber all at once, and then records each vote as it is cast. This process is known as roll call voting. In recent years, the average time per vote in the Senate has increased dramatically. Using data obtained from C-SPAN, we see that the average time spent per roll call vote increased by over 50% when comparing the 113th Congress (2013-2014) to the current 117th Congress. Overall, the Senate is spending much more time on votes than usual. During the 113th-115th Congresses, the Senate spent between 11-13% of its total floor time on votes. The rest was spent in debate or waiting for other activities to occur. That nearly doubled during the 116th Congress to 20%. Notably, because this data compares only the first 410 days of each Congress, the Senate was not yet experiencing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the institution to adopt even slower voting methods for much of 2020. Source: C-SPAN The amount of time spent on votes jumped again during the 117th Congress. Since 2020, the Senate has spent 30.8% of all its time voting on legislation, an increase of 50% over the 116th and almost three times as much as the 113th. And while pandemic safety precautions may seem like a reasonable explanation, any casual observer of the Senate floor over the last year can see that its stringent voting processes are no longer in place. Understandably, senators are feeling frustrated. Often, just one or two senators slow the vote down for the rest of their colleagues, keeping them from moving on to other business. This is less of a problem for the House of Representatives. The House, which uses an electronic voting system adopted in the 1970s, can quickly tabulate the votes of all 435 members far quicker than the Senate. Members come to the floor, insert an identification card into a voting device, and cast their vote. The House has had its own instances where votes were held&hellip;",

    "content": "Headlines about how worker shortages are impacting businesses across the nation—from your favorite drive-thru to retail stores to manufacturing plants and running out of substitute teachers—are constant. COVID-19 continues to disrupt life throughout the U.S. The shortage within health services, however, is possibly most pervasive across the entire job landscape, dominating headlines and forcing states, as well as Congress, to take notice. A sampling of headlines from earlier this month: Boston Herald (2/5): Nurses struggle with staffing shortages, low pay as colleagues leave in droves Axios (2/8): Fixing the health-care worker shortage Becker’s Hospital Review (2/11): Hospitals plead with Congress to tackle workforce shortages WXAX3 – CBS (Vermont)(2/14): Home health care worker shortage leaves families in a bind U.S. Army (2/15): Utah National Guard supports hospitals facing COVID surge If you saw the jobs report released earlier this month, the employment situation is starting to look more positive: The unemployment rate is at 4%, down from a peak of 14.7% in April of 2020, and non-farm payrolls jumped by 467,000 in January. Through the months of COVID-19, however, health care and social services saw one of the largest drops in employment. According to the January release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in health care trended up for the month but is “down by 378,000, or 2.3 percent, from its level in February 2020.” With emergency department visits rising prior to the pandemic—up more than 60% since 1997—and hospitals still crowded with COVID-19 patients, what does this say about the future of health care in the U.S.? According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. is facing a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, both in primary and specialty care. Nursing is facing its own challenges: Reports project that over 1 million new registered nurses will be needed by 2030. Between December 2020 and December 2021, health care added 63,300 jobs—a 0.4% increase. While some might look at that number and say, “But it went up!” the answer isn’t as promising as you might think: As Modern Healthcare’s piece points out, that number pales in comparison to the year before the pandemic when there was a 2.1% increase. While the health care workforce issues have gained national attention thanks to COVID-19, the shortage has been in the making for a while. In a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) workshop on the oncology workforce in 2009, concerns about a shortage of physicians, nurses, and health care professionals were evident even then. From NAS: “Many health specialties, including oncology, currently report a shortage of physicians. Despite an expected 21% increase in medical school enrollments between 2002 and 2012, the number of residencies has only increased 8% over the past five years.” The summary continues, “According to a 2005 survey of surgical residents, over 50% planned on pursuing subspecialty training, and only 15% planned on entering the workforce as a general surgeon.” So why is there a shortage? Much of the answer is the aging U.S. population. Baby&hellip;",

    "content": "The pace and scale of the energy transition will need to increase significantly to meet net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Fossil fuels currently drive more than 80% of global primary energy despite rapid growth in low-carbon technologies such as wind and solar in recent decades. It is clear today that the energy system is facing an enormous transformation as climate policy forces gain momentum here in the US and globally. Renewable energy is mainstream, advanced technologies are emerging from the labs and entering the marketplace, energy customers want cleaner options, and governments including ours are starting to get real with a policy agenda. At the center of it all is the oil and gas industry, the workhorse of our current energy economy. The “divestment vs investment” discussion is becoming increasingly relevant as we grapple with energy supply issues in real time. Is divestment from oil and gas the fastest route toward success or is the most sensible path an accelerated program of public and private investment in advanced technology development with the oil and gas industry? In the public imagination, the answer to this question falls into two broad categories: (1) these industries will need to phase out, or (2) today’s energy industry must be an active player in delivering clean energy at scale. On February 9, BPC’s Executive Director of the Energy Program, Sasha Mackler, talked with a diverse group of energy policy experts on this topic: Kevin Book, Managing Director of ClearView Energy Partners LLC, Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President of Strategy and Sustainability at Chevron, Sarah Ladislaw, Managing Director of the US Program at RMI, and John Larsen, Partner at the Rhodium Group. Kevin Book started the event off with a challenge: Sarah Ladislaw shared her concern for the divestment vs investment tension in the policy world now by wishing for a DeLorean flux capacitor to whisk her and anyone looking for a stable transition back in time. The panelists summed up our conversation by all agreeing, with many a cautionary note, that oil and gas sector expertise can play a strong role in the energy transition with BPC’s Executive Director of the Energy Program, Sasha Mackler, offering his perspective: “…We see the worlds largest logistics companies and well-capitalized energy companies needing to be at the table and really driving us in an accelerated way.” Kevin Book reminded the audience that the energy transition is likely going to cost more than the government is willing to spend. Sarah Ladislaw noted that the players today may be very different tomorrow. Bruce Niemeyer reminded the audience that the oil/gas sector has the skills and business imperative to continue to decarbonize. Chevron supports the goals of the Paris Accords. John Larsen capped off our conversation with a cautionary note.",

    "content": "The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) recently released its America’s Rental Housing 2022 report, finding a rental market characterized by a number of “record-breaking conditions.” The report provides a comprehensive overview of the U.S. rental market along with an analysis of several emerging trends. The Situation In 2019, more than a third of all U.S. households, some 44 million people, rented their homes, representing a 13.9% “surge in renter household growth” from 2009. Householders aged 25-34 continued to account for the lion’s share of all renters—representing 26% of all renter households in 2019. In addition to strong Millennial rentership rates, there has been a notable increase in the number of middle- and older-aged renters: between 2009 and 2019, renter households aged 55-64 and 65-74 grew by a rate of 40.6% and 67.1%, respectively. Demographically, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented among the nation’s renter population. Though still representing the largest number of renters, white households rented at a rate of just 28% in 2019 compared with Black, Hispanic, and Asian rentership rates of 58%, 52%, and 39%, respectively. In 2019, 20.4 million American renter households were cost-burdened, spending more than of 30% of their income on housing costs. Of this number, 10.5 million were severely rent-burdened, spending at least half their incomes on housing. Of particular concern is the rising share of middle-income households struggling to afford their monthly rents. Between 2014 and 2019, the number of cost-burdened households earning between $30,000 – $75,000 rose by 4% to a total of 41%. Just as the high incidence of cost burdens “among lower-income renters is due in large measure to the shortage of low-cost housing,” a lack of affordable and available homes for a growing number of middle-income earners makes finding affordable housing increasingly difficult. In addition to rising rents, home prices have risen too, locking out many Americans from homeownership and the opportunity to build wealth that comes with it. Harvard’s JCHS previously found that “nearly all of the net growth in homeowners from 2010 to 2018 was among households with incomes of $150,000 or more.” With historically high home prices alongside historically low housing inventories, more Americans have looked to the rental market for shelter, pushing up rentership rates even among older and higher-income households. Shifting Trends Demand A large share of the growth in America’s rental market has catered to higher-income households. With the number of older, high-income renter households at a record high, investors have seen lucrative returns on large, high-quality buildings with little incentive to build for lower-income households. Between 2009-2019, the number of renter households with an income of $75,000 and above rose by 48.4% as the number of renter households earning $15,000 &#8211; $29,999 (an income level that dominated the rental market share in 2009) fell by 4.6%. Where high-income renters represented a minority of renters in 2009, they represented the majority of all renters in 2019. Supply To satiate the demand for high-quality rental housing, there has been a boom&hellip;",

We are in the middle of another such period. Warning signs about U.S. competitiveness, compounded by economic pressures from China, raise the stakes for policymakers in taking action. Lawmakers are hungry for better knowledge and understanding of everything that falls under the banner of “competitiveness.” From semiconductor subsidies to export controls, the defense industrial base to workforce development, the very notion of competitiveness policy is almost too broad to draw boundaries around. That makes it nearly impossible for any individual member of Congress or their staff to stay fully informed about every dimension of competitiveness. Robust research exists on topics related to competitiveness, such as industrial policy and technology commercialization, and states and regions across the U.S. have experience developing successful innovation policy. Yet there are few good mechanisms or processes for summarizing those lessons and translating them in a useful way for decision makers. To fill this gap, we are kicking off a series of research summaries that will give public and private leaders relevant information and understanding to guide future action. There has been a proliferation of academic literature on our nation’s competitiveness strategy, the “long game” being played by China, and whether U.S. leaders “got China wrong.” Researchers have also called attention to economic indicators that point to a steady decline in domestic dynamism. The topics we cover will span a range of issue areas, including the competitiveness implications of growing federal debt, different types of industrial policy, and lessons learned from past place-based policy. &nbsp;",

    "content": "Since the beginning of his term, President Biden has made it clear that the United States must increase its global competitiveness. In his first joint address to Congress, in April 2021, he called for the United States to increase its investment in technology, arguing that China and other nations could overtake the country in terms of ambition and innovation. He noted that America invests less of its GDP in research and development than it did decades ago, and asserted that the U.S. must be active in developing the “technologies of the future.” Congress also has been engaged in legislation aimed at increasing the country’s competitiveness, especially in technology, given the emergence of China in these fields. The Endless Frontier Act, introduced in April 2021, aimed to address some of the concerns that Biden enumerated in his first joint address to Congress. It would add a technology directorate to the National Science Foundation, directly appropriate $52 billion for a domestic semiconductor manufacturing initiative, and establish new controls on foreign involvement in the U.S. research system. Key points of the act were incorporated into the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which passed the Senate on June 8, 2021. On January 21, 2022, the Biden administration announced agency actions by the Departments of State and Homeland Security to increase access to international STEM talent, calling the fields “critical to the prosperity, security, and health of our Nation,” and recognizing that attracting global talent is key to maintaining the United States’ global competitive advantage. The actions build on Executive Order 14012, which aimed to remove barriers to legal immigration and restore trust in the system and efforts to promote educational exchanges. On February 2, 2022, the House passed the America COMPETES Act, H.R. 4521, its response to USICA, which, in addition to other provisions, includes specific immigration changes to allow foreign students in STEM fields easier access to work and green cards, as well as a new visa for entrepreneurs in start-up companies. These changes seem to be part of an emerging doctrine for this administration on global competitiveness, a “Biden Doctrine” on cementing America’s position in the world as a leader in technology, research and innovation. These new agency actions on international STEM talent, along with the immigration provisions contained in the America COMPETES Act, recognize that immigration can be a key part of maintaining America’s global competitive edge. We are encouraged to see that one of the announced administrative actions targets National Interest Waivers (NIWs), an area that we pointed out in October 2021 needed reexamination and restructuring. Though we advocated for congressional action, this clarification is the first step in making the system more transparent and easily navigable. In essence, USCIS has updated its policy manual to provide more guidance for the adjudication of NIWs, a provision in law that allows the government to waive the statutory requirement of a sponsoring employer for a green card, and the labor certification that there are no U.S. workers qualified and available for&hellip;",

    "content": "The rise of platforms and digitization has raised questions about current antitrust laws and the adequacy of current competition policy. The previous blogs (see parts 1, part 2, and part 3) looked at the platform business model, the effects of digitization, and competition. This final blog in the series will look at the regulation of digital platforms from a competition perspective. The blog will examine the debate around competition policy and the policy options currently being discussed. The government plays an important role in promoting competitive markets through regulation and antitrust enforcement. Policymakers face challenges finding the right tools to promote competition and must strike the right balance between over and under-enforcement. The rise of digital platforms has provided an opportunity to reevaluate existing antitrust and competition policies to help determine whether or how policymakers should update them. Government entities around the world have been scrutinizing large digital platforms from a competition perspective. The United Kingdom created an expert panel to study digital competition, and the panel issued a report in 2019. Similarly, the European Commission requested three experts to write a report on competition in the digital era, and these experts also published their report in 2019. In 2020, the House Judiciary Committee’s Democrats and Republicans issued separate reports on digital market competition. These reports have been the source of major debate with critics and supporters. Policymakers on Capitol Hill and the antitrust enforcement agencies are currently considering several options for modifying competition policy in the digital era. There are several broad questions to be considered before looking at a particular policy: are there specific qualities of digital platforms that existing policy is not well suited for? What problem or problems are policymakers trying to address with digital platforms, and are competition policy and antitrust appropriate tools for addressing them? What potential tradeoffs or unintended consequences could arise? An evidence-based approach to competition policy is critical and requires gathering data. Last year, the FTC released data they collected about certain acquisitions made by some of the largest digital platforms. Policymakers should encourage activities like these and further identify any data gaps and ways to best fill them. Policymakers should decide whether they want antitrust laws and competition policy to differentiate between digital platforms (or whatever term they use) and other firms. If they decide to differentiate, they should define the term and decide whether to differentiate between digital platforms based on criteria such as size. Several bills in the House create a new “covered platforms” designation that targets the largest digital platforms. Policymakers are also considering whether to mandate data portability and interoperability standards and how to potentially design them. Data portability and interoperability are tools used for transferring data for moving data across platforms easily and regularly. Supporters argue mandating these tools can boost competition by lowering switching costs to consumers and making data more accessible to non-incumbent firms. Critics, however, disagree and highlight technical challenges to implementation and privacy and security concerns. The Access Act is a&hellip;",

With more than $6 billion allocated for forest restoration, hazardous fuels management, and wood products innovation, and other natural climate solutions, the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in November 2021 underscores the significant bipartisan support for investing in the nation’s natural infrastructure. Building on this momentum, and in advance of the upcoming Farm Bill negotiations, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Farm and Forest Carbon Solutions Task Force released its consensus report on Federal Policies to Advance Natural Climate Solutions. BPC welcomed Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on February 2, 2022 for a discussion on the task force’s policy recommendations found in the report. This virtual, public event featured the Secretary’s remarks on the efforts to scale public and private investments in climate-smart agriculture and forestry, as well as a fireside chat with the Task Force’s Co-Chairs, former Senators Heidi Heitkamp and Saxby Chambliss. As highlighted by Secretary Vilsack, there is tremendous opportunity identified in the task force report, and in alignment with USDA goals, to leverage American farms, rangelands, and forests in the national effort to mitigate the consequences of a changing climate. At the same time, there is the potential to bring more revenue and income opportunities to producers, ranchers, and forest landowners through climate-smart practices. In short, he noted, “there’s an opportunity here not only to impact the climate, but to improve farm income.”",

    "content": "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) directs the U.S. Department of Transportation to establish a national per-mile road usage fee pilot program while continuing to support state-level pilots. Mileage-based user fees, also known as Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) fees, charge drivers a fee based on the number of miles driven as opposed to taxing motor fuel, the primary revenue source for federal and most states’ transportation infrastructure spending. IIJA-authorized pilot programs will replace the existing Surface Transportation System Funding Alternatives Program, which was established in 2015 to provide grants to states to explore alternatives to motor fuel taxes. The federal government and many state governments rely on excise fees on motor fuel to maintain safe, efficient modes of transportation. However, as vehicles become more fuel efficient, gas taxes will not be a long-term sustainable means to fund roads, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure. The Biden administration has set the ambitious goal of a 50% electric vehicle sales share by 2030—a critical step in helping the administration meet its overall goal of net-zero U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Several major U.S. auto manufacturers have signaled their intention to help meet that target. Even without these efforts to boost EV uptake, the number of EVs sold in the U.S. is expected to more than double between 2021 and 2024, with EVs representing a growing share of cars on the road. 45 states and DC provide some sort of incentive for EVs; 13 states and DC require manufacturers to sell a certain number of vehicles that do not emit tailpipe emissions per year. Many of these states rely on state-level gas taxes to fund transportation infrastructure, in addition to federal support. As EV ownership rises, transportation infrastructure will require an alternative source of dedicated revenue at both the state and federal levels. Federal surface transportation legislation from 2015 established the STSFA program, which has provided $95 million in grants to individual states and coalitions of states, with a minimum 50% matching requirement for grantees. The STSFA program was intended to inform Congress about whether mileage-based user fees could serve as a viable replacement for the gas tax. In addition to designing and implementing the pilot programs, grantees were required to conduct outreach raising public awareness about the need for alternative highway funding sources and to provide recommendations for a future user-based road fee program. As seen in the three maps below, STSFA funded pilots in 13 individual states as well as two coalitions of states: the Western Road Usage Charge Consortium (RUC West) and the Eastern Transportation Coalition, which both aim to test the feasibility of regional mileage-based user fee systems. All STSFA pilots were limited to volunteer participants, ranging from 100 to 5,000. Six states have ongoing pilot programs funded by STSFA. Oregon and Utah have the most advanced pilot projects, where drivers can avoid paying registration fees by opting instead to pay mileage-based user fees, with revenue directed to transportation infrastructure projects.

    "content": "The unique challenges facing working women remain central to America’s ongoing labor supply problems that undermine economic growth and contribute to inflation. While much of the focus has rightly been placed on the role of caregiving, child care and school closures, and the lack of adequate paid leave, it is also important to consider how bolstering workplace protections would help women build their careers at the onset of growing a family. No federal law guarantees pregnant workers the right to reasonable accommodations or protections from discrimination in the workplace. To better understand the role of pregnancy discrimination today, the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult conducted a survey on the prevalence of pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. The survey finds that pregnancy discrimination is common across race, incomes, and other demographics, causing fear about informing employers about a pregnancy and leading many pregnant workers to consider a career change. These trends are particularly elevated among younger women and those who are currently working. Nearly 1 in 4 (23%) mothers have considered leaving their jobs due to a lack of reasonable accommodations or fear of discrimination during a pregnancy. 1 in 5 mothers (20%) say they have experienced pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. Morning Consult surveyed a national sample of 2,200 adults. The survey was conducted February 4-February 6, 2022.",

    "content": "When parents’ options of child care arrangements are limited and they are unable to access care, it impacts their ability to participate in the workforce – either opting out entirely or limiting the hours they work. Because of the general nature and characteristics of rural communities, the options for child care in those communities are felt more acutely. In August 2021, BPC and Morning Consult surveyed parents in rural America to determine their needs and access to child care. We’ve also analyzed the child care gap in 35 states and the economic impact of the gap to better understand how child care access and the workforce are connected in rural America. The average gap between the potential need for care and the current supply is 31.7% across 35 states. This gap is even wider in rural communities, with the average percent gap in supply being 35.1%. Though this data is focused on potential need for child care, not the direct demand, it is consistent with other BPC survey responses. When asked about their current arrangements, 45% of rural parents surveyed said that either they or their spouse provide care for their child. But 25% of rural parents said that themselves or their spouse providing child care is their preferred option. This shift between current and preferred arrangements demonstrates an interest in other child care arrangements. Specifically, child care centers, part-day Pre-K programs, and Head Start programs are preferred options by an additional 3%, 9%, and 8% respectively, compared to the parents’ current arrangements for child care. Of the rural parents who are not working, 86% cite child care responsibilities as influencing that decision. A 2019 BPC nationwide survey found that 66% of parents said that child care affects the number of hours they can work. These are parents who could return to the workforce if the child care supply was there. Parents missing from the workforce will impact the economy and could cost the economy between $32.79 and $49.93 billion dollars over the next 10 years through direct losses of household and business taxes, loss of productivity and household income, and does not include any related indirect economic impacts. Determining the cost of the child care gap is long overdue. Cost estimation models may show that child care in smaller communities are more expensive, not less. But if our economy is going to recover fully we are going to need to make sure rural parents are represented in the workforce. For more information on child care in rural communities, watch last year’s event, “Child Care in Rural America – What Have We Learned.”",

    "content": "Congress has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost American competitiveness and prosperity. The U.S. R&amp;D enterprise created the world&#8217;s first flu vaccine, invented the personal computer, and was the first to land a man on the moon. The U.S. has no shortage of incredible technological achievements in its short history. But more importantly, all these achievements trace their roots back to funding from the federal government. Congress is currently considering proposals to build on this legacy by revitalizing federal programs to advance U.S. competitiveness. The Senate passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) (68 – 32) in June 2021 and the House passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022 (America COMPETES) in February 2022. A competitiveness package could have monumental impacts on addressing climate change by establishing and revitalizing critical programs in commercialization, manufacturing, and supply chain security that together provide a comprehensive strategy for advancing necessary clean energy technologies. As Congress works to reconcile the House and Senate bills, BPC recommends the following bipartisan provisions be included in the final bill: Regional Clean Energy Innovation Program (Sec. 10642 of America COMPETES) Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation (Sec. 2528 of USICA and Sec. 10751 of America COMPETES)) Energizing Technology Transfer (Title VI, Subtitle C of America COMPETES) Robust authorization for DOE activities to advance key technology focus areas (Sec. 2117 of USICA and Sec. Division B, Title I of America COMPETES) Clean energy investments can create economic opportunities for Americans, in addition to significant climate benefits. However, these opportunities will only be realized if energy and climate programs are designed at the onset with the intention of benefitting the American people. Currently, innovation is concentrated in just a few key cities – a 2019 report co-authored by Brookings and ITIF finds that from 2005 to 2017, just five metro areas accounted for more than 90% of the nation’s innovation sector growth. As we consider how to improve the nation’s competitiveness, Congress should ensure that Americans across the country benefit from the wealth creation, economic development, and employment opportunities that such investments are certain to bring. In the final legislation, Congress should include the Regional Clean Energy Innovation Program (Sec. 10642 of America COMPETES), a bipartisan provision that would authorize DOE to invest in regions across the country to promote innovation clusters dedicated to making the important advances needed in clean energy. Nonprofit energy foundation In recent years, private companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Unilever, have dedicated billions of dollars to climate and clean energy funds to accelerate solutions meant to address climate change. However, these impressive financial commitments will fall short of their potential unless the public and private sectors work alongside each other to make investments in the most promising clean energy solutions. To maximize these synergies, Congress should include the Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation (Sec. 2528 of USICA and Sec. 10751 of America COMPETES) in the final legislation, which would mobilize public and private sector financing to help bring clean energy technologies to market&hellip;",

    "content": "Prior to 2020, mask mandates, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders were unfamiliar terms to most, but since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, society has come to learn and adapt to the so-called ‘new normal.’ While in many ways the ‘new normal’ is one of remote work and vaccine mandates, it is also one of seemingly pervasive staff shortages, order delays, and general supply chain disruptions. The economy is now experiencing a situation in which millions of jobs are going unfilled, due in part to what is being called the “Great Resignation,” but one overlooked factor in this situation is immigration. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that there were approximately 10.6 million job vacancies in the United States at the end of November 2021, a dramatic increase from the 6.8 million job vacancies in November 2020 and the 6 million job vacancies in December 2019.￼ As the number of job vacancies climbs, filling those vacancies has become increasingly challenging for employers. Compared to the average rate over the past 20 years, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce now estimates that there are only half as many available workers for each open job, and the labor force participation rate remains 1.5 percentage points lower than in February 2020, equivalent to a labor force reduced by more than 2.2 million individuals. Many of these job openings are in occupations essential for the supply chain of goods on store shelves and online orders. For example, the American Trucking Associations estimates that the truck driving industry is roughly 80,000 drivers short of meeting current freight demand, and manufacturers are struggling to fill the nearly 500,000 job openings they currently offer. Pre-pandemic farmworker shortages only continue to worsen as crops across the U.S. go unharvested without sufficient labor. Not only are job vacancies contributing to major supply chain issues that are slowing economic recovery efforts—coupled with high demand, these shortages are contributing to rising consumer prices. Notably, these are occupations and industries that have had higher percentages of immigrants in their workforce in recent years. Immigrants make up 73% of farmworkers and nearly 20% of the workforce in both the manufacturing and transportation industries, yet during the pandemic, foreign-born populations experienced even higher unemployment compared to U.S.-born populations. Although a lot of media and political attention has been focused on the southern border and the increased encounters there, employers attempting to address job shortages by hiring foreign workers through proper, legal channels are facing unprecedented backlogs and delays at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. consular visa offices overseas. Of note, a recent Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General report noted that paper reliant procedures resulted in a 50% reduction in case completion from March to June 2020 at USCIS compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Furthermore, entry requirements, travel bans, and quarantine regulations have exacerbated the administrative delays. Both then-President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden issued bans on entry based on countries of origin at various times throughout the&hellip;",

    "content": "Since 2012, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has written an open letter to CEOs of companies who are part of BlackRock’s portfolio. However, like other influential wall street voices of the past, his letters to CEOs have influence well beyond those investments under his management. Part of the reason that his letters have such influence is that, as the largest institutional investor in the world, BlackRock now boasts managing over $10 trillion in assets. In short, when Larry Fink speaks people tend to listen. This year’s letter is about “stakeholder” capitalism, a company’s “social” purpose, and a call for CEOs to publicly engage on societal issues. The stakeholder capitalism he references is similar to that laid out by the Business Roundtable (BRT) in 2019. There, as BPC discussed, it was argued that successful companies don’t just look at profits and increasing value for shareholders, but rather look to their employees, suppliers, and the communities they operate as factors in their business decisions. It is debatable whether this was a new concept in 2019 or just a restatement of the position that to be successful, companies needed to take these other stakeholders into account. Larry Fink goes on to address the fundamental principle of a corporate “purpose” and appears to advocate for a noteworthy change. No longer are companies to focus merely on their charter or “business” purpose, but rather companies should also have a “social” purpose. Importantly their CEOs should be a leading voice on societal issues because that’s what he believes stakeholders want. In particular, employees “are increasingly looking to their employer as the most trusted, competent, and ethical source of information – more so than government, the media, and NGOs.” However, elevating CEOs as an authority for information may not sit well with those that believe that social issues should be left to elected officials, and that a CEO’s role should be to address materially relevant stakeholders while maximizing shareholder value. One concern with corporations addressing social issues is who determines the issues? Is it the CEO, the board, investors, or other stakeholders? Some argue that by focusing on materially relevant issues to a company’s long-term success collateral social issues can also be addressed. However, with the likely mandatory and prescriptive disclosure rules coming out of the SEC in the near term, CEOs that publicly weigh in on some societal issues, will certainly be pressured to make additional statements on other issues that may not be material to a company’s long-term success. This would almost certainly become more prevalent if CEOs become a “source of information.” Larry Fink argues that having a social purpose is not “about politics, or a social agenda, or even being woke.” However, the public perception of CEOs taking positions on social issues will likely be seen as a political or ideological agenda and may correspondingly have negative consequences. Even if CEOs deftly navigate responses to social issues, a more fundamental question arises under a stakeholder capitalism model. How does a CEO decide which stakeholder&hellip;",

    "content": "Texas is off to a rocky start implementing its new voting law, S.B. 1, enacted in 2021. Mail ballot applications are getting rejected by the hundreds, election officials’ hands are tied, and there’s a looming deadline for the March 1 primaries. Texas lawmakers should use this moment as lessons learned and act now to prevent excessive ballot rejections in November. The new legislation requires absentee voters to submit their driver’s license or state ID number on their mail ballot application. If a voter doesn’t have a DL or state ID number, they can submit the last four digits of their Social Security number, or a statement confirming that they do not have the required identification. However, these new ID requirements don&#8217;t mesh well with the information election officials have historically provided Texans about registering to vote. According to the Texas secretary of state’s office, about 702,257 voters have either an ID number or SSN on file with elections offices, but not both. In practice, that means a voter would have to know which number is on file when submitting their ballot application, lest they submit the wrong number and have their ballot get rejected. Texas’ restrictive mail voting rules mean that only certain populations are even eligible to vote by mail, thus reducing the potentially disenfranchising impact of this policy failure. “It is not unusual for primaries to have a higher than … other elections,” Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir remarked during a press conference, “But that’s really high.” DeBeauvoir reported having to reject roughly 27% of mail ballot applications so far this primary season. Harris County, Texas’ most populous county, has rejected roughly seven times more applications than usual. Good election policy anticipates downstream impacts. S.B. 1 was rammed through the legislative process largely without the input of local election officials. It’s unsurprising that counties are now unequipped to handle the unusually large amount of rejected applications resulting from the law’s policy changes. Texas lawmakers should take this oversight as an opportunity to strengthen voter registration and verification procedures. They can start by better incorporating the input of local election officials into the policymaking process—before implementation. To ensure fair and equitable access to the ballot, Texas should consider the following reforms ahead of the November election: New remote voter identity verification policies should be phased in, not implemented all at once. BPC has highlighted the potential for voter ID numbers to function as an alternative to signature verification, the current industry standard for verifying the identity of mail voters. However, states must ensure that election officials have the voter data on hand to verify identity without excessive, unnecessary rejections before the policy is implemented. States considering this alternative should phase the practice in to give voters and election officials time to adjust. Automatic Voter Registration can improve the quality of voter registration rolls. Since a driver’s license number and social security number are not both required to register to vote in Texas, a connection with the Department&hellip;",

    "content": "In November 2021, House Democrats passed the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Act, a social spending bill with significant funding for both existing and new housing programs. The legislation advanced through the budget reconciliation process without any Republican support in the House but hit a roadblock in the Senate before the end of 2021. Negotiations to craft legislation capable of garnering the requisite 50 Democratic votes in the Senate are ongoing. While the housing provisions in the BBBA have not been the most contentious aspects of the legislation, there could be cuts to housing funding, or elimination altogether, to reduce the bill’s overall cost. While HUD would receive about $150 billion through the BBBA, housing-related spending and tax credits across all agencies would cost over $220 billion. Below is an overview of top housing-related spending and tax provisions included in the BBBA, and what these investments could mean for housing in the United States. With the bill’s more challenging path out of the Senate, and reconciliation rules that limit provisions included in the bill mostly to those with a direct fiscal impact (as opposed to policy changes), House Democrats would likely pass the version of the bill that clears the Senate. As such, this blog focuses on the tax and spending provisions from the titles of the bill released by key Senate committees (namely Banking, Finance, Indian Affairs, and Homeland Security), which closely mirror the legislation passed by the House. For HUD, about 53% of BBBA funds constitute discretionary funding, and about 44% constitute formula funding, with the remaining funds for administrative costs, technical assistance, and capacity building. Across all agencies, 39% of the cost of housing-related spending and tax provisions in the BBBA are discretionary grant programs, 31% are formula grant programs, and 27% are tax expenditures. Public Housing—$65 Billion: Public housing is made up of affordable rental units available for low-income households. Currently, about 1.7 million people live in 932,000 public housing units, a figure that has declined in recent years due to demolition, deterioration, and conversion to properties with long-term contracts through the Rental Assistance Demonstration. Nearly half of the public housing stock nationwide was built before 1970, resulting in a significant maintenance and rehabilitation backlog ($26 billion when last assessed in 2010). Of all proposed BBBA funding on public housing, $2.5 billion would be directed to the Choice Neighborhoods program, which combines public and private funding to revitalize neighborhoods with public housing. This substantial investment to repair, replace, and develop properties is more than eight times the funding for the public housing program in fiscal year 2021. Housing Choice Vouchers and Project-Based Rental Assistance—$25 Billion: The vast majority ($24 billion) would be directed to Housing Choice Vouchers, which help low-income families cover the cost of rent for private, market-rate units in neighborhoods of their choice. Vouchers have proven to be effective at reducing homelessness and housing instability and improving economic opportunity for families, but the program is not an entitlement.

This includes the Civil Works division tasked with overseeing the construction, operation, and maintenance of many critical infrastructure systems, including navigation, water supply, flood and storm protection, and aquatic ecosystem restoration projects. Over the years, Congress has authorized new construction activities and projects but failed to fully appropriate the necessary funding—leading to a $100 billion backlog in authorized construction projects. Signed into law in November 2021, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act provided about $17 billion to the USACE—more than twice USACE’s appropriated funding of $7.8 billion for civil works in fiscal year 2021—to help address its project backlog. Of the IIJA funding, nearly 70% of the funds were designated to the Corps’ Construction account, the primary fund for new projects. Nearly 25% of the funds were directed to the Operation and Maintenance account, and another 5% were directed to an account for the Mississippi River and tributaries. USACE recently announced the projects it plans to fund in fiscal year 2022 with money from IIJA, including over $7 billion in construction. See the map of which states received construction funding below. Top priorities funded by the IIJA included flood risk management, waterway construction, and ecosystem restoration. For fiscal year 2022, USACE funded 22 new projects and plans to complete 19 construction projects and 15 feasibility studies. USACE also stated that, cumulatively, nearly $4 billion of its funding from IIJA will go towards enhancements of commercial navigation across coastal ports and inland waterways. Source: Congressional Research Service  The largest USACE project funded in 2022 was $1.1 billion for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration program, an effort to restore, protect, and preserve water resources in central and southern Florida. The SFER includes the comprehensive Everglades restoration program, which is the most expansive environmental restoration project in world history, according to USACE. Separate from the IIJA, the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act, passed in late September to provide continuing appropriations for federal agencies, included an additional $5.7 billion for USACE projects. The bill included $3 billion for flood and storm damage reduction, including $1.5 billion to states affected by Hurricane Ida.

I do not support actions that seek to divide us or undermine civic discourse for any reason.” Republican Bill Would Punish Universities, Technical Colleges for Free Speech Violations Rich Kremer | Wisconsin Public Radio | December 10, 2021 Wisconsin State Assembly representatives introduced a bill that “would punish Wisconsin state universities and technical colleges for free speech or academic freedom violations.” If passed, the bill would “allow state or federal courts, the state Higher Educational Aids Board, or state lawmakers to weigh evidence and decide if a college violated free speech rights.” Consequences for colleges could include financial penalties and the requirement to notify applicants that free speech policies had been violated.

Phil Murphy (D-NJ) signed S108 into law, making it the 15th state to adopt legislation modeled after the Student Press Law Center’s (SPLC) “New Voices Act.” The law “prohibits the censorship of student journalists except in narrow circumstances.” SPLC Executive Director Hadar Harris, while applauding the passage of the bill, critiqued the legislation for prohibiting profanity, commenting that the new law “encouraged school administrators to unconstitutionally restrict the use of profane speech when it is newsworthy.” Young Dems More Likely To Despise The Other Party Neal Rothschild | Axios | December 8, 2021 A Generation Lab/Axios poll finds nearly “a quarter of college students wouldn’t be friends with someone who voted for the other presidential candidate — with Democrats far more likely to dismiss people than Republicans.” The survey found 71% of Democrats and 31% of Republicans would not&hellip;",

    "content": "Self-censorship is a growing concern in higher education. In the last decade, professors have increasingly emphasized the threat posed by self-censorship to students’ ability to engage in open inquiry, appreciate viewpoint diversity, and even discuss uncomfortable scientific conclusions. Among professors, self-censorship has affected the ability to pursue controversial research, give lectures, and operate in a cordial faculty environment. Pressure from foreign countries has also led administrators and professors to self-censor. While some commentators have questioned whether campuses have a self-censorship problem, evidence continues to point toward a growing reluctance, particularly among students, to express themselves openly. On campus, within the larger academic community, and across the nation, self-censorship is growing. The centrality of universities and colleges to democracy, intellectual exchange, and the discovery and transmission of knowledge presents a useful opportunity to further examine the issue. Self-censorship is not a phenomenon unique to college campuses, nor is it always unhealthy. Different social contexts often limit the range of opinions and thoughts that are acceptable to utter; employers, for example, may reasonably limit staff from expressing their political views to customers and clients. However, in a free and open society, inhibition can be troublesome when found in an institution dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and intellectual exchange. When students in higher education willingly stop themselves from speaking or contributing to an important dialogue, it risks bankrupting the search for truth and undermining the academic ethos, placing the mission of the university in jeopardy. Throughout U.S. history, the character of self-censorship in the academy has exhibited qualitative differences in its source, motivations, methods, and impact. Examining this history among students reveals the patterns and changes that have occurred in self-censorship’s manifestation in higher education, and the challenges posed to properly analyzing and responding to it. The United States has a vigorous tradition of student activism. There have been periods when this tradition was under pressure, as when “rising anticommunist sentiment” inhibited “activism from returning to prewar levels” and engendered an era of self-censorship directed by federal, state, and local governments. Student protests reemerged with force by the late-1950s, with the rise of the desegregation movement, and expanded into the 1960s in a violent eruption across the country. These protests arose in response to the stifling of student political speech and expression, and were influenced by the Civil Rights Movement, feminism, and anti-Vietnam War sentiment. Key events such as the “Days of Rage” in Chicago marked the national impact of student activists as well as the turn toward violence. By the end of the decade, one poll showed that 44% of students “thought violence was sometimes justified to change society.” Despite the pro-free speech intentions of some student activists, the rise in censoriousness among the group was noted by one prominent professor in a 1969 essay in The Atlantic: “The right of unpopular political figures to speak without disruption on campus; the right of professors to give courses and lectures without disruption that makes it impossible for others to listen or to&hellip;",

    "content": "Housing costs—which are often a household’s primary expenditure—weigh heavily on consumers, leading to questions about how fast-rising rents and home prices contribute to inflation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures changes in topline inflation by tracking everyday household expenditures on goods and services, but it does not necessarily capture the full scope of trends in the housing market. There are many indices that track changes in home prices, using varying methodologies. Those most commonly used are repeat-sale indices because they control for the quality and newness of homes by measuring changes in the same house’s price over two sales. The S&#038;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, CoreLogic Home Price Index, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency House Price Index are all examples. For rental housing, the Zillow’s Observed Rental Index is among the most cited. It similarly calculates price differences for the same rental unit over time before aggregating those differences. Comparatively, the Consumer Price Index is a cost-of-living index, which measures the prices of a basket of hundreds of goods and services consumed by households, tracking these items’ price changes and assigning weighted averages based on their average share of total household expenditures. The CPI market basket does not include the cost of housing units because spending to purchase and improve housing is investment, not consumption. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does use its survey of consumers to collect and calculate the cost of shelter, which is the service that housing units provide. This important distinction results in key differences between home price indices and the shelter component of CPI (“CPI: Shelter”), which includes both rental costs and the consumption value of owner-occupied housing and comprises almost a third of the CPI basket. For rental housing, CPI is calculated using the price of rent for rental housing (“CPI: Rent”). For owner-occupied housing, CPI imputes the value to homeowners of “consuming” the shelter service that a home provides (known as “CPI: OER,” the owners’ equivalent rent of a primary residence), and which a homeowner forgoes by not renting the home to somebody else. OER is calculated using rental data and weighted by the price that homeowners think their home can be rented monthly, a calculation designed to reflect the value of a home more accurately as a shelter rather than investment. As shown in Figure 1, CPI: Shelter is the sum of CPI: Rent and CPI: OER. CPI: OER comprises roughly three-fourths of the shelter index, so its behavior is a major driver of shelter inflation. CPI: Shelter is then factored into the overall Consumer Price Index. It can be difficult for CPI to capture the rising cost of housing because the CPI is designed as a cost-of-living index that measures the prices of day-to-day household goods and services, not the value of household investment assets. The cost of housing is less volatile than other everyday goods in the CPI basket like groceries, gas, and clothing. Because leases and mortgages are typically fixed over long periods of time,&hellip;",

    "content": "If confirmed, Sandra Thompson will become the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship and the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Established in response to the financial crisis of 2008 as an independent regulatory agency, FHFA is responsible for oversight of the $7 trillion mortgage finance market. Decisions made by FHFA could play an important role in facilitating or impeding stated Biden administration goals, from increasing the supply of affordable homes to addressing persistent racial and ethnic gaps in the homeownership rate. BPC asked members of our Housing Council, a bipartisan group of over 20 housing experts, to share their most pressing questions as the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs considers the nomination of Sandra Thompson to be the next FHFA Director. Read their questions below: The GSEs are responsible for providing needed liquidity and stability to the housing markets, as well as supporting safe and affordable housing. Given the complexity and scale of risks associated with the mission of the GSEs, how will you ensure that they recruit and retain talent, as well as boost employee morale during these challenging times? A year ago, the Biden Administration published an executive order, which specifically identified minority communities and poor rural communities as the people and places that our government has historically disadvantaged through our laws and public policy choices. These communities are spread across the country, not only in our biggest cities. Large concentrations of poverty exist in rural places like Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, Indian Country, and along our Southern Border in the Colonias. Many of these underserved rural communities are also Black, Latino, and Native American. Eighty-five percent of “persistent poverty” counties in the United States are rural. More than 21 million Americans live in these counties, and 60% of them are racial and ethnic minorities. FHFA, and the GSEs that it oversees, have a crucial role to play in revitalizing these communities and helping all Americans have access to the American Dream. Building on the equitable finance plans and other initiatives FHFA announced in September, what will you do to challenge the GSEs to more effectively serve these minority communities, underserved rural communities, and the first-time homebuyers who call them home? How will you lead FHFA to strengthen “duty to serve” to achieve more meaningful capital flow to these communities?  First-time, and especially first-generation, low-income homebuyers face an uphill battle when it comes to achieving the dream of homeownership, especially if they reside in a rural area. FHFA and the GSEs have been working to make that uphill battle a little easier over the past several years, often in partnership with on-the-ground nonprofit organizations that work with prospective homebuyers directly. The GSEs have developed borrower considerations and product enhancements to make mortgages more obtainable and affordable, but nonprofits are still reporting that these changes have not been game changers for the people and areas they serve. In fact, many nonprofits have found it necessary to&hellip;",

    "content": "The realities of the post-pandemic labor market include: Remote or telework, Rapid changes in technology and globalization, and High turnover and employees seeking more fulfilling opportunities. Since the start of the pandemic in January 2020, workforce trends are evolving at an unprecedented rate. Short-term changes that occurred because of COVID-19 are expected to develop into long-term, revolutionary gains, while changes in technology and globalization are expected to continue accelerating. Employers are experiencing more turnover than ever before, with employees seeking more fulfilling opportunities and looking for changes after nearly two years of uncertainty. As Millennials and Gen Z employees begin to dominate the workforce, they will demand economic security and stability and workplace freedom and flexibility. An element that isn’t frequently discussed enough is how these workforce changes will necessitate a thoughtful design of the services needed to support employers and employees – including options for child care. This blog summarizes available data and research on the changing nature of workplaces, workers, the issues impacting our nation’s economic success, and reflects on how a reimagined child care and early education system can better meet these changes. A 2020 McKinsey &#038; Company report on the future of remote work summarized that the pandemic “accelerate a workplace experiment that had struggled to gain traction before COVID-19 hit.” According to Census data, in 2019, fewer than 6% of Americans worked primarily from home, flash forward a few months (May 2020) and about 35% were doing so. Workers and businesses within certain industries are much more likely to have the option: for instance, 57% of workers in management and professional occupations were working from home in May 2020. Amid significant productivity gains and a changing culture, it is likely that many companies will continue to employ a hybrid or entirely virtual model for their workers in the years to come. An April 2021 survey by the Conference Board found that a strong majority (87%) of employers are willing to hire primarily virtual or remote workers, up from less than half a year prior. The McKinsey report found that over 20% of the workforce can continue to work remotely three to five days of the week without any loss in productivity or effectiveness. Our own survey with Morning Consult conducted in May 2021 found that a majority (58%) of working parents with children under age five were able to work at least a portion of their week remotely, and in the future, 60% want to work remotely at least part of the week, including 29% who wish to work remotely full-time. These changes will have a profound impact on urban economies, transportation needs, consumer spending, and importantly on the need for child care. For instance, 70% of businesses anticipate reducing their real estate footprint in the next two years, which will impact modes of transportation and businesses in urban and business centers. Less of a need to travel to work will also impact the location parents want child care. Concurrently, half of the workforce has&hellip;",

    "content": "Policymakers, investors, and concerned Americans of all stripes let out a collective sigh of relief in December, when Congress struck a deal to advance legislation raising the debt limit by $2.5 trillion. The debt limit now stands at a record $31.4 trillion, with the nation’s public debt equal to the size of its economy and growing rapidly. The deal reached last month by congressional leaders ended the most recent debt limit episode and averted a crisis—for now. Yet the United States will keep accruing debt and will likely face another run-in with the debt limit next year. It will be Groundhog Day once again. Debt limit brinkmanship has become a recurring pastime for Congress. Seven times in the past decade the U.S. federal government has narrowly avoided a potentially catastrophic default on federal obligations. In 2021 alone, the country twice flirted with the “X Date”—the point at which the United States would no longer be able to meet all of its obligations in full and on time. While brinkmanship may score political points, it also inflicts real harm on the economy and American taxpayers. In 1979, after a debt limit showdown and technical glitches caused the Treasury Department to delay 4,000 payments on maturing securities totaling an estimated $122 million, short-term interest rates spiked by approximately 60 basis points. The 2011 debt limit episode increased the department’s borrowing costs by hundreds of millions of dollars and led Standard &amp; Poor’s to downgrade the U.S. long-term sovereign credit rating for the first time. In recent episodes, interest rates for four-week Treasury bills that matured around the X Date jumped noticeably. Approaching the X Date carries financial costs, but crossing it could wreak much worse havoc. Although the Treasury Department may be able to prioritize certain payments—such as interest and principal on the debt—an immediate cash-flow shortage would force the federal government to miss or delay critical obligations. These could include programs that touch nearly every American, from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to military and federal salaries and veterans’ benefits. Even a short-term default on U.S. debt could tank the nation’s credit rating, shock the global financial system, and call into question the U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. A default would also likely batter retirement accounts as well as the broader stock market. In the face of these potentially disastrous consequences, why does the current process for raising the debt limit persist? The most common answer—that the debt limit acts as a check on federal borrowing—has proven false. Under both parties, Congress has enacted policies that are driving up deficits, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. Other budget agreements directly attached an extension of the debt limit to bipartisan increases in defense and domestic agency spending. The purported benefits of the debt limit have not materialized in recent years, while the costs have become clear. To durably protect the full&hellip;",

    "content": "Policymakers have started heavily scrutinizing large technology firms’ merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity. Critics allege these acquisitions have stifled innovation and hurt competition, while supporters argue they have done the opposite and are a net benefit for society. The debates around tech company acquisitions and antitrust policy are complex and nuanced, and rigorous study of these issues is necessary to make better policy. This blog aims to highlight some of the main points of this debate. M&amp;A plays a key role in a modern economy,1 and competition authorities monitor M&amp;A activity to help ensure they are procompetitive and do not result in excess market power and anticompetitive behavior. Companies can engage in M&amp;A activities for a variety of reasons. For instance, companies might want to acquire new technology and capabilities, enter a new market, or reach a certain scale. M&amp;A activity can affect the competitiveness of a market in a number of ways. For instance, a merger can increase the efficiency of the combined firms by allowing them to leverage each other’s technology to create better products and services for consumers, or it can result in the new firm gaining excess market power that it abuses to the detriment of consumers. Competition authorities can review M&amp;A activity to determine the net effect and assess whether to use its powers to block a merger or acquisition or seek other remedies to address any potential harmful effects. Congress grants the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) authority to enforce U.S. antitrust laws, which includes the ability to review M&amp;A activity2 and take enforcement action where the effect “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.” For a merger or acquisition that raises competition concerns, the relevant competition authority can try to block it through litigation, or allow it to go through if certain negotiated conditions are met; for example, a merger could be allowed if the firm agrees to sell off certain parts of its business. Large technology companies’ M&amp;A activity over the past decade and the effects on competition have become a major flashpoint in current antitrust debates about large digital platforms. In 2020, the House Subcommittee on Antitrust majority staff published a report on “competition in digital markets,” reviewing activity by major tech companies, including their acquisitions. For instance, the report noted major acquisitions, including Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012, Amazon’s acquisition of Quidsi (Diapers.com) in 2010, and Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick, in 2007. The report expressed serious concerns about acquisition strategies in the technology sector stifling competition, however, the report’s critics argued it misunderstood the role acquisitions play in fostering innovation. Two academic papers have received considerable attention on the topic of M&amp;A and are both cited by the House report. The first is a paper by Colleen Cunningham, Florian Ederer, and Song Ma, focused on what they call “killer acquisitions.” These are acquisitions by incumbents designed to discontinue innovation projects and take out potential competitors.

    "content": "The expanded Child Tax Credit constituted one of the most significant policy changes in the American Rescue Plan (ARP), passed along party lines last March. Intended to further assist families with the cost of raising children, the revamped credit reduced child poverty but also raised concerns over its budgetary cost and connection to work. With Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and the White House at an impasse over the expanded credit’s future in Democrats’ Build Back Better Act, the CTC’s fate remains uncertain. This gridlock, however, can be remedied with a compromise: permanent expansion of the CTC that not only puts caregivers and their children first, but better targets the credit’s support and curbs its cost. The CTC has traditionally been a hallmark of bipartisan success. It was established in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under President Bill Clinton and expanded by each president since. The ARP included a one-year expansion of the CTC and eliminated the credit’s refundability cap and phase-in, thereby increasing access among households with little or no earnings. It also boosted the size of the credit for most families to $3,000 per child (or $3,600 for children under age 6) and paid a portion of the 2021 credit monthly instead of holding the full amount until tax filing season. Prior to that, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), Republicans had doubled the maximum credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and increased the refundable credit amount, while significantly raising the income level at which the credit phases out to $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for married filers. The TCJA also paired expansion of the CTC with the repeal of the personal exemption and other reforms to the tax code—changes that are set to expire at the end of 2025. To help policymakers find a path forward on permanent expansion of the CTC, the Bipartisan Policy Center has released a package of reforms that would overcome this era of overlapping, temporary changes to the credit and instead provide lasting support to American families. The proposal would increase the CTC’s value, compared to permanent law, to $2,200 per child (or $2,800 for children under age 6), better target the credit, expand access to families most in need, and retain the credit’s connection to work and the strong anti-poverty impacts of encouraging employment. It achieves this by eliminating the refundability cap and making a portion of the credit fully available regardless of income, phasing in the remainder of the credit with the first dollar of earnings, and lowering the current phase-out levels to $150,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married filers, among other recommendations, such as continuing to make the credit available on a monthly basis. BPC’s plan is fiscally sustainable. Its 10-year price tag of approximately $800 billion is nearly half the equivalent cost of the proposed CTC reform in the Build Back Better reconciliation bill if extended for 10 years. When further paired with permanently extending the TCJA’s repeal of the exemption for&hellip;",

    "content": "Science tells us that, in addition to making severe cuts in carbon emissions, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is essential to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. CDR approaches range from highly technological like direct air capture to natural solutions via enhancing natural processes in forests and soils. But there is another critical component to the carbon cycle that calls for serious CDR attention: oceans. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the oceans are one of the world’s most effective carbon sinks, capturing around one-third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution. Per unit volume, seawater can store 150 times more carbon than air, suggesting that there is enormous potential to utilize the oceans as a means of mitigating the effects of climate change. Oceans are also providers of global and local economic benefit. They provide direct output through fishing and agriculture, facilitate trade and transport, and provide for productive coastlines through conservation activities, tourism, and local jobs. The World Wildlife Foundation values these activities to be over $24 trillion in combined assets. However, the rising atmospheric carbon dioxide level is causing the oceans to absorb more carbon than they can handle, and is subsequently harming sensitive marine life such as corals and shellfish. Compared to preindustrial times, the overall surface water pH has declined by approximately 25%, a process known as ocean acidification. These impacts to ocean health could cost a global economic decline on the order of $428 billion annually by 2050. Figure 1: Schematic representation of  six different oceans CDR pathways taken from the NASEM 2021 report. Considering how productive of a carbon sink the oceans are, ocean CDR presents tremendous opportunities to enable our net-zero goals. There are many ocean CDR strategies, ranging from increasing biomass in coastal ecosystems, to direct carbon removal from seawater, that warrant serious consideration. Each of these solutions differs in terms of readiness, cost, and carbon-removal capabilities. Nonetheless, the sheer carbon removal potential of the following strategies indicate that ocean carbon removal strategies must be considered as a part of any climate solution moving forward. Fortunately, the National Academies for Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently released a report that details a research agenda to assess the benefits, risks, and potential for responsible scale-up of ocean CDR approaches. It provides important research recommendations and considerations for six distinct forms of using oceans for carbon removal, shown in figure 1. Ecosystem Recovery (Blue Carbon) Blue carbon is defined as carbon that is naturally stored in marine and coastal ecosystems but generally refers to mangrove forests, salt marshes, and seagrass beds. Blue carbon removal is reminiscent of terrestrial plant-based carbon removal strategies. Coastal aquatic ecosystems do an especially good job of sequestering and storing carbon. Through photosynthesis, these plants can store carbon in their biomass, but are even more effective at storing carbon in their dense soils for potentially thousands of years. Thus, a relatively straightforward CDR approach is to restore these habitats. One such project is the Kaimana Coastal Conservation&hellip;",

Here is a roundup of what some experts are saying about Omicron, boosters, and a potential end to the pandemic. Dr. Anand Parekh, BPC chief medical advisor, was asked on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal about the Omicron variant and what still needs to be understood: Dr. Leana Wen, BPC board member and former Baltimore Health Commissioner, spoke about mitigation measures and her advice for the Biden administration in a recent episode of BPC Weekly: “I would urge President Biden to go much further with the other measures that we already know to be effective. So definitely encouraging everyone to get boosters at this point. This is not a question of waiting to get boosters or seeing boosters as a luxury. It’s time to see boosters as being absolutely essential and President Biden has already urged people to get boosters, but I think they can go even further and potentially change the definition of what it means to be fully vaccinated to include having the booster dose.” White House COVID advisor and NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci was asked when we might evolve to more of endemic environment: “The trick is what level in that bracket of endemicity are we going to wind up at? Are we going to be at a very, very low level where we barely even notice it sort of like those kinds of infections in the community that are there, it makes a few people sick, but it doesn&#8217;t impact what we do? Or is it going to be high enough that we&#8217;re always going to have to be careful that we&#8217;re going to get a resurgence. Obviously, the optimum would be get so low that we can start to really return to what we feel is as close to normal as we can. When we get there… is going to depend entirely on us, how well we vaccinate the public, how well we get boosters to people because we know that the vaccine efficacy clearly wanes. … If we can get most of the people who are eligible to be boosted boostered, we can go a long way to making 2022 much more of a normal year than what we&#8217;ve seen in 2021.” BPC’s health team has their finger on the pulse of the latest COVID developments. Stay tuned as we all wait and see if 2022 will be the year we transition out of&hellip;",

    "content": "The growing need for mental health and substance use services in the U.S. is shining a spotlight on an already alarming inability to get care. Before the pandemic, almost 1 in 5 Americans were experiencing mental illness, with over half of them not receiving treatment. As the Omicron variant creates a new wave of fatigue and feelings of hopelessness, mental illness rates continue to rise, emphasizing the need to strategically—and quickly—increase the availability of providers. Yet, a surprisingly important question is which providers. Psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and other behavioral specialists may seem the obvious focus, and indeed they are an important source of help for people in need, especially those with severe mental illness. However, primary care providers also require attention. In fact, 39% of people who received behavioral health services from 2020 to 2021 did so through a primary care provider. That’s not far off from those who got treatment through a specialist (45%), according to a poll BPC conducted with Morning Consult in May 2021. Often it is less expensive to get care through a primary care provider; there is limited participation of behavioral health providers in insurance networks. People are also more likely to express mental health concerns with a provider that they trust and see regularly for their physical health concerns, which helps reduce stigma. Patients are more comfortable receiving care if the provider is also culturally competent and can meet their cultural and linguistic needs; communities of color and those with limited English proficiency tend to turn more to primary care providers to access health care services. With these issues in mind, BPC’s Behavioral Health Integration Task Force recently released a report with federal policy recommendations that would create a clear pathway for primary care and behavioral health integration, with a strong focus on providing primary care providers with the supports they need to handle some of the mild to moderate behavioral health care needs of their patients. Although 60-80% of all primary care visits include a behavioral health component, part of the unmet need for services is a lack of primary care providers willing to treat these conditions. While many providers screen, diagnose, and treat the mild to moderate conditions, they report often feeling overwhelmed and ill-equipped to meet their patients’ behavioral health needs. To incentivize and enable primary care clinicians to take on a greater role in providing behavioral health care to their patients, they will need training, technical assistance, and access to a larger pool of behavioral health providers for both consultations and referrals. Many behavioral health and primary care providers operate in silos without sufficient incentive or financial flexibility to integrate services. Reforming payment structures and adopting alternative payment models could provide financial incentives for more providers to participate in integration models. The task force recommended focusing first on risk-bearing payment models, which already have structural elements that make them an ideal home for integrated care.

    "content": "The world has seen a significant leap in the growth in the number of laws dealing with competition over the last few years. From only 12 jurisdictions around the world having had a competition law in 1970, there are now more than 125 that maintain a competition law regime, with the vast majority of them conducting active competition enforcement activities (OECD, 2020). This brief provides an overview of the competition law landscape in five major, influential jurisdictions over the last few years, and how ongoing developments therein could impact the future of competition law in the years to come. For each of the jurisdictions, the technology sector plays an important role in their national economy and has a significant presence of US tech firms. Part of the reason why we choose to highlight these legal frameworks is that they are actively working to regulate the sector, which has an impact on how US companies operate in general. The origins of modern competition law roots back to the United States’ enactment of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. Courts have interpreted Congress’s intention as enacting a “comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade” aimed at prohibiting monopolistic business activities, then referred to as trusts. It was followed in 1914 by the Clayton Antitrust Act, which addressed price discrimination, exclusive dealing, interlocking directorates, and acquisitions of competing companies through stock purchases. The same year also saw the enactment of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It shares antitrust enforcement with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which can prosecute certain violations of antitrust laws by filing criminal cases. In addition to these federal laws, most states also have antitrust legislation that is enforced by state attorneys general. Private enforcement, however, comprises the majority of antitrust litigation in the US, wherein competitors, suppliers, and customers seek damages for injuries caused by anti-competitive conduct. The competition law of the European Union is codified under Articles 101 to 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The treaty covers prohibitions on agreements that have the object or effect of restricting competition, abuse of dominance, and state aid. Apart from this main instrument, other rules, guidelines, and notices have also been issued to regulate other areas such as mergers and concentrations. The primary enforcer of these rules is the European Commission, which is responsible for functions including fact-finding, taking action against infringements, and imposing penalties. Actions for annulment of Commission decisions in competition cases are first brought to the General Court, while appeals are heard by the Court of Justice. EU competition law is often applied by the Commission and the EU courts with consideration of single European market integration (European Parliament, 2019). The member states also have their own domestic competition laws, modeled after Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU, and domestic enforcement activities are undertaken by the 27 National Competition Authorities.&hellip;",

    "content": "There are rumors and whispers in some corners of Washington about the possibility of another round of federal assistance for small businesses. It’s unclear how likely this is to materialize. It is clear, however, that the idea is in the air and being promoted by some on and off Capitol Hill. The Build Back Better (BBB) Act includes $5 billion in additional spending for small business support. While not an immediate form of assistance in the same vein as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), some BBB provisions would inject new funding to support certain types of small businesses over a period of several years. There is speculation that Congress might authorize further targeted relief, along the lines of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund or Shuttered Venues Operators Grant. Here, we briefly discuss some of the reasons and supporting arguments for whether Congress should, or should not, allocate more money now for small business relief. YES: Small Businesses Need More Help Things are getting harder, not better, for small businesses—and it’s possible that the BBB Act won’t become law. The October Small Business Economic Trends report from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) found a quickening slide in small business optimism. On balance, a net negative 37% of small business owners expected better business conditions in the next six months. Why? One simple reason: inflation! In the latest Small Business Pulse Survey reading from the Census Bureau, earlier this month, three-quarters of small businesses said they were facing “large” or “moderate” price increases for goods and services. Rising costs are driven by supply chain complications. Forty-four percent said they were experiencing domestic supplier delays—compared to just 29% in August 2020. Because of these challenges, 36% of small businesses in the Pulse Survey still don’t expect full recovery for at least another six months. NO: Small Business Recovery is Underway Have you looked at Peloton’s stock lately? At the time of this writing, it’s down over 70% since the beginning of this year. Sales growth is down, its revenue forecast dark. One big reason is that more Americans have been returning, in-person, to the gym—and many fitness centers are small businesses that struggled mightily during the worst of the pandemic. Americans have also been eating out at restaurants more frequently. And going to the movies. And going to axe-throwing bars. And pretty much any other leisure activity you can name. The “social distancing” spending tracked by JPMorgan Chase shows steadily rising card present expenditures on retail, lodging, restaurants, parks, theaters, and other recreational services. That means people paying for things in person, at the box office or their table. By late autumn, in fact, such spending was 10% above its pre-pandemic level. The biggest problem for small businesses right now is the very tight labor market: namely, finding qualified workers for the jobs that employers want and need to fill. In both the NFIB report and a recent “State of the Workforce” release from MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, nearly&hellip;",

    "content": "Securing safe and affordable housing is a struggle for far too many families. The lack of available, affordable homes nationwide drives up prices for renters and homeowners, leading to unsustainable cost burdens while hampering the ability of families to save and build wealth. This post provides a brief overview of the urgent need to expand the supply of homes, particularly those affordable to low-income renters and entry-level homebuyers. The nation’s housing shortage has continually worsened since the early 2000s, with new housing production lagging behind population growth. In 2021, the nation faced an estimated shortage of 5.5 million to 6.8 million units. Closing this housing supply gap will not only help more families afford their housing, it will also strengthen the economy as a whole. According to one estimate, constructing 550,000 new units annually over the next 10 years would generate $411 billion in new economic activity through greater labor mobility, new tax revenue, and associated economic growth. The United States suffers from a severe undersupply of affordable rental homes that fails to meet demand nationwide. Every state in the nation is impacted by this demand-supply imbalance, with the number of low-cost units falling from 33% of the total market in 2012 to less than 25% in 2017. For every 100 low-income households, there are only about 55 affordable, available, and adequate homes; for every 100 extremely low-income households, there are only about 36. The lack of affordable options forces families to pay unsustainable rents that can lead to housing instability. Over the past 20 years, average rent prices rose by 13%, adjusted for inflation, with similar increases in almost every state and outpacing wage growth. Today, the average monthly rent for a modest two-bedroom apartment is over $1,200, about twice as much as many families of four with poverty-level incomes can afford. As of 2019, HUD found 7.77 million renters faced “Worst Case Needs,” which HUD defines as paying more than one-half of income for rent or living in severely inadequate conditions. High rents weigh heavily on a low-income household’s finances. Seventy percent of extremely low-income renter households, those making less than 30% of the area median, spend more than half of their incomes just on rent and utilities. After paying rent, the median renter earning less than $15,000 annually has about $410 left each month for other essentials such as food and health care. Heavily rent-burdened households are constantly at risk of falling behind and facing eviction, as the loss of a job, the death or departure of a working household member, or a major medical crisis could make rent impossible to afford. Unaffordable rents also prevent families from saving to buy a home. These rent burdens impact households of color particularly hard: 54% of Black renters and 52% of Hispanic renters spend more than 30% of their income on rent, compared to only 42% of white renters. After decades of decline, the supply of entry-level housing is far too low to meet the rising demand of first-time&hellip;",

The significant investments in clean energy and billions of dollars dedicated to the demonstration and deployment of advanced technologies included in the law places us at a critical moment in the effort to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In the coming years, the DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO) will play a crucial role in advancing the commercialization of key technologies vital to our nation&#8217;s economic and climate goals. In March of this year, Jigar Shah joined the Department of Energy as the Director of LPO, where he oversees $40 billion in loans and loan guarantees to help deploy clean energy technologies. Streamlining the application process and reducing burdens for businesses is part of Shah&#8217;s plan to signal to the private sector that LPO is &#8220;open for business,&#8221; he said during a recent fireside chat with Sasha Mackler, Executive Director of BPC&#8217;s Energy Program. While risk is an inherent part of the innovation cycle, the due diligence LPO performs before issuing a loan or loan guarantee communicates to potential investors that an innovative energy project carries a low level of risk and high level of legitimacy. This catalyzation of private sector investment is incredibly important for scaling up and commercializing clean energy technologies. During the event, Shah discussed this aspect of LPO&#8217;s mission, the office&#8217;s role in overcoming the &#8220;valley of death&#8221; when deploying key technologies, and what success looks like with new funding now in hand.",

Our big read features one scholar’s experience with core texts and why they are important in liberal arts education. Iowa Board of Regents Initiates Survey to Assess State of Free Speech on Campuses Cleo Krejci| Iowa City Press-Citizen | November 9, 2021 At the Iowa Board of Regent’s direction, faculty, students, and staff at Iowa’s three public universities were surveyed about the state of free speech on campus. The survey asked respondents to rate “the extent to which they feel able to express opinions at their university and whether they feel faculty and administration are welcoming of differing opinions, among other questions.” The survey is part of a broader initiative by the regents’ committee on free speech, which includes a policy review and new training. An Accreditor Tells an Institution to Do Better on Academic Freedom. Will More Follow? Peter Bonilla | Foundation for Individual Rights in Education | November 12, 2021 The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) placed Southwest Baptist University on probation out of concern that the institution was not upholding academic freedom. In a letter to the university’s president, the accrediting agency charged that the institution was failing to comply with three of the “Core Components.” The HLC pointed to proposed policy changes “to tenure requirements, board composition, and ‘statements of faith’” that would have undermined free expression and academic freedom. Duke Student Government Senators Uphold Veto of Students Supporting Israel After Nearly 3-Hour Session Nadia Bey and Audrey Wang | The Chronicle | November 18, 2021 The Duke Student Government (DSG) voted 37-3, with 10 abstentions, to uphold its president’s veto of recognition of Duke Students Supporting Israel (Duke SSI). After DSG granted a charter to Duke SSI, a student took to social media to criticize the group; in turn, a member of Duke SSI responded to the critique on social media. In vetoing the Duke SSI’s charter, DSG president pointed to that social media retort, saying it was “unacceptable for any student group and appeared antithetical to the group’s stated mission to be welcoming and inclusive to all Duke students.” Duke University President Vincent Price and Provost Sally Kornbluth released a statement saying the vote “has raised concerns about whether students have been treated in accordance with University policy that prohibits discrimination and harassment, which includes anti-Semitism.” Academic Freedom: UF Faculty Senate Study Finds Broad Fear of Reprisal for Criticism Douglas Ray | The Gainesville Sun | December 6, 2021 An ad-hoc committee of University of Florida Faculty Senate released its report on the state of academic freedom on the campus, including freedom to engage in extramural activities. The report described instances when “faculty members said they had been discouraged from pursuing controversial areas of research, writing opinion columns for publications and other activities perceived as unpopular with politicians in Tallahassee… to a certain extent, faculty often engaged in self-censorship and chose not to ‘rock the boat’ for fear of retaliation.” Protests&hellip;",

    "content": "The European Union has been actively working on setting standards for topics related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The EU’s recent focus has primarily been on environmental issues, but they have also touched on elements of social and governance. The decisions made in Europe can have impacts that go beyond their borders, therefore understanding how the EU is approaching ESG is important. BPC has created the graphic and guide below to help familiarize people with several key concepts from Europe’s approach to ESG. Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD): NFRD refers to a 2014 EU directive on non-financial reporting that applies to a subset of companies based on “the average number of employees, balance sheet total and net turnover.” The directive requires covered businesses to report on certain environmental and social factors. The NFRD introduced the principle of double materiality, whereby a company discloses material financial information and information about the effects a company or entity has on society and the environment. The NFRD is set to be replaced by the CSRD. Commission action plan on financing sustainable growth: The action plan was adopted by the European commission in March 2018 and is a strategy to connect finance with sustainability. The action plan includes key components like setting up the EU taxonomy and creating an EU green bond standard. The European Green Deal: The European Green Deal was presented in December 2019 and is a plan by the European Commission to tackle climate change and other environmental issues. The stated goals include “no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050,” “economic growth decoupled from resource use,” and “no person and no place left behind.” The European Green Deal sets a target of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. EU taxonomy: The EU taxonomy is a classification system to categorize investment activity based on their sustainability and help the EU reach the goals set in the European Green Deal. The taxonomy regulation was published in June 2020 and went into force in July 2020. The taxonomy lists six environmental objectives: “climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.” EU Sustainability Reporting Standards: European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is tasked by the European Commission to study developing EU sustainability reporting standards. EFRAG currently put out two reports in March 2021. The first report is a roadmap for developing EU sustainability reporting standards. The second report provides proposed reforms to EFRAG’s governance structure with the goal of ensuring standards are developed based on an inclusive and rigorous process. Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR): SFDR is a regulation that became effective in March 2021. The regulation sets disclosure requirements on financial services firms pertaining to sustainability factors. Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD): The CRSD is a proposal adopted by the European Commission in April 2021 and will amend the reporting requirements under NFRD.

Tropical cyclones made up 64% of the total costs from weather and climate disasters this year, as of October. After another particularly busy start to the season, the Atlantic Coast experienced an unusual lack of hurricanes in November. A tropical cyclone is a system of clouds and thunderstorms that originates over tropical waters, often with very intense wind force. There are three types of tropical cyclones: Tropical Depression: maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less Tropical Storm: maximum sustained winds of 39-73 mph; once a tropical cyclone reaches wind speeds of 39 mph it becomes a named storm Hurricane: maximum sustained winds of 74 mph or greater; major hurricanes have speeds of 111 mph or higher Source: Tropical Atlantic  2021 was the third most active year of tropical storms and hurricanes on record, and the sixth consecutive season with above average tropical cyclone activity. While the 2021 season had fewer billion-dollar disasters than 2020, 2021 was more costly and more deadly because of Hurricane Ida, a devastating storm that killed nearly 100 people and has so far led to about $65 billion in damages, with some analysts estimating a final total cost of $95 billion. Sixteen years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, Hurricane Ida hit Louisiana with sustained winds of 150 mph, having increased by 65 mph in the 24-hour period prior to landfall. Ida left more than 1 million Louisiana residents without power, including the entire city of New Orleans. Twenty-six people died in Louisiana alone, many due to carbon monoxide poisoning or improper evacuation from nursing homes. The federal response to Hurricane Ida provides an example of the roles different agencies play and the comprehensive measures demanded for hurricane response. President Biden approved major disaster declarations for Hurricane Ida in Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, making federal aid available for those states. As the primary agency tasked with early disaster response, FEMA approved over $660 million in assistance for families in the first month after the disaster. This included rental assistance, assistance to repair damaged dwellings, and other needs such as medical and childcare costs. FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) paid nearly $77 million to homeowners with damaged homes. FEMA also provided temporary housing to nearly 20,000 households in hotels and motels, and provided meals, water, tarps, and energy generators. Other agencies also played a crucial role in early response efforts. In the first month after the disaster: The Small Business Administration provided over $200 million in low-interest disaster loans to businesses HUD provided foreclosure relief and made new mortgage insurance available The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed more than 9,000 blue roofs so families could stay in their damaged homes while under repair, and brought in planning and&hellip;",

I would ask this as we tail-end millennials and high-end Gen Zers have experienced what many would consider more than our fair share of existential, uncontrollable, and terrifying threats at younger, more vulnerable ages than most. We have lived through the terrorist attacks of 9/11 while in elementary school and school shootings from elementary school through college. We have grown to accept the reality that the irreversible impacts of climate change not wrought solely by our generations are now ours with which to deal. And now we are enduring the ongoing global pandemic that many experts suggest is here to stay. At ages 18 to 29, we are barely into adulthood. All of this is to say that Harvard’s recent Youth Poll findings are, for most of us millennials and Gen Zers, completely unsurprising: 51% of us responded to having felt down, depressed, and hopeless—data that is in line with both CDC and NIH findings that depression and anxiety rates are more common and growing more among our age range than any other group. These findings also track with recent data related to substance use and the U.S. opioid epidemic which continues unabated, impacting millennials at higher rates than all other age groups. This is part of the reason BPC’s work on integrating care is so important. The integration of primary care, mental health, and substance use services enhances access to behavioral health treatments and improves patient outcomes; Congress is likely to consider legislation to this effect in the coming year. Confronting existing and continuing workforce shortages should also be at the top of our minds, as should positioning our health system for the next pandemic. Still, only time will tell if we 18- to-29-year-olds grow out of these rates of depression and anxiety with age or, even better, if we can accomplish something meaningful with our collective unease. And I hope we do, as millennials alone have recently overtaken baby boomers as America’s largest generation; and because of a glimmer of hope in Harvard’s Youth Poll: 43% of respondents—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike—prefer that their elected leaders meet in the middle on issues at the expense of the policy priorities favored by their respective parties. This means that, should we be able to transform our widely shared anxieties and increase our generation’s level of civic engagement, we stand to have the largest political impact in years to come and, I hope, be the most bipartisan group of voters in decades.",

    "content": "The findings from BPC’s latest report, The Economic Impact of the Child Care Gap, show that the country’s lack of access to formal child care for 3.4 million children in 35 states, including the District of Columbia, could cost the United States an estimated $142 billion to $217 billion in economic productivity over the next 10 years. In 2020 using the most comprehensive child care supply dataset to date, BPC calculated that 31.7% of children under six with all parents in the labor force come from families without access to formal child care facilities—America’s child care gap. After discovering the child care gap for children below six with all parents in the workforce, BPC calculated the economic benefit of filling the gap, versus the economic cost of failing to do so. The findings in this report show that the country’s lack of access to formal child care for 3.4 million children in 35 states including the D.C costs the U.S. an estimated $142 billion to $217 billion in economic productivity over the next 10 years. The report provides the first known estimates of the burden imposed on the U.S. economy by the country’s gaps in child care. The report identifies and monetizes the impact that the child care gap has on families, businesses, and tax revenue. The analysis estimates one year’s economic loss to each entity plus the residual burden over the next 10 years. The economic impact of the child care gap also varies by state . The chart below shows the low and high estimates of the sums of burdens on households, businesses, and tax revenues for each state. With data quantifying the cost to the economy of each individual gap in the child care supply and an interactive map that provides such findings by state, congressional district, and county, policymakers now have a starting point from they can begin to estimate the return on investment of building our country’s child care supply. Policymakers and advocates can use this data to calculate the potential return on their investments in closing the country’s child care gap. Note: BPC recognizes that child care gaps in rural and urban areas can vary greatly. Our most recent survey focused on child care in rural America and can be found here. It is important to keep a few things in mind, our findings represent: The economic impact of potential gaps in the child care supply, not the impact of other child care issues like unaffordability or actual demand; The economic impact of potential gaps in only 35 states, including DC, not all 50 states; An estimated range for the impact over 10 years, not one single estimate. To learn more about the methodology and findings, please read our full report. Additionally, engage with our interactive child care gap map to learn more about the gap in your state.",

    "content": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) released its border data for September 2021 on October 22, 2021, wrapping up a fiscal year that saw record high numbers of border encounters in all reported demographic categories. Total encounters at the border for the year reached nearly 1.66 million, as seen in Figure 1, which tops the previous record of 1.645 million from FY2000. However, further details in the data show a continuation of several recent trends, including high rates of repeated attempted crossings by individuals, higher numbers of single adults even as families continue to arrive, and a further diversification of countries of origin, though the highest number of single country encounters this fiscal year came from Mexico. The data also demonstrates the Biden administration’s continued reliance on Title 42 to manage migration at the border, with the number of Title 42 expulsions nearly double that of Title 8 apprehensions. Though much of the news coverage focused on this year’s record high numbers, immigration researchers and journalists have also taken a more nuanced approach to the numbers, pointing out the complex nature of current migration trends at the U.S.-Mexico border. Focusing on the effect of recidivism, researchers underscore that reported apprehensions represent events, not individuals, and note that the recidivism rate from May to September 2021 (the only months in which those rates were officially reported) ranged from 25-38%. CBP’s September 2021 press release also underscored the high rate of repeated crossings, noting that “the large number of expulsions during the pandemic has contributed to a larger-than-usual number of migrants making multiple border crossing attempts, which means that total encounters somewhat overstate the number of unique individuals arriving at the border.” According to CBP, the rate of recidivism overall in FY2021 was 27%, up 1 percentage point from 26% in FY2020, meaning that the number of unique individuals encountered this fiscal year is likely closer to 1.2 million. From FY2015 to FY2019, recidivism rates dropped steadily, as seen in Figure 2, from 14% in FY2015 to 7% in FY2019, meaning that the 27% rate in repeat encounters this year is almost four times that of just two years ago. The fact that recidivism rates rose in FY2020 and FY2021 makes this a continuing trend, likely driven by the lack of significant consequence or opportunity costs for repeated crossings under Title 42, which repatriates migrants to Mexico within a short period of time, permitting additional attempts. The high recidivism rate this fiscal year also contributed to the overall higher number of encounters this year, as well as other trends outlined in this blog, such as the increase in encounters with Mexicans, the increase in single adults more generally, and the large numbers of expulsions under Title 42. This year, the highest number of encounters from a single country came from Mexico: more than 608,000. The number of Mexicans encountered at the border had generally trended downward from FY2010 to FY2019, as shown by Figure 3. There was an increase from FY2019 to&hellip;",

    "content": "Despite decades of progress made improving conditions for women in the workforce, there is still no federal law guaranteeing pregnant employees the right to reasonable workplace accommodations. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) would provide that guarantee, and it is now closer than it has ever been to becoming law. For the first time, approval by the Senate is all that stands between the PWFA—which has been introduced in every Congress since 2011 (and has garnered bipartisan support since 2015)—and the president’s desk. The COVID-19 pandemic drastically accelerated a two-decade decline in women’s labor force participation. The PWFA represents a straightforward, low-cost tool that would counter this trend and support women in the workforce. Currently, pregnant workers in much of the U.S. are not guaranteed even basic workplace accommodations such as the ability to sit rather than stand while working, drink water throughout the workday, or take additional bathroom breaks. While the Americans with Disabilities Act assures accommodations to workers with pregnancy-related disabilities, pregnancy itself does not qualify a worker for those protections. A 2015 Supreme Court decision extended the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, which outlaws workplace discrimination against women based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, to require employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers. However, under that decision, pregnant workers are only guaranteed accommodations if they can prove their employer provides similar accommodations to non-pregnant workers. Moreover, the 2015 ruling has been applied inconsistently, and a 2019 review of pregnancy accommodation cases found that “over two-thirds of courts held employers were not obligated to accommodate pregnant workers under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.” Not surprisingly, despite declining female labor force participation, federal pregnancy discrimination lawsuits have been on the rise since at least 2016. The PWFA would require companies with at least 15 employees to provide reasonable workplace accommodations to those affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. It would prohibit employers from requiring employees to take leave if an alternative accommodation is possible, denying employment opportunities based on an employee’s or job candidate’s need for reasonable accommodations, or retaliating against employees requesting or using such accommodations. The bill would also require an employer to develop the accommodations collaboratively with the employee. Reasonable accommodations can support a healthy pregnancy, a steady income, and employment after giving birth. These benefits accrue to both employee and employer, with a significant majority of employers providing accommodations reporting higher retention and employee productivity. Moreover, the current legal inconsistency poses a significant challenge to employers who simply want clear guidance on how to meet their employees’ needs while abiding by laws at all levels of government. Currently, around half the states in the country guarantee pregnant workers the right to workplace accommodations. In addition to leaving behind workers who don’t live or work in those states, the resulting patchwork of rules and regulations can be difficult for employers to navigate—particularly those that operate in multiple states. The PWFA would guarantee most pregnant workers the accommodations they need and resolve these&hellip;",

    "content": "Nearly one out of five federal student loan borrowers were in default before the Department of Education suspended interest and loan payments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This high prevalence of default, along with overall declines in repayment rates, demonstrate that borrowers are struggling to pay back their student loans. With monthly payments set to resume at the beginning of next year, a repayment crisis may be on the horizon. Although calls for mass forgiveness have dominated headlines, most student loans are already eligible for eventual forgiveness via income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. IDR plans limit a borrower’s monthly loan payment to a portion of their discretionary income, with the goal of ensuring these payments are affordable. For those with low or no income, payments can be as low as $0. Additionally, IDR plans forgive a borrower’s unpaid outstanding loan balance after 20 or 25 years in repayment, providing borrowers with eventual relief if their income is too low to repay their student debt in full. The number of federal student loan borrowers enrolled in IDR plans has almost tripled since 2013. These plans have proven effective at helping borrowers avoid default, an outcome that harms their ability to borrow to attend school, buy a house or car, or even utilize a credit card in the future. Borrowers who enroll in an income-driven plan within a year of entering repayment are about half as likely to default as borrowers in fixed-payment plans. Despite the benefits of IDR plans for struggling borrowers, however, the individuals most in need are often unaware of these plans or face confusion and red tape when trying to enroll. Additionally, although these plans offer necessary relief for many, their current structure disproportionately subsidizes borrowers with the highest outstanding loan balances, particularly those who pursued graduate degrees. These characteristics are strongly correlated with the borrowers who have the highest career earnings. Reforms to IDR could therefore better support struggling borrowers and prevent those with the highest incomes from receiving a windfall. Specifically, BPC recommends three reforms: Automatically enroll borrowers in a simplified IDR plan Eliminate the standard repayment cap Use a progressive payment formula for the new simplified IDR plan Automatic Enrollment in a Simplified IDR Plan Currently, borrowers hoping to enroll in an IDR plan must choose from four different plans, all with different monthly payment formulas and eligibility requirements. To remain enrolled, borrowers must also reapply annually by submitting their tax information. This confusing and onerous process prevents many borrowers—especially borrowers of color—from accessing the relief intended under IDR: non-white students are 7% more likely to remain in costly loan forbearance—where students temporarily forgo making loan payments but interest continues to accrue and capitalize, leading to higher total lifelong payments—instead of switching to an IDR plan. To eliminate IDR enrollment barriers and promote more equitable access to relief, all federal student loan borrowers entering repayment should be automatically enrolled into a single, streamlined IDR plan. Under this system, the Department of Education would notify borrowers&hellip;",

    "content": "Last year marked one of the worst wildfire seasons in United States history. More than 10 million acres burned across the country, forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans from their homes and costing the nation $16.5 billion in damages. Climate change contributed to a historically dry period for the Southwest U.S. in recent decades, making devastating wildfire seasons longer and more frequent. Since 2000, wildfires have burned an average of 7 million acres per year, more than double the average annual acres burned in the 1990s. Images of burnt orange skies spanning the Western U.S. are increasingly commonplace, and the costs of catastrophic yearly wildfires are becoming unbearable. While the impact of wildfires is mostly visible—burnt forests and communities, unhealthy air, and mass evacuations—they also have a less obvious effect: carbon dioxide emissions.1 Wildfires and the emissions they release are a natural part of the disturbance regimes of many western forests, aiding in the regeneration of tree species, which in turn sequester more carbon. However, the complex cycle of ecosystem restoration from wildfires is thrown out of balance with catastrophic fire events. Severe burns impact tree survival rates and impede future growth by negatively affecting the soil. The 2020 California wildfires were some of the most catastrophic wildfire events in America’s recent history, releasing 112 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent emissions of 24.2 million cars on the road for a year. While the emissions released by wildfires is a drop in the bucket compared the 6,558 million metric tons of carbon dioxide released nationally in 2019, catastrophic wildfire events contribute to a feedback loop where drier conditions created by climate change further prolong wildfire seasons, increasing the prevalence of wildfires, and therefore increasing carbon emissions. Proper wildfire management is critical to reduce risks for American communities and protect fragile ecosystems. Fire requires fuel to burn, and in the case of wildfires, trees, leaves, and vegetation are the fuel. Accumulated vegetation cause fires to burn faster, at higher temperatures, and with greater intensity, increasing the risk to communities, structures, and valuable infrastructure. Federal land management agencies along with state and local partners use fuel reduction projects to prevent wildfires from becoming more devastating by thinning vegetation and using prescribed burns. Prescribed burns are considered by many to be &#8220;good fires&#8221; since they are intentional, low-intensity fires that burn vegetation, reducing the amount of fuel available and mitigating the possibility of a larger, disastrous wildfire event. However, these wildfire management techniques are not being deployed on a wide enough scale. In fiscal year 2018, five federal land management agencies identified more than 100 million acres under their management at high risk from wildfires, yet they only treated approximately 3 million acres, leaving a sizable gap between the deployment of wildfire mitigation techniques and the high-risk acres in need of treatment. Wildfires frequently cross jurisdictional boundaries, requiring strong collaboration among federal and nonfederal stakeholders on both wildfire prevention and wildfire management. At the federal level, five agencies are responsible&hellip;",

    "content": "The youth mental health crisis is dire, necessitating a hard look at primary and behavioral health care integration as a solution. To be sure, nearly one in five children currently suffer from a mental health condition, yet only 20% of them receive care from a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other specialist. This unmet need was apparent before the pandemic and only worsened over the last year and a half. Notably, mental health-related emergency department visits among adolescents aged 12-17 grew 31% from 2019 to 2020. Due to the rising rates, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children’s Hospital Association, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) declared the mental health crisis among children a national emergency in October. Despite the need for care, children often face long wait times for appointments, which is sadly to be expected considering the shortage of mental health providers. The number of providers per 100,000 children is around 10, four times less than the number needed to meet demand, according to AACAP. Medicaid, which covers 27 million children under the age of 18, is an ideal platform to reach a significant number of children. Nearly a quarter of kids on Medicaid (6.4 million) have an identified behavioral health condition; however, it is likely that this number is much higher due to behavioral health issues that go untreated and undiagnosed. Among Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries under the age of 18, the number of children receiving mental health services dropped by 50% from February to October 2020. Integration is a particularly promising approach to improving care for children. In integrated settings, primary care and behavioral health providers work together to ensure the care of the entire individual. Children rely heavily on primary care for their health needs, and so it is practical to meet children where they are: their pediatrician&#8217;s office. Early detection is important. Without it, mental health conditions can become more severe, causing problems at home and school, and making it more difficult to form relationships. Because Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) cover such a large fraction of children enrolled in Medicaid (75%), they are well positioned to play an important role in integration and in improving care for children. The existing payment structure in MCOs makes them an ideal home for integration. Moreover, MCOs already have well-defined quality metrics, delivery standards, and payment methodologies through which integration can be applied, enforced, and incentivized. Key members of Congress have signaled that they are drafting policy solutions for consideration in 2022. The Senate Finance Committee requested input from stakeholders in September to better understand how Congress can address the growing need for mental health and substance use care, including improving access to behavioral health care for children and young people, and increasing integration. BPC&#8217;s Behavioral Health Integration Task Force released a report in March 2021 with recommendations that can make a difference for kids. The recommendations would provide pediatricians and other primary care providers with the necessary incentives and support&hellip;",

    "content": "Health and housing are inextricably linked. Quality, affordable housing isn’t simply about shelter, it is also about the sense of community, opportunity, and security that comes with having a safe, stable place to live. Without access to such a home, achieving an optimal quality of life becomes impossible, making housing one of the leading social determinants of health. As defined by the World Health Organization, social determinants of health are those “conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, which are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels.” Research suggests that in certain instances, affordable housing has contributed to a 12% reduction in the overall healthcare expenditures of Medicaid recipients, an 18% decrease in emergency department visits, and a 20% increase in use of primary care services.1 Investing in affordable housing has also been shown to have a significant and beneficial impact on the local economy. Access to stable housing can have a powerful impact on health outcomes, and that impact only becomes more significant when that housing is safe, well-maintained, and located in a dynamic neighborhood. Health disparities associated with conditions in residential communities are often caused by a lack of consistent investment within and across neighborhoods. For example, environmental conditions such as mold, poor ventilation, and pests have been linked to poor health, with an especially strong association with high asthma rates.2 At a neighborhood level, safe street infrastructure, walkability, and access to affordable fruits and vegetables, parks, and public transportation are some of the ways the built environment is tied to health.3 any of these elements are not consistent across communities, with low-wealth areas experiencing less favorable conditions.4 Improving the quality of affordable housing is one step toward supporting healthy communities and promoting a country in which everyone can attain the highest level of health possible—a condition commonly referred to as health equity. Since its founding in 2012, the Center for Active Design (CfAD) has focused on developing practical, implementable design strategies that promote health and create equitable access to public and private spaces. This mission has expanded to explore how design and development practice can affect the civic health of communities by inspiring greater trust, participation, and stewardship.5 CfAD’s strategy for incentivizing inclusive, equitable mixed-income communities that are designed for health has two core components: (1) working with actors across the real estate industry to implement the Fitwel® Certification System as a framework for optimizing health within commercial and residential buildings and sites, and (2) a partnership with Fannie Mae to advance the Healthy Housing Rewards™ (HHR) financial incentive program. The two strands of work complement each other because certification systems like Fitwel provide the evidence-based foundation and guidance necessary for developers, building managers, and building owners to design housing that supports, rather than detracts from, resident health. However, certification systems tend to primarily reach market-rate properties, as the desirable features can be used to garner rental premiums.

    "content": "The CDC recently announced that the U.S. surpassed 100,000 overdose deaths—the highest ever recorded in a year, from April 2020 to April 2021. This record-setting number follows the previously-reported figure of 93,145 overdose deaths for 2020—including 69,586 from opioids—indicating that mortality continued to rise well into 2021. The opioid epidemic began in the late 1990s and was recently exacerbated by the emergence of deadly fentanyl. Increased fentanyl use, accompanied by the long-standing stigma towards addiction and the COVID-19 pandemic, intensified the conditions leading to overdose. People with substance abuse disorders were greatly affected by the pandemic’s disruption of daily life, forced stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and limited access to treatment services. Reaching the grim milestone of 100,000 overdose deaths in a 12-month period reminds us that the opioid epidemic, alongside the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergencies, necessitates a more coordinated federal response. BPC’s 2019 and 2020 reports both note significant investments in federal spending to address the opioid addiction and overdose epidemic. Despite these investments, overdose mortality rates continue to rise, driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and an increased prevalence of methamphetamine and cocaine involved in overdose deaths. Overdose mortality rates have been increasing across all regions of the country. Between April 2020 and April 2021, overdose mortality rates have continued to increase in both the Northeast (10% over 12 months and 18% since January 2019) and the Midwest (22% over 12 months and 37% since January 2019). Even more noteworthy is the stark percentage increase in overdose mortality rates in the West (39% over 12 months and 67% since January 2019) and the South (36% over 12 months and 57% since January 2019) compared with the same period a year earlier. These faster percentage increases in drug overdose mortality rates in the West and South are supported by data that also indicate an increase in the use of fentanyl in these regions. Moreover, the South has surpassed the Northeast as the region with the highest drug overdose mortality rate. Even the worst regional mortality rate a year ago is lower than the best regional mortality rate a year later. In April 2020, the highest regional mortality rate—27.2 per 100,000 in the Northeast—was exceeded by the lowest regional mortality rate in April 2021—27.3 per 100,000 in the West. The increase in drug overdose mortality in 2020 was not uniform across demographic groups: Black and Hispanic mortality rates increased by over 40%, compared to a 24% increase for whites. Differences in mortality by sex were roughly the same by quarter between 2019-2020: 30% of overdose deaths were female and 67%-70% of overdose deaths were male. In the past year, Congress responded to the worsening overdose mortality rates by appropriating billions of dollars to opioid-related programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Bill—also known as the COVID-19 Relief Bill — included $350 million for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to expand Certified Behavioral Health Clinics and provide mental health and substance use disorder emergency grants.

However, employed adults are equally comfortable sharing their views in the workplace as they are on social media. While a large majority of adults say colleges should be thinking core skills: independent thinking, ability to work with a diverse workforce, discuss disagreements, only half of adults say colleges are successfully teaching these skills. Democrats are more likely than independents and Republicans to say colleges and universities are teaching the listed skills to students well. A minority (45%) of adults say colleges and universities are doing excellent or well at teaching the ability to converse with people they disagree with to students. Current college students are more likely than adults overall to agree colleges should restrict words and language deemed harmful. Current undergraduate students are more likely than adults overall to say colleges and universities should be able to restrict words and language they deem harmful to students (80%) and that some ideas are hateful and should not be discussed on a college campus (66%). Survey Objectives The research conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the Bipartisan Policy Center seeks to understand the following research objectives: Overall confidence, trust, and perceived value of higher education institutions in comparison to other institutions Comfort level adults have in expressing different types of views in different settings Value adults place on free expression and academic freedom and the role of higher education including importance of colleges preparing students to have conversations with people who are different from them Methodology This poll was conducted between November 16-19, 2021 among a sample of 2,199 adults.

    "content": "The holidays are a time to reflect and acknowledge the contributions of Native Americans. Sadly, despite the contributions Native Americans have made to the U.S., they frequently do not fully benefit from federal programs, including early care and education programs. Although there are multiple funding streams available for tribal early care and education, these programs are frequently underfunded. There is a clear need to invest in and expand early care and education programs that serve Native American children and families. According to a forthcoming BPC survey of Native American parents, among Native American parents who say at least one member of their household is not currently working, 77 percent said child care responsibilities had an influence on their decision not to work, including 64 percent who say it had a significant influence. Among Native American parents using a formal child care arrangement, 55 percent say their child care provider is experiencing employee shortages. Federal law often sets funding levels for federally recognized tribes as a percentage of the total authorization without determining funding based on tribal population counts or actual need. HHS, for example, must allocate tribal grantees no less than 2% of discretionary CCDF funding and up to 2% of mandatory CCDF funding, meaning tribes may have more children than they were funded to serve. Tribal Home Visiting (THV), which improves prenatal care and reduces child injuries, abuse, neglect, and emergency room visits for tribal grantees, is another underfunded federal program. The law sets aside 3% of the annual funding for tribes, meaning that only a small number of tribes can be served despite the benefits. In FY2019, while all 50 states received funding for home visiting, only 23 of the 574 federally recognized tribes, or 4 percent, were served by THV. This amounts to 4,177 of the 339,400 (1.23 percent) of Native American families who could have benefitted from this program. The programs that do ground funding in tribal count data, such as IDEA Part B Grants to States and IDEA Part C Early intervention, leave out the 78 percent of Native Americans who live outside of tribal statistical areas. Tribal count data only counts those living on reservations or other tribal land trusts, making it more difficult for the majority of Native Americans living off tribal lands to access services. In addition to insufficient funding, there continues to be a lack of systematic data collection both on tribal populations and on tribal programs. This not only results in a shortage of consistent data on Native American children and families but makes it harder to evaluate the effectiveness of tribal programs. Looking at existing data points reveals stark inequities: In addition, Native American children are more likely to face harsh disciplinary practices in schools. Native American children make up less than 1 percent of the preschool population but 9 percent of corporal punishment incidents. In California, Native American boys are 2.5 times more likely and Native American girls are 3.7 times more likely to be suspended in early childhood settings than their same-aged, same-gender peers. In terms&hellip;",

    "content": "Higher education financing has faced monumental challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic disruption. State budgets experienced a $22 billion shortfall last year, and higher education funding often ended up on the chopping block. At the same time, postsecondary enrollment declined by almost 3% and institutions faced increased pandemic costs. As policymakers confront these challenges, there is an opportunity to prepare for future periodic recessions. Only a solution that proactively addresses this reality can ensure consistent funding, through thick and thin, for the higher education system and the students it serves. The story of state higher education finance over the past few decades is ripe with déjà vu. As states have struggled to maintain consistent per-student resources, institutions have become more reliant on tuition revenue. This dynamic drives up tuition prices and contributes to a lack of affordability for students. Recessions punctuate this pattern and heighten these funding challenges. Because states have balanced budget requirements, when a recession hits, they pull back on their spending, and postsecondary education is often among the early cuts. Institutions have historically relied on the increase in enrollment that typically occurs during a recession to generate additional tuition revenue to smooth funding gaps. But this stopgap is not guaranteed: Enrollment actually declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the past few recessions, the federal government stepped in to provide emergency support for postsecondary institutions. Following the Great Recession, higher education received $10 billion in relief, just a fraction of the $54 billion allocated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers rightly acted to support a system in crisis, but these pricey Band-Aids are not a sustainable solution. They leave the system—and students—susceptible to the political winds. Moreover, this emergency spending is difficult to calibrate in the moment. Only a long-term strategy to support consistent state investment in higher education can break the cycle of recessionary cuts and expensive emergency spending. BPC’s Task Force on Higher Education Financing and Student Outcomes proposed creating a rainy day fund to mitigate this issue. States participating in a new federal matching grant program would have a portion of their matching funds set aside to be drawn upon in the event of a recession. This would both relieve pressure on state budgets during recessions and ensure states continue to qualify for additional matching funds. This is one approach, but there are other proposals that achieve similar aims. For example, The Institute for College Access &#038; Success recommends providing states that maintain funding during recessions with a more generous federal match. Likewise, the America’s College Promise Act and the House-passed Build Back Better legislation would decrease the required match for states during recessions while maintaining federal funding. Establishing a new financing relationship between states and the federal government would allow for meaningful investments to improve college affordability. Recessions—and their impact on state higher education budgets—are a predictable reality, and policymakers should account for them in any effort to provide students with more affordable college prices. A countercyclical mechanism would break&hellip;",

    "content": "Federal student loan debt has exploded since the Great Recession. As students are borrowing more to finance their education, they are also struggling to repay their loans with nearly one in every five borrowers in default prior to the COVID-19 pandemic’s payment freeze. In addition to financially straining many borrowers, the growing federal student loan portfolio places a burden on the federal budget and poses a risk to taxpayers. BPC’s recent report, Student Debt and the Federal Budget: How Student Loans Impact the U.S. Fiscal Outlook, explores the origins and budgetary impact of rising debt levels and offers policy options to rein in this growth while promoting better borrower outcomes.   Prior to 2010, federal student loans were issued by private lenders and guaranteed by the federal government. During the Great Recession, however, a spike in higher education enrollment and applications for federal student aid coincided with fears that dried up credit markets would inhibit access to federal student loans. In response, policymakers enacted legislation to originate all new loans through the federal government using federal funds. Although the switch to direct lending was expected to produce savings, it is unclear if these benefits materialized; regardless, the government and taxpayers now bear the full burden when borrowers cannot repay their student loans.   Meanwhile, between 2007 and 2015, federal student loan debt more than doubled in real terms, growing much faster than the economy. Since this initial accumulation, the student loan portfolio has continued to grow—reaching $1.6 trillion in 2021—though at a slower rate due to the declining annual volume of loans issued. As total debt levels continue to rise, the task of curbing this growth is complicated by lackluster repayment outcomes and high default rates.  Repayment rates have fallen in recent years: A growing share of federal borrowers are unable to reduce their principal loan balance by at least one dollar within three years of graduating. This trend, while concerning, may be partially explained by increased borrower enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. IDR plans allow borrowers to limit monthly payment amounts to a share of their discretionary income, and, after a certain number of payments (usually 20 or 25 years’ worth), any outstanding loan balance is forgiven. These plans help ensure affordable monthly payments for borrowers who enroll: Among borrowers who entered repayment between fiscal years 2010 and 2014, those enrolled in an IDR plan were 28 times less likely to default than those on a standard repayment plan.   Still, prior to the pandemic, an increasing proportion of borrowers were in default. The ongoing growth of outstanding student loan debt is troubling, not only for vulnerable borrowers, but also for taxpayers who could be left to foot the growing bill if policymakers fail to address these trends.   Over the past 15 years, college has become more expensive for students, with the average real cost of tuition, fees, room, and board minus grant aid (net TFRB) at public four-year colleges and universities increasing by 18% since the 2006-07 academic year. The cost of a public education has risen following a trend of states cutting funding for higher education during recessions. To compensate for losses in state funding, schools raise tuition prices, in turn leading students to borrow more to finance their education. These state funding cuts, along with uncapped Grad and Parent PLUS lending and evidence that easy access to federal student loan funds has diminished consumer sensitivity to tuition increases, create the potential for a vicious cycle of rising tuition and higher debt loads for students.  As students take on higher debt loads, less is being paid back. Loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and the capping of monthly payments under some IDR plans make the student loan portfolio particularly costly to taxpayers. The problem is further complicated by a lack of accountability for postsecondary institutions. The current higher education oversight system fails to identify institutions and programs that leave students with massive debt without providing sufficient earnings gains or a return on their investment to repay it.  Together, growing out-of-pocket costs, unrestrained PLUS Loan borrowing, generous repayment and forgiveness programs, and a lack of institutional accountability continue to drive up the cost of student debt for the federal government.  To address these problems, policymakers should explore options that mitigate taxpayers’ risk exposure to student debt, provide relief to struggling borrowers, and reduce reliance on the federal student loan system. This could include&hellip;",

Unfortunately a piece of data from that report has been cited incorrectly, and the erroneous data has been picked up and this mischaracterization shared. Through our national survey, we found that 31% of working-parent households used center-based care. Out of that 31%, we found that 53% of those families used a faith-based child care center.

Concerns included the proposal’s requirement for approval to protest in a central area of campus and limits to the use of amplified sound. A university spokesman said that the proposed changes were meant to clarify existing policies rather than to limit expressive activities.

While rural living has its benefits – a slower pace, deep community ties, rich agriculture – it is not without its challenges, especially when it comes to health care. According to the CDC, those living in rural America are “more likely to die from heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke.” And yet, access to care in rural areas is dwindling: Since 2005, 181 rural hospitals have closed across the U.S., leaving some with reduced access to health care services and others without in-patient care nearby. While the situation may seem dim, recent telehealth flexibilities – especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic – have benefitted rural communities, minimizing the need to travel for services or take time off for care. While rural populations are shrinking and the need for inpatient hospital beds declines, the need for access to care remains. Recognizing this, Congress created the Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) program last December. Under the program, communities would be allowed to transform inpatient hospitals into emergency and outpatient care facilities. REHs would also receive a “facility payment” for spending toward extra medical and support services including behavioral health, oral health care services and other patient support. Regulators are working to flesh out details of the program. BPC looks forward to helping inform the development of this critical new rural hospital model into the coming months. The problems facing rural America’s access to healthcare are getting noticed: Several Sens. recently wrote a letter to HHS and HRSA urging them to make sure that funds allocated for rural health providers under the American Rescue Plan Act are, in fact, given to rural providers. There are two pieces of legislation being considered in Congress: S.1512, the Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies (CONNECT) for Health Act of 2021 and H.R.708, the Temporary Reciprocity to Ensure Access to Treatment (TREAT) Act. In South Dakota, leaders from Avera and Sanford Health, two of the state health systems, met to discuss the growing rural health care needs. In Kentucky, the Pikeville Medical Center received a nearly $100,00 grant to “improve health and mental outcomes” of children living in rural Kentucky as part of the HRSA Rural Health Network Development Planning Program The University of Alabama at Birmingham was recently awarded up to $5 million in grant funds through the CMS Innovation Center’s Community Health Access and Rural Transformation (CHART) Model, another rural hospital transformation model to help address access to quality care in rural areas.

Although the IIJA did not make leveraging private capital a focus, the legislation has the potential to be the catalyst for a significant increase in public-private partnerships or P3s. Despite their benefits, P3s remain relatively rare in the United States compared to the rest of the world. Although there is no single data source for tracking P3s, studies have generally found that P3s represent only about 1-2% of infrastructure spending in the U.S., whereas they make up 5-20% of infrastructure spending in other developed countries. The drafters of the IIJA may not have explicitly set out to grow the U.S. market for P3s, but there are five reasons to expect that the bill could do just that. While these provisions of the IIJA will make P3s easier to accomplish, there is more work to do to ensure that P3s reach their full potential. Public agencies need to develop asset inventories so that they have a comprehensive picture of their infrastructure conditions and needs. Private companies must develop effective strategies for working with affected employees and labor unions. On-going oversight and education are needed to overcome public concerns about the role of the private sector in public infrastructure. Coupled with the key elements of the IIJA, these steps would make the U.S. more conducive to P3s, bringing additional private sector expertise and capital to bear in tackling America’s infrastructure challenges.",

    "content": "Tomorrow, the House Small Business Committee will hear from Isabel Guzman, Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA). After nearly 20 months during which crisis response consumed the agency, the SBA has entered a new forward-looking phase. It is extracting lessons learned from the COVID-19 experience and trying to determine how the agency can adapt to a shifting landscape. The hearing is a chance for members of Congress to focus on those lessons and how the SBA plans to apply them to existing programs and new initiatives. It is also an opportunity for the Small Business Committee to understand what changes the SBA is making—and will make—to address deep-seated challenges exposed by the COVID crisis. 1. What changes is SBA making—and what changes does SBA need congressional support for—to manage its higher profile and expectations? In any given year, prior to COVID-19, the SBA interacted with less than 10 percent of small employer businesses. During the pandemic, the agency touched nearly all small businesses, both employer and nonemployer. This has created a larger public profile for the agency as well as greater public expectations. There will likely be stronger demand for SBA products, programs, and services as well as more questions asked by stakeholders about the agency’s performance. 2. What additional controls is SBA putting in place to manage and limit fraud? Inspector General reports have found billions of dollars in fraudulent and misspent loan funds. The sheer volume of pandemic relief overwhelmed existing systems. The agency has been working closely with the Department of Justice and others to investigate specific cases. Yet clearly additional changes will be needed to limit fraud in the future. 3. What efforts are being made by SBA—and what assistance can Congress provide—to scale the capabilities of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program? That program was not built to respond to a nationwide pandemic, yet the COVID-19 crisis made clear that technology modernization is needed to enhance deployment of EIDL relief. There will be future emergencies—hopefully none on the scale of the pandemic—and this experience has taught that scaling EIDL should be an agency priority. 4. Would traditional lenders, in the existing delegated system, make more small-dollar loans if they were able to charge a slightly higher rate or fee? We know there is considerable demand for small loans, particularly those under $150,000. Yet the average size of an SBA-backed loan has steadily risen as traditional lenders have shied away from making such loans because of their high cost. Some lenders have said that if they were allowed to charge a higher rate—say, two more percentage points—they could make these loans. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, online lenders played an important role in distributing PPP loans and reaching borrowers not reached by traditional lenders. The possibility of including these lenders in existing SBA loan guarantee programs could help close the small-dollar gap. 5. What changes need to be made—either by SBA or Congress—to manage the economics of smaller loans as direct lending by government potentially&hellip;",

    "content": "Climate migration is an issue that is raised more and more often in international and domestic areas, drawing attention from both the Biden administration and the United Nations, among others. Despite the increased attention on the topic, there is still little agreement on a universal definition for the term, who falls under the definition “climate migrant,” or even the use of the term itself.  There are multiple phrases that have been proposed for a person who is forced to move due to environmental or climate factors. Climate-displaced person, environmental migrant, climate refugee, climate migrant, and environmentally-displaced person are some of the terms in use in research, articles and governmental documents. Part of the difficulty of agreeing on a widely used definition of climate migrant is likely because it is difficult to determine any one causal factor for migration. Migration is almost always multi-causal, and it is hard to point to any one factor as the deciding factor. Disentangling people’s reasoning for leaving their country is difficult, as their reasons will often prove to be complex and multi-layered, and migrant surveys tend not to reflect this nuance. In addition, climate impacts are being felt in different ways around the world, meaning that people’s reasons for migrating that are related to climate changes are also different. Overall, the phenomenon is highly complex, and agreeing on a definition has proved challenging.  Each potential nomenclature comes with its own pros and cons. The term “climate refugee” is not particularly popular with international organizations, lawmakers, or the migrants themselves, with most arguing that the term is inaccurate. Legally, people displaced by climate change are not refugees, since they do not qualify for refugee protection under the terms of the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol, which provides protection for those having a “well-founded fear of persecution” in their own countries. Those who are displaced by climate change also dislike the term, claiming that it can be stigmatizing, strips them of their humanity, and often does not accurately reflect their circumstances.  Dina Ionesco, the head of the Migration, Environment, and Climate Change Division at the U.N.’s migration agency (IOM) wrote an op-ed pointing out that the term “climate refugee” overlooks key aspects of human mobility. She highlights that most climate migration is internal, that migration is not always forced (especially in the context of slow-onset climate processes), and that isolating environmental reasons for migrating from humanitarian, political, social conflict, or economic reasons is difficult. She fears that creating a category for climate refugees might exclude people who move for a mix of reasons, and that opening the 1951 Convention for debate might weaken refugee status overall. Finally, she emphasizes that existing bodies of law, preventive strategies, and migration management strategies should be utilized. Many migration experts agree with her qualms regarding the term, asserting that migration should not be framed as a single-cause issue and arguing that migration is always multi-causal, with climate change acting as a threat multiplier that exacerbates existing issues in people’s home countries.  “Climate migrant” also comes with negative implications for the opposite reason, as the word “migrant” may suggest “a degree of volition in the decision to move,” which does not accurately reflect that many displaced by climate feel as if they have no choice but to move. However, the term is more accurate than “climate refugee” under existing legal frameworks and is more inclusive of internally displaced migrants. The term “environmental migrant” still incorporates the term “migrant,” but it includes internally displaced persons and avoids the legally tricky territory of “climate refugee.” Some argue the term is even more inclusive than “climate migrant” because it comprises people&hellip;",

    "content": "Last year there was a slight uptick—a less than 1% increase—in the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness. The increase comes after years of mostly steady decreases, with strong advocacy, intergovernmental coordination and priority setting, and steady funding for evidence-based programs halving Veteran’s homelessness since 2009 when HUD first reported this data. While Veterans represented 23% of the entire homeless population in the United States in 1996, that number was just 8% in 2020. However, there is much more work to be done to house Veterans and we don’t yet know what role the pandemic will play in rates of Veteran homelessness. According to HUD, there were more than 37,000 Veterans experiencing homelessness in the United States on a single night in 2020. Source:  https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2020-AHAR-Part-1.pdf   Based on available data and research, homeless Veterans share certain attributes—they tend to be younger, “enlisted with lower pay grades,” and more likely “to be diagnosed with mental disorders or traumatic brain injury” when compared to Veterans with housing. In fact, more than 50% of homeless Veterans have experienced some form of mental illness, including substance use disorders, or suffered from a traumatic brain injury. Sources: https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-11-03428-173.pdf , https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2020-AHAR-Part-1.pdf  &nbsp; Veterans represent a unique subgroup of the entire homeless population and, as such, may be eligible for different federal programs and benefits. There is a lot of data and research on Veterans’ homelessness, and years of testing and expanding housing and service programs provide valuable lessons for addressing broader challenges with homelessness. HUD and the VA have pursued a “Housing First” approach to help Veterans “obtain stable housing as quickly as possible without barriers or preconditions.” Of primary importance is placing homeless individuals in permanent housing regardless of their intent to participate in treatment, education, job training, and more. While these wraparound services are often offered, the foremost concern is housing. A number of federally operated programs target the needs of homeless Veterans, specifically, the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) and the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program: The SSVF program rapidly re-houses Veterans with very low incomes who are homeless or on the verge of losing their housing. Federal grants are provided to non-profit organizations which in turn provide wraparound services, including case management and temporary financial support, until housing stability is achieved. The HUD-VASH program provides rental housing vouchers and wraparound services to homeless Veterans. Since 2008, Congress has allocated funding to local public housing authorities through the HUD-VASH program based on geographic need and PHA performance. HUD-VASH “enrolls the largest number and largest percentage of Veterans who have experienced long-term or repeated homelessness,” providing assistance to more than 90,000 Veterans in 2019. Sources: https://www.va.gov/homeless/nchav/models/ssvf.asp,  https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/vash, https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/  While the impacts of COVID-19 on those experiencing homelessness remain to be seen, there are other tangible impediments to securing adequate housing for homeless Veterans, including: Underutilization of HUD-VASH vouchers. According to data from HUDs Housing Choice Voucher Program Dashboard, of the 100,000+ HUD-VASH vouchers awarded, less than 80,000 are being utilized.

    "content": "Democratic leaders are currently working to include a paid family leave program into their Build Back Better legislation, the total size of which is being vigorously debated. Two ways to decrease the costs of paid leave include means-testing benefits (as requested by Senator Manchin) and limiting a national program to parental leave (as Speaker Pelosi has suggested). Combining these two elements – a means-tested paid parental leave benefit that is targeted to low-income workers – would provide benefits to the workers most in need of paid leave, while significantly limiting the cost of the program. Low- and middle-income workers are the least likely to receive any form of paid leave today. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), only 12% of workers in the bottom quartile of wages have paid family leave, compared to 35% of those in the top quartile and 40% of those in the top 10%. In the absence of a defined paid family leave benefit, workers commonly use other employer-provided benefits, such as short-term disability, vacation, and sick days. However, low-income workers often do not have access to these benefits either. For instance, only 20% of wage earners in the bottom quartile have short-term disability, compared to 56% of the top quartile of wage earners. As a result, only 33% of workers in low-income families are paid by their employer when they need to take family or medical leave, compared to 66% and 84% of those in middle- and high-income families, respectively. In a 2017 American Action Forum – American Enterprise Institute report, Angela Rachidi and I outlined an option for a means-tested paid parental leave program that would provide low-income workers the ability to take 12 weeks of paid time off to bond with a newborn or adopted child. Modeled after the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), our proposed program would base parental leave benefits and eligibility on household income relative to the federal poverty level (FPL). Benefits would replace up to 80% of weekly income and phase out at 325% of FPL ($76,700 in household income for a family of three). We also illustrated a more expansive option that would use a slower phase-out rate and be available for those below 450% of FPL ($98,600 for a family of three). The first option (under 325% of FPL) would reach roughly 40% of workers at a cost of about $4 billion per year while the second option (under 450% of FPL) would reach over half the workforce and cost about $6 billion annually. The substantial advantage of targeting low-income workers is that it would be highly cost-effective. This 12-week parental leave program would be considerably less costly than a comparable 12-week parental leave program with universal coverage, which would cost $13 to $17 billion each year.1 In addition, targeting low-income workers means that most benefits would go to those who currently lack paid leave from their employers. A universal program, on the other hand, would cover many workers who already have access to paid&hellip;",

    "content": "As large tech companies face increasing antitrust scrutiny, it is hard not to notice how digitization has permeated much of our lives. Shopping, professional networking, and matchmaking services are all activities that have become common on digital platforms and the internet. This blog is the second in a multi-part series on digital platforms. The first blog explained the platform business model, while this one will look at digitization and its effects, aiming to help readers understand how digitization has changed platform businesses and markets. Later blogs in this series will explore digitization further through the lens of competition and public policy. Digitization refers to the process of converting information into a machine-readable format and has allowed people and organizations to collect and store more granular data than ever before. Digitization enables technologies such as online streaming services and search engines. Over the past several decades, the cost of data storage has plummeted and the amount of data generated has grown rapidly. According to cloud storage company Backblaze, &#8220;hard drives prices have dropped from around $500,000 per gigabyte in 1981 to less than $0.03 per gigabyte .&#8221; The World Economic Forum projected the digital universe would reach 44 zettabytes in 2020 and stated, &#8220;If this number is correct, it will mean there are 40 times more bytes than there are stars in the observable universe.&#8221; Digitization has had considerable effects on society. Economists Avi Goldfarb and Catherine Tucker have identified lower search costs, lower replication costs, lower transportation costs, lower tracking costs, and lower verification costs as five major ways the economy has changed as a result of digitization. Lower search costs: Digitization has made it less costly to look for things. For instance, the internet makes it easier to find different products and services. Lower replication costs: Digitization has made the cost of replicating certain items incredibly cheap. For example, once developed, the marginal cost of producing additional copies of an app is virtually zero. Lower transportation costs: The cost of transporting digital goods is effectively zero in most cases. For instance, once the infrastructure is in place, sending email messages to people costs little more than the electricity needed to do so. Lower tracking costs: Digitization has made tracking people and items much cheaper. For instance, tracking a package purchased online as it makes its way from the warehouse to your front door. Lower verification costs: Digitization has made verifying things easier. For instance, a smartphone can use a person&#8217;s fingerprints to verify their identity quickly. These trends have many benefits but also raise policy challenges and concerns. For instance, lower tracking costs can help an app track users&#8217; activity to tailor its services, but it can also create privacy concerns for its users. They also have implications for platform businesses, which will be discussed in the next section. &#8220;Digital platforms&#8221; are the combination of the platform business model and digitization. Digitization has had two major impacts on platform businesses: Digitization has allowed platforms to grow quickly and&hellip;",

    "content": "Even before the pandemic, about one million households were evicted each year through the court system, with millions more being evicted without formal judicial proceedings. The pandemic—with the initial surge in job and income losses—led to widespread concern about a potential wave of evictions. A previous BPC blog explored congressional efforts to stave off an eviction crisis through Emergency Rental Assistance funding, which local programs have been slow to distribute even after the end of the federal eviction moratorium. As policymakers consider the future of eviction prevention and diversion efforts, we break down two pending proposals in Congress: the Eviction Crisis Act of 2021 and the Eviction Prevention Act of 2021. The Eviction Crisis Act, cosponsored by Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Todd Young (R-IN), would require HUD to establish a national eviction database and give grants to support landlord-tenant community courts and eviction diversion programs. Eviction mediation courts and diversion programs help struggling renters avoid more formal legal proceedings by offering landlords and tenants opportunities for negotiation and mediation, building partnerships between them and reducing evictions. The bill would also provide financial assistance and housing stabilization services to extremely low-income households. The Eviction Prevention Act would similarly establish a national eviction database, but it would also authorize a grant program at the U.S. Department of Justice to help states and localities provide access to legal counsel for tenants facing eviction. The Eviction Prevention Act has only Democratic support thus far and is sponsored by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT). When it comes to legal representation in eviction court, there is an imbalance: 90% of landlords have representation, while only 10% of tenants do. Proponents of the Eviction Prevention Act argue that tenants have a significantly better chance of staying in their homes if they have legal representation. For example, when San Francisco implemented a program to offer tenants legal aid, 67% of tenants with full representation were able to stay in their homes, compared to 38% of those with limited representation. The table below outlines key similarities and differences between the two bills. Preventing unnecessary evictions should be a national, bipartisan priority. Evictions can be devastating for a family’s economic prospects, leading to multiple unwanted moves or homelessness and difficulty securing housing for those with an eviction record. For many families and communities, eviction is a driver as much as a result of poverty, leading to the loss of employment and possessions. Evictions can adversely affect physical health, and are associated with higher levels of mental health issues such as depression and stress. Evictions also disproportionately harm Black renters, who have fallen further behind on rent during the pandemic. Congress should carefully consider the merits of these and other legislative proposals to prevent evictions, while weighing both the successes and challenges of emergency rental assistance programs, to advance bipartisan solutions that keep vulnerable families stably housed.

However, they differ over how long these entities have to report confirmed cyber incidents. Meanwhile, a more flexible version of the bill from the House, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2021 (H.R.5440), has been incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for the Fiscal Year 2022 (H.R.4350). In contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee’s bill, which requires entities to report cyber incidents within 24 hours, the House bill prohibits the CISA Director from requiring entities to report cyber incidents any earlier than 72 hours after confirmation.   Many of the large spending bills circulating through Congress also contain key provisions concerning cybersecurity and endow CISA with additional funding to pursue cybersecurity objectives. This includes the annual National Defense Authorization Act (H.R.4350); the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (H.R.3684); and the Reconciliation bill, or Build Back Better Act (H.R.5376). The following is a factual summary of each bill or relevant section within a bill without commentary on the alleged problem they seek to remedy or if they are the appropriate response.  Cyber Incident Reporting Bills as of 10/28/2021  Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2021 (H.R.5440)  Requires that CISA develop rules for critical infrastructure owners to report cyber incidents within 270 days of the bill’s enactment Establishes a Cyber Incident Review Office (CIRO) in CISA that would:  Receive, aggregate, and analyze reports related to cyber incidents submitted by a critical infrastructure operator (also referred to as a “covered entity”)  Share information related to cyber incidents with critical infrastructure operators as well as the intelligence community  Conduct reviews of the details surrounding reported cyber incidents to prevent them from happening in the future  Review reports for cyber threat indicators that can be anonymized and sent out to appropriate stakeholders  Publish quarterly reports with its findings and recommendations based on reported incidents  Optimize the quality of coordination and information sharing efforts  Provides a liability shield to covered entities that report cyber incidents to CIRO (per the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015)  Gives the CISA Director the authority to issue a civil subpoena to a covered entity that fails to respond to a request for information after seven days  Prohibits the CISA Director from requiring covered entities to report a cyber incident earlier than 72 hours of confirmation  Cyber Incident Reporting Act of 2021 (S.2875)  Requires that CISA develop rules for critical infrastructure owners to report cyber incidents within 270 days of the bill’s enactment  Establishes a CIRO within CISA with provisions largely modeled after those enumerated in H.R.5440  Ransomware provisions:  Requires covered entities to notify the federal government within 24 hours if they make a ransom payment,  Requires entities that plan on making a ransom payment to first&hellip;",

    "content": "In March, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan, which included an historic increase in funding for child care. It included $38 billion for child care. This is  ten times the amount of money provided in the 2020 December COVID-19 relief package and significantly more money than has ever been provided by the annual, federal appropriations process. For reference, that is roughly $5.8 billion, which, while greatly appreciated, has been challenging to maneuver for state child care administrators and state bureaucracies before ever reaching providers and families. The ARP included: $14 billion appropriated through the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and $23.97 billion appropriated through a new child care stabilization fund. Attached to this new funding was an added sense of urgency for states to quickly spend the stabilization money. There was a provision in the ARP requiring obligation of the money within the next two years and a requirement that states report to the Department of Health and Human Services by December 2021 whether they can spend 50% of their allotted stabilization funding. Considering the strains COVID-19 has placed on families &#8211; especially women &#8211; and the child care sector, it is understandable that Congress, providers, and advocates wanted to see the money allocated and spent quickly to get to the families who need it most as soon as possible. And while some state agencies can work expeditiously, others have been faced with legislative obstacles that make it difficult to authorize spending the money in a timely manner. According to 2021 data from the National Association of State Budget Officers, and displayed in the table below, 40 states can spend unanticipated funds without legislative approval, but 29i states report that there are limitations on this authority. For example, in Oregon, the executive branch is required to make a request to the legislative branch to increase any expenditure authority. In a previous 2015 report, 19 states reported needing legislative approval before spending any unanticipated funds, indicating more states have instituted these processes. Most recently, some states faced challenges in spending the $10 billion provided for child care in the December aid package. In Idaho, despite the state receiving $58 million in child care funding from the December relief deal, the state legislature only authorized the Governor to spend $24 million, or half of what the federal government gave the state, while the remaining funding was allocated as a state budget line item that couldn’t be spent until July 2021. These checks and balances at the state-level, while important for accountability, could further complicate the ability for executive agencies to spend the new ARP funding quickly. The full implications are still yet to be determined. As of October 18, only 25 states had posted their ARP plans explaining how they will use the federal funds. Of the 29 states with potential legislative restrictions, 15 have publicly posted how they will use their ARP stabilization funds. Because state child care administrators are in the midst of managing an unprecedented amount of money,&hellip;",

    "content": "“There’s a lot of enthusiasm on both sides of the aisle to lend a helping hand to small businesses.” &#8211; Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) As Congressman Foster highlighted during a recent BPC event, small businesses and entrepreneurs have historically enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was conceived by Democrats and Republicans together as a crisis response measure in the spring of 2020. Bipartisan bills are routinely introduced each session of Congress with the aim of helping small businesses and entrepreneurs. There is not always, however, agreement on the details of what small businesses and entrepreneurs need from government. The Small Business Act, the operative legislation for the Small Business Administration (SBA), has not been reauthorized in over two decades. The SBA has of course continued to fulfill its mission despite this. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it deployed roughly 40 years’ worth of traditional lending support in just 14 months. Republicans and Democrats do agree that the SBA showcased its strengths and abilities during the crisis—but also that the pandemic exposed areas where improvement and enhanced capabilities are needed. In response, the Bipartisan Policy Center launched a Task Force on the Future of SBA. The new effort was announced during the October 14th event at which Rep. Foster spoke. After brief remarks from the Task Force’s two co-chairs, Ann Marie Mehlum and Pradeep Belur, two other members of the Task Force discussed the why of the Task Force. Chris Ledesma and Chris Pilkerton discussed the opportunity they see at hand for bipartisan reforms that will double-down on SBA’s strengths and help provide it with new capabilities to meet evolving challenges. Both Pilkerton and Ledesma emphasized that the Task Force seeks input from as many corners as possible. Small businesses employ half of the private sector workforce, while new and young companies account for the lion’s share of net new job creation each year. Any policy agenda for small business and entrepreneurship—especially one with bipartisan support—must gather insight from a broad swath of the country. “This has got to be an all hands on deck effort, it’s critical for our country, it’s critical for the agency, but it’s critical for that person out there who’s thinking, ‘hey should I start a small business?’” &#8211; Chris Pilkerton, chief legal and regulatory strategy office, Accion Opportunity Fund “I would like to hear from others around what they think about where the SBA can go. … We need stakeholders, we need people in the communities and others with expertise in this area. It’s not necessarily all about the SBA, it’s about how we all interact with the agency and how we can all get better. We need all voices in the room to help us do that.” &#8211; Chris Ledesma, senior vice president of SBA lending, Wells Fargo",

Congressman Foster also pointed to the 2020-21 surge in new business formation as a hopeful sign for economic recovery. “It’s our economy getting off the couch and getting moving again. … A lot of people have been daydreaming about starting their own business, they had a lot of time on their hands during COVID lockdown. And they realize now it’s time. … In the long term it’s good for our economy.” Following the discussion with Rep. Foster, we welcomed four participants who offered insights into the recent experience of small businesses and entrepreneurs and what they might need from policymakers. Each began by citing what they consider to be the biggest challenge facing small businesses right now: It would be an understatement to say that the universe of small business finance has been undergoing changes. The COVID-19 pandemic was obviously a massive shock to the system and, as Congressman Foster pointed out, the federal government responded with equally massive financial support. The experience of small businesses with PPP and EIDL varied, but our panelists highlighted how remarkable these programs were. “We would not be in business were it not for PPP and the EIDL. I had a very positive experience working with the SBA and was really impressed with how quickly they were able to stand up this program for small business owners. … The process was surprisingly seamless for us and came at such a critical, critical time and allowed us to make the pivot. … SBA saved us.” &#8211; Angela McIver, president and founder Trapezium Math “Examining what the highest and best use of the SBA is, having served at the SBA, first and foremost you’ve got an amazing career staff that work there. They were obviously pushed to the limits when it came to PPP, working incredibly long hours across the board for the American people.” &#8211; Chris Pilkerton, chief legal and regulatory strategy officer, Accion Opportunity Fund Even prior to the pandemic, new financing innovations had been reshaping entrepreneurs’ access to capital for several years. Jamal Hagler pointed to the findings of an American Investment Council report on private credit. “It detailed all of the new strategies that asset managers have started to employ on the credit side, particularly direct lending and BDCs . We found, with regulatory shifts in the aftermath of the financial crisis, that more and more business loans are coming from non-bank&hellip;",

    "content": "Digital platforms are everywhere, from where we buy clothing to where we listen to music. The largest of these platforms have been receiving considerable antitrust scrutiny given their size and influence on our lives. Platform economics and the nature of digital markets should guide policymakers&#8217; thinking on these matters. This blog will be the first in a multi-part series on digital platforms designed to help policymakers better understand competition policy in the digital age. Part 1 will look at platform economics to help motivate some of the underlying logic behind many large tech firms’ business models. Part 2 in this series will look at digitization to help show how tech companies have leveraged digital technologies to grow. The remaining blogs will build on these two concepts and focus on their implications for competition and regulation. The term platform business can be vague, and experts can debate the precise definition. For our purposes, a platform business generally refers to a business that facilitates value-creating interactions between a large set of external parties that use the platform. They connect various external parties, such as sellers, buyers, readers, advertisers, recruiters, and job seekers, with each other. When referring to platform businesses, we will take a broad approach and include certain businesses that pre-date the internet to help highlight the effects of digitization in the next blog. A newspaper&#8217;s classified ads section is an example of a platform business. The classified ads section connects advertisers with people looking for these ads, while the newspaper typically makes money selling ad space in this section. Many tech companies leverage the platform business model. Modern platform businesses include social media sites, smartphones linking users with apps, and online marketplaces connecting buyers and sellers. Platform businesses often have few assets and employees relative to their market value since they rely heavily on external parties to create content, goods, and services for users. A platform business&#8217;s success often depends heavily on the success of these external parties, such as the creators of must-have apps or bestselling products accessible on the platform. Many of the key decisions a platform makes will be based on the ecosystem and relationship it wants to build with external parties. Platform businesses must make several critical decisions regarding their business and organizational structure. These decisions play a key role in guiding user interaction and value creation on the platform. Several questions platform business executives should answer include: What external parties should the platform connect? A platform business must decide what external parties it should connect. A platform might decide to connect recruiters with job seekers, drivers with riders, app makers with users, or other possible combinations. What is the right balance of external parties on the platform? A platform that connects different groups together must find the right balance between them to create a good user experience. For instance, a ridesharing platform will have to ensure it has the right mix of riders and drivers. If it gets this balance wrong, it can result in&hellip;",

    "content": "The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) included provisions that created the labor certification process that made importing foreign labor to the United States permissible, as long as it is established that there are not sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, or qualified for the occupation, and that employment of a foreign worker will not affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. That legal provision still serves as the language used by the Department of Labor when certifying labor applications for nonimmigrant workers. A change to the INA in 1965 required employers to file labor certification applications to permanently hire foreign employees. However, provisions within the INA allow some foreign workers to waive the requirement of a labor certification, or even a job offer, for permanent residency if the person’s qualifications and the desired employment is deemed in the national interest of the United States. This National Interest Waiver (NIW) has typically been decided based on three key criteria laid out in a precedent decision of USCIS’s Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) 1 in 2016, Matter of Dhanasar. Yet, how the waivers are used and who it applies to continues to evolve, making the program convoluted and hard to navigate for immigrants. Moreover, the open-ended nature of the waiver’s criteria as well as the reliance on adjudicator’s personal discretion to make decisions regarding NIWs makes the program precarious. The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT90) separated the existing employment-based immigrant visas from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 into five preference categories, which annually allocated a certain number of visas to foreign workers in each category (Figure 1). While the law allows those applying for an employment-based green card in the first preference category (EB-1) to self-petition for a visa, employers sponsoring foreign workers in the EB-2 and EB-3 visa categories are required to complete labor-market tests administered by the Department of Labor’s foreign labor certification program. There are exceptions to the labor certification process in the permanent labor-based employment visa system. If the Department of Labor deems that no U.S. worker is available for a given occupation due to generalized labor shortages and hiring a foreign worker for a particular occupation does not adversely impact U.S. workers, those jobs are listed on a “shortage occupation list,” or Schedule A. Currently, Schedule A occupations are classified into two groups: Group I for “physical therapists and professional nurses” and Group II for “aliens with exceptional ability.” Qualifying individuals in the EB-1 and EB-5 preferences and certain EB-4 preference workers can self-petition for an employment-based green-card without an employer and are not required to undergo any labor market tests. Lastly, certain EB-2 preference foreign nationals who qualify for a national interest waiver, can file for a green card without a specific job offer, and therefore forego a labor certification.2 In all these cases, documentation proving the qualification for the labor certification exemption category must be filed by the employer or the self-petitioner directly with the Department of&hellip;",

    "content": "In the flurry of congressional activity over the past few weeks, it might be easy to overlook an important development regarding infrastructure finance: the inclusion of a direct-pay bond program in the House Committee on Ways and Means’ reconciliation bill. This program, which has in the past garnered bipartisan support, could open up a new avenue for private investors to support urgently needed infrastructure projects. BPC has long supported direct-pay bonds as a way to bring private capital off the sidelines and put it to work building America’s infrastructure. Direct-pay bonds utilize the existing structure of the municipal bond market, but unlike traditional municipal bonds, the interest on direct-pay bonds is taxable. As a result, states and local governments issuing these types of bonds face higher interest costs. Investors who do not have federal tax liability do not benefit from the tax exemption for traditional municipal debt. These investors can include pension funds, insurance companies, and foreign investors. Taxable bonds are more attractive to this group but cost more for state and local governments to issue because of the higher interest rates. Under a direct-pay bond program, the issuer receives a payment from the federal government to help offset the higher interest costs. The goal of the program is to attract new investors into the market while not requiring states and local governments to pay more than they would if they were issuing traditional tax-exempt debt. Direct-pay bonds were authorized for a limited time as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 and were highly successful in raising capital for local governments, with $181 billion issued before the program ended in 2010, representing about 21% of the total debt issued in municipal bonds during that period. The Ways and Means bill would make direct payment bonds a long-term program and would protect the subsidy from potential cuts due to sequestration, which was a concern of issuers with the ARRA program. The Ways and Means bill also expands the availability of private activity bonds for water and wastewater projects and for infrastructure related to zero-emission vehicles, i.e. charging facilities. Private activity bonds are like traditional municipal debt but are available for certain types of infrastructure projects that are privately owned or operated, including airports, surface transportation projects, and water and wastewater facilities. However, the volume of tax-exempt PABs that states can issue per year is limited by federal law, as are the types of projects PABs can finance. The Ways and Means bill would raise the volume cap for water and wastewater facilities (the volume cap for surface transportation projects was raised in the bipartisan infrastructure bill) and expand PABs to include charging facilities. BPC has called for bipartisan infrastructure legislation to shore up aging assets, speed decarbonization of infrastructure, and demonstrate to the country that democratic processes remain strong. Both direct pay bonds and private activity bonds have received bipartisan support, and both could make a meaningful difference in attracting private investment to help meet our infrastructure&hellip;",

    "content": "HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher program helps low-income families cover the cost of renting private, market-rate housing units, which has proven effective in reducing overcrowding, homelessness, and housing instability. However, the program’s ultimate success depends on having voucher holders find and secure suitable housing as well as having landlords willing to accept vouchers as payment. HUD has studied landlord participation, finding evidence that: Landlords refuse to rent to voucher holders because of negative experiences with the program. Voucher acceptance rates are low across the country, with denials more common in low-poverty than high-poverty areas. Landlord participation has decreased in recent years, further concentrating voucher households in areas with high poverty rates. These trends undermine housing vouchers as a tool to combat poverty and provide families, particularly those with young children, with greater economic opportunities. To enhance the impact and effectiveness of the HCV program, policymakers must evaluate the reasons landlords do not accept vouchers and work to boost acceptance. Housing inspections required by the HCV program are a major disincentive for landlord participation. Public housing authorities carry out pre-move and annual inspections to ensure homes meet quality standards, checking for criteria related to safety, sanitation, and more. Property owners often report waiting days or weeks for inspections, delaying their ability to fill empty units. Inspections can also lead to mandated, costly repairs. In HUD-sponsored studies as well as listening forums and focus groups, landlords cited the unpredictability and inconsistency of inspections and required maintenance as a primary reason for refusing vouchers. Landlords also cite difficult experiences with (or distrust of) PHAs as a primary reason for refusing vouchers, as well as the time-consuming nature of coordinating with PHAs. Major problems include the paperwork required by property owners to rent to voucher recipients and late or insufficient payments by PHAs. Landlords also express frustration when PHAs do not take their side during owner-tenant conflicts and more generally feel they have less control over their business when dealing with the governmental entities. To address landlord concerns and incentivize increased HCV participation, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) introduced the bipartisan Choice in Affordable Housing Act (S. 1820). The bill would offer a financial bonus to PHAs that retain a dedicated landlord liaison on staff to manage PHA-landlord issues and disputes. To reduce inspection delays, the bill would allow units to meet voucher inspection requirements if they have been inspected in the past year. The bill also would offer incentives to landlords, including signing bonuses to landlords in low-poverty areas and security deposit assistance to protect against damages. Reforms by PHAs can also simplify and expedite the HCV process, such as giving each landlord a single point of contact, and hosting open houses with landlords to seek input on how to improve the process. In 2020, HUD issued guidance for PHAs to conduct inspections virtually through remote virtual inspections (RVIs), which have the potential to make the inspection process more efficient. HUD should continue to evaluate whether RVIs can sufficiently scan for&hellip;",

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center’s J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy recently hosted a webinar on HUD’s 18th biennial Worst Case Housing Needs report on renter households finding that the number of American households facing worst case needs held steady at 7.77 million. Although published this year, the report analyzes data from the American Housing Survey (AHS) through 2019 and reflects housing conditions before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. HUD characterizes renters with very low incomes that “lack housing assistance and have either severe rent burdens and/or severely inadequate housing,” as experiencing worst case housing needs. Of primary concern are very low income (VLI) and extremely low income (ELI) renters, households with incomes that are less than 50% and 30% of the area median income (AMI), respectively. For reference, the national median income for a VLI family of four in 2019 was approximately $32,000, and $21,000 for an ELI family. While favorable economic conditions raised median incomes nationwide between 2017 and 2019, a subsequent rise in average rents negated this positive development. As a result, severe rent burdens stemming from “insufficient income relative to rent” remained the primary driver of worst case needs, with an estimated 95.2% of the 7.77 million impacted households spending more than 50% of their incomes on housing costs. HUD identifies several key factors that contribute to severe rent burdens: Insufficient growth in the supply of affordable and available rental units; Insufficient government assistance; and Inadequate income growth relative to the increase in average rents. To reduce the number of families with worst case housing needs, the report calls for dramatically increasing both the availability of government assistance and the supply of affordable rental homes. Of the nearly 18.4 million VLI households in the U. S. 5.05 million, roughly one in four of those eligible, received housing assistance. The current shortage of affordable rentals is also striking: For every 100 VLI households, there were just 62 rental homes affordable and available to them, while only 40 rental homes were affordable and available to every 100 ELI households. One contributing factor to insufficient availability is the vigorous competition for good quality, affordable housing and the presence of higher-income earners living in rentals otherwise affordable to ELI and VLI households. Between 2017-2019, an estimated 42.7% of rental homes that were affordable to VLI and ELI households were occupied by higher-income families. Additionally, the report notes how increased landlord participation in the Housing Choice Voucher program can “improve access to units among very low-income households.” Worst case housing needs do not discriminate on the basis of geography or demography. Geographically, those facing worst case needs are dispersed throughout the country. Demographically, every racial and ethnic group witnessed increased numbers of those facing worst case needs, except for non-Hispanic whites who saw a 2% decrease among those contending with severe housing issues. Furthermore, the report found that the number of older adult renters with worst case needs increased by 607,000 between 2017-2019, a full percentage&hellip;",

    "content": "New technologies like the internet and artificial intelligence often bring important policy questions around access, inclusion, and economic issues. The internet and broadband technologies have raised questions about access and the digital divide. Artificial intelligence has highlighted challenges with bias and inclusion. Online digital platforms have brought economic questions about competition policy. Properly addressing these issues can help fully realize the potential of the technology, while limiting the downsides. Immersive technologies are similarly raising many questions around access, inclusion, and economic issues that we need to get ahead of through thoughtful deliberation. The Bipartisan Policy Center convened various stakeholders representing civil society, industry, and other relevant groups to discuss XR access, inclusion, and economic issues to help understand some of the debates we are likely to have in the coming years about these matters. The BPC convening featured broad discussions around access, inclusion, and economic issues, and it showed how interconnected these issues were. For instance, the cost of a VR headset serves as a barrier to access and inclusion, and it is also an economic issue. Additionally, while privacy and security were the focus of a previous convening, discussants regularly brought up these issues in the context of access and inclusion. For instance, several participants noted how addressing biometric data and bystander privacy issues were essential to build trust in the technology, ensure inclusion, and prevent harm. Ensuring Access The discussants focused on the digital divide as a significant access issue for immersive technologies since the foundational technologies needed to make XR work, like high-speed broadband, are a barrier for many. According to a report by Future Ready Schools, nearly 17 million schoolchildren in the United States do not have internet access at home. The group expressed concerns regarding the inability to solve the current high-speed internet access issues and its impact on the adaption of XR technology. Participants suggested that the adoption of personal computers in the 80s and 90s provide clues on how to make XR adaption more accessible. Discussants debated the role of industry and government in ensuring accessibility and proposed tools like industry commitments, public-private partnerships, and government investments as ways to achieve this goal. The convening featured conversation about how open XR platforms should be with some focus on current debates around today&#8217;s online digital platforms. Participants discussed the effects of walled ecosystems like app stores and logins, limiting the ability to access software and experiences. A participant argued a system that is too open might have unintended consequences, such as exposing users to more harmful content, which prompted a debate around the degree of platform openness and its costs and benefits. Participants further discussed how industry standards and public policy could address high-risk areas and the most potentially harmful content. A participant argued for the industry to agree on standards about what type of content to allow on XR platforms. Fostering Inclusion The group explored both the potential and challenges of XR when it comes to inclusion. The group discussed how XR technology&hellip;",

    "content": "The federal debt limit has historically been a partisan issue, but it has metastasized in recent years. This should not be surprising given how increased polarization has dominated our entire legislative process over the past several decades. As we look back at the debt limit cliff that was just narrowly avoided and forward to another event in the coming months, BPC’s goal is to continue providing objective analysis that can help inform policymakers and the public about this critical issue. When our analysis is used by one side or the other for political gain, it undermines the nuanced and unbiased perspective we have provided for the past decade. We therefore offer additional context here for how our “X Date” range should be understood and interpreted. Our principal reason for providing this context is concern that some readers have misinterpreted the window we present as a safe range to forestall default. This interpretation is a misreading of BPC’s analysis. BPC’s view has always been that policymakers must act before the beginning of the X Date range—ideally well before—if they wish to responsibly protect the U.S. and global economies. The ramifications of any missed payments could be severe, and even approaching the X Date has negative economic consequences. As we explain below, the risks of default increase every day starting at the front end of our projected range. Accordingly, venturing even one day into our projected range invites serious economic risk. On August 1, 2021, the federal debt limit was reinstated at $28.4 trillion, a level covering all borrowing that occurred while the debt limit was suspended over the prior two years. The country immediately hit this limit, and the Treasury Department was forced to rely on its remaining cash on hand and extraordinary measures to continue financing the government’s obligations. As during past debt limit episodes, BPC projected when the X Date—the point at which the U.S. would exhaust these resources and no longer be able to pay all its obligations in full and on time—would occur. Before President Joe Biden signed a $480 billion debt limit increase into law on October 14, 2021, BPC estimated that the country would cross the X Date sometime between October 19 and November 2. Rather than predicting a specific day when the United States is most likely to begin missing payments, BPC releases a range during which we are fairly confident that will occur. We take this approach for two reasons. First, all estimates of the X Date are subject to significant uncertainty. We are attempting to assess millions of payments flowing in and out of the federal government on a daily basis. The uncertainty has only been exacerbated this year by the unpredictable timing of COVID-19 relief spending and particularly volatile federal revenues. From basic statistics, our range is similar to a confidence interval that incorporates uncertainty—in contrast to a projection of a specific day, which does not. Second, given the grave consequences that could ensue if the nation crosses the X Date,&hellip;",

    "content": "Currently, Congressional Democrats are considering a paid family leave (PFL) program in the Build Back Better Act that would provide access to a leave benefit for parental, family caregiving, and medical needs, as well as needs related to a loved one’s military deployment. The current proposal would require the Treasury Department to implement the program no earlier than July 2023. To ensure a successful launch of the program as well as promote long-term durability, we propose that Congress direct the Treasury Department to stagger implementation of the program. Specifically, rather than attempting to start providing all benefits in July 2023, as is currently planned, we propose that Treasury launch the parental leave benefit in October 2022 followed by the other leave benefits in July 2024. Standing up a comprehensive PFL program by July 2023 would be a tall order. States have typically taken longer than 18 months to launch comparable programs. Washington state, for example, took 30 months to implement a similar comprehensive PFL program. Further complicating the proposed rollout, the Treasury Department does not typically oversee benefit programs and is not currently equipped to administer a new program that will directly process unique claims. The department would need to hire and train staff and set up the technical infrastructure to receive applications, verify past wages and supporting documentation, determine benefit amounts, and approve or deny claims within 15 days of receipt. The proposal would also require the Treasury to process monthly “benefit claim reports” for all active leave-takers. Much of the administrative difficulty stems from the wide range of circumstances for which leave is to be available. As illustrated in the table below, different types of leave will require substantially different documentation. Establishing procedures to verify this documentation, process different types of claims, approve legitimate applications, and minimize fraud will require significant planning. Key advantages of a staggered approach: Simplifies benefits administration: Applications for leave to bond with a new child would be the simplest for the Treasury Department to process. Such leave does not require the in-depth certification needed for other types of leave. Moreover, the reason and duration of leave following the birth of a child would typically be more predictable and uniform across claims. In contrast, when providing paid leave benefits for caring for an ill family member or personal health condition, the Treasury would have to consider a wide range of circumstances requiring individual attention. Improves the initial benefit claiming experience: By minimizing complexity in the implementation phase, Treasury would maximize the chances that Americans who are early participants have a positive experience with the program. Makes parental leave benefits available sooner than currently scheduled: By allowing the Treasury to focus on implementing the simplest benefits first, it would likely be able to provide paid parental leave sooner than July 2023. Provides opportunity to improve administration: Staggering the implementation would enable the Treasury Department to troubleshoot problems as they arise, improve benefits administration, and integrate best practices before launching the more complicated family caregiving and&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-standing health disparities and shined a light on the need for greater emphasis on health equity. The Biden administration is well-positioned to improve population health through ensuring executive branch collaboration, leveraging mandatory spending, and focusing on the leading causes of death. This blog provides a federal framework for population health improvement and outlines three overarching tactics to accelerate progress. Optimal population health requires a focus on public health, prevention, and primary care. Federal population health improvements must also take into consideration the social drivers of health, the conditions in which we live, learn, pray, and play, and the health inequities which lead to health disparities in this country. Public Health. COVID-19 has highlighted the gross underinvestment we have made in our nation’s public health system—in spite of public health efforts leading to the majority of gains in life expectancy during the previous century. While COVID-19 supplemental packages infused significant short-term funding into the system, long-term sustainable funding for the nation’s public health infrastructure remains lacking. Efforts to fill this gap are underway in Congress, and separately the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Future of Health Care Task Force recently issued recommendations to create a permanent mandatory account to address this shortfall. Prevention (clinical and community). Pre COVID-19, there were suboptimal and disparate uptake rates of high-value clinical preventive services, and studies have shown that Americans fell further behind in obtaining routine clinical preventive services such as cancer screenings because of the pandemic. Health care practitioners will need to prioritize helping patients catch up with necessary services. Community preventive services, such as smoke-free policies, motor vehicle injury prevention, and school-based health programs, are recommended by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services but supported by the federal government only through limited discretionary grants and have not been fully implemented at the state and local levels. Primary Care. As emphasized in a recent National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, Implementing High-Quality Primary Care: Rebuilding the Foundation of Health Care, primary care is one of the few medical services for which a greater supply leads to better and more equitable health outcomes. However, the U.S. spends half as much on primary care compared to other industrialized countries. Recommendations from the report for primary care payment reform, universal access to primary care, greater support of workforce programs, and the establishment of a Secretary’s Council on Primary Care are steps in the right direction. SDOH (Social Determinants of Health). The overarching drivers of health, such as food, education, economic stability, and the built environment, must be taken into account when formulating population health initiatives. This is emphasized as a key principle of Healthy People 2030 which correctly notes that “healthy physical, social and economic environments strengthen the potential to achieve health and well-being.” Equity. Encompassing all population health efforts, a focus on equity is critical to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity for health improvement. Tackling structural inequities will help to reverse the long-standing health disparities that we see&hellip;",

    "content": "Today, one in five Americans lives in a rural community, where access to local and convenient health services is far from a given. The situation has likely become worse with the closure of 138 rural hospitals over the last 10 years. Now, an opportunity for rural hospitals to focus more on emergency and outpatient services could help, but much will depend on how the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) implements it. Accessing care has long been a problem in rural areas. Rural residents on average travel twice as far as their urban counterparts to receive health care services. And of the hospitals that have kept their doors open, many have had to cut important services, such as obstetrics units. While rural hospitals benefited from federal financial assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts predict that some may again struggle to make ends meet, which is why ensuring success of the new Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) model is critical. Rural health care has long centered on inpatient hospital services. However, the need for inpatient care has diminished as medical advancements and innovations have allowed many common procedures to shift to the outpatient setting. For example, certain invasive and therapeutic surgeries that providers used to perform primarily in inpatient settings, like cataract surgery or certain knee and hernia repairs, now commonly take place in ambulatory settings. Meanwhile, rural populations continue to shrink, reducing the need for inpatient hospital beds. Over the last decade, the number of people living in rural areas declined by 0.5%, or 226,000 people, while urban areas grew by about 8%, or roughly 21 million people. Taken together, these trends have decreased the number of rural residents needing inpatient hospital care. Last December, Congress created the REH program, which holds great promise for stabilizing and expanding access to health care services in rural America. It gives rural communities a new care delivery option within the Medicare program and allows communities to transform inpatient hospitals into emergency and outpatient care facilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 created the new Medicare designation, which will take effect in 2023. Hospitals with fewer than 50 beds will be able to convert to the new model. Under the new program, REH facilities will be reimbursed for patient care via the Medicare outpatient prospective payment system. In addition, REHs will receive a new, additional “facility payment” that stakeholders hope will be used to provide extra medical and support services. These additional patient services could include wellness and preventive care, behavioral health, oral health care services, and other patient supports, like transportation to medical appointments and nutrition assistance. This is good news for rural residents and rural communities. Regulators are working to flesh out the details of the Rural Emergency Hospital Program. The Bipartisan Policy Center recently submitted comments to HHS highlighting a range of important issues to be considered as this new model comes on-line. BPC’s key comments include recommendations for HHS to: Allow REHs to provide care via telehealth and virtual health&hellip;",

Climeworks, the Swiss company behind Orca, accomplished this landmark achievement by forging strong partnerships with local Icelandic companies, including ON Power (which provides geothermal power to run the facility) and CarbFix (which mineralizes and permanently sequesters the CO2 underground) and by building upon the existing relationships these companies have with stakeholder groups. Orca provides a unique example of how DAC can successfully transition from concept to real-world implementation when developers consider both the physical environment as well as the social dimensions. As is true for many emerging climate technologies, scaling up DAC will be as much a technological challenge as a sociological one, necessitating community acceptance, support, and even excitement for carbon removal. The lessons learned from Orca today and in the years ahead are important for future DAC deployments around the world. Under Iceland’s surface, the European and North American tectonic plates are actively pulling away from one another, making it one of the most geologically active regions on the planet. In March 2021, the Fagradalsfjall volcano erupted just one hour southwest of Orca, spewing liquid-hot lava and creating entirely new earth. As that lava cools, new igneous rocks like basalt and obsidian are born. This process has been happening for the last million years, forming the stunning rocky terrain of this island nation. Harnessing this geologic activity, Iceland has established itself as a world leader in deploying geothermal energy. At present, Iceland’s electric grid is powered 100% by renewable sources, primarily geothermal and hydropower, and serves a population of around 350,000 residents — a little more than half the population of Wyoming. Several decades ago, the Icelandic government worked in tandem with local energy companies to attract industries that could benefit from abundant, low-cost renewable energy. This resulted in a major surge in heavy industry in Iceland, and aluminum overtook fish as the country’s largest export. But this didn’t come without its challenges. Many local groups voiced strong opposition to industrial development, eventually resulting in the creation of a new political party in 2007 known as the “Iceland Movement,” whose main political position was to oppose any additional industrial growth. While heavy industrial production is quite distinct from DAC, this turbulent history in Iceland serves as a reminder that successful deployment of climate technologies relies on thoughtful and anticipatory community engagement. This context also helps to set the stage for some of the local history and perspectives that Climeworks had to consider as it began its plans for Orca. By choosing a site in Hellisheidi, Iceland, Climeworks was able to capitalize on colocation with geothermal energy sources and well-understood technology and geology for mineralization and storage. This reduced the&hellip;",

    "content": "The Continuing Resolution (Public Law 117-43) signed by President Biden on September 30, 2021 included the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022, which provided $28 billion in disaster relief spending to a range of federal agencies. One of the most significant line items is $5 billion for HUD’s Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program. This is the first CDBG-DR appropriation in more than two years; therefore, the funding will be directed toward major declared disasters that occurred in both 2020 and 2021. Given the lag between previous disasters and this appropriation, Congress directed HUD to quickly allocate—no later than October 30, 2021—at least $1.6 billion of that amount to areas where major disasters that occurred last year. HUD may also opt to make a “down payment” on major disasters that have occurred already this year, like Hurricane Ida, while reserving the balance for later allocation once unmet need data is developed and address any events for which there is a disaster declaration between today and December 31. Many aspects of the recent appropriation language are familiar to the CDBG-DR program: Uses of funds encompass disaster relief, long-term recovery, housing, infrastructure, economic revitalization and mitigation. HUD will issue a Federal Register notice to govern the funds with the authority to waive and establish alternative requirements to statutory and regulatory requirements administered by HUD. Grantees will have to prepare a disaster recovery action plan for approval by HUD in order to access the allocated funds. Grantees will have to demonstrate that they have proficient financial controls, procurement processes, and procedures to ensure duplication of benefits (i.e., using multiple federal funding sources for the same purpose or activity) does not occur. Limited relief is provided for grantees to use environmental reviews done by other federal agencies, most notably in conjunction with projects funded by FEMA’s Public Assistance program. However, there are also several unique provisions within the language. One key nuance is the directive for HUD to include in a grantee’s allocation an amount equal to 15% of calculated unmet need for hazard mitigation—investments to reduce the long-term risks posed by disasters. HUD has occasionally added mitigation funding as an administrative “plus up” to unmet needs. This was the case after Hurricane Sandy in 2012; however, in 2018, Congress specified a mitigation formula that accrued significant benefit to jurisdictions struck by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. To counter the primary criticisms of CDBG-DR, namely that it takes too long for the funding to reach disaster-impacted populations, Congress included a provision that enables CDBG-DR grantees who received funds in response to qualifying events between 2017 and 2019 to amend their existing action plans and programs to encompass “those impacted by disasters in 2020 and 2021.” However, the window to use this authority may be short lived as it is open only until such time as HUD issues a Federal Register notice to govern the newly appropriated funds.

    "content": "A primary objective of a paid family leave (PFL) program is to keep leave-takers attached to the workforce. PFL helps working caregivers—particularly women—stay in the labor force, support their households, and grow the economy. To maximize these workforce benefits, a PFL program should be designed as an earned benefit that is targeted at workers. As lawmakers mull modifications to the proposal currently under consideration, Congress should strengthen workforce attachment by making two important changes: Requiring employment at the time an application for the benefit is filed. Removing unemployment compensation from the definition of wages that determine eligibility and benefit amounts. These modifications would not only enhance the PFL program&#8217;s capacity to support working families and help the economy—it would also help ensure the program’s long-term durability. In the Build Back Better Act, the reconciliation package currently under consideration on Capitol Hill, House Democrats have taken a major step toward a comprehensive PFL program. PFL—especially paid parental leave—has broad bipartisan support and can bring significant benefits to workers, parents, and children. These benefits stem, in large part, from PFL’s unique ability to support workforce attachment by preventing the substantial career disruptions that can result from caregiving and parenting responsibilities, particularly for women and people of color. A robust body of economic research demonstrates that by enabling employees to take time away from work for caregiving, PFL increases the chances that workers return to their jobs. Key findings include: California’s paid leave program increased weekly work hours of employed mothers by 10% to 17% and increased the likelihood of female employment one year after childbirth by 23%. Women who take paid family leave after giving birth are 40% more likely to return to work than those without the benefit. A decade after childbirth, the labor force participation rate among women who received paid family leave is 82%, compared to 64% of women who quit during pregnancy. The economic and workforce benefits of PFL have been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in substantial caregiving responsibilities that impacted women, families, and workers. Recent BPC-Morning Consult polling revealed that 71% of adults with paid family leave say the benefit helped them continue to work during the pandemic and that 37% of unemployed adults say they would be more likely to return to work sooner if their employer offered PFL. The centrality of labor force participation to PFL is recognized by every state with a PFL program (and the majority of OECD nations), which administer PFL as an “earned benefit,” requiring a combination of recent work and earnings to be eligible. Under these programs, individuals must make a minimum amount of payroll contributions and/or work for a minimum period to access the PFL benefit. Leave benefits currently offered by the federal government have similar requirements. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), which provides unpaid leave, employees are eligible for the leave benefit after 12 months with a single employer (as well as at least 1,250 hours of work in&hellip;",

    "content": "American infrastructure is poised for an unprecedented level of federal investment, as two major infrastructure bills make their way through Congress: the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the forthcoming reconciliation bill. While the IIJA represents a more traditional reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs, the reconciliation process has taken a different tack, which may present an opening for private investors looking to participate in infrastructure projects. One factor influencing the reconciliation bill’s physical infrastructure programs is the White House’s promise that the bill would not “double dip,” i.e., address programs already negotiated in the IIJA. As a result, congressional drafters were unable to simply add funding to existing transportation programs reauthorized in the IIJA. Instead, they crafted several new programs addressing specific priorities, including connections to affordable housing, emissions reduction, high-speed rail, and rebuilding communities. The rules of reconciliation itself are another factor at play, particularly the requirement that all legislative provisions be primarily focused on funding, not policy. Thus, the new programs proposed in reconciliation are clear in funding amounts but relatively sparse in other details, providing the outlines of the programs while granting DOT significant authority to flesh out the criteria for evaluation and awards. (This trend toward discretionary programs in surface transportation is also reflected in the IIJA, where $100 billion will be doled out through competitive awards rather than congressionally established formulas.) BPC has done extensive research into the important role of public-private partnerships and other forms of private investment in infrastructure and strategies for increasing that investment. Viewed through this lens, the shift toward discretionary programs could be a positive step, if certain principles are followed: To ensure that these grant programs deliver the intended benefits, Congress also has an important role to play: providing the funding for staff at DOT to administer the programs. One of the biggest barriers to attracting private capital to infrastructure projects is the uncertainty of project schedules stemming from the possibility of permitting and approval delays. The reconciliation bill represents a significant increase in discretionary programs beyond what even the IIJA envisions. DOT will need to develop guidelines and review hundreds of applications for each new program. Once awards are made, staff will need to ensure that permits are issued in a timely manner to keep projects on schedule. The responsibilities themselves are not new for DOT – after all, they have been in the business of grant-making for decades – but the scale of this endeavor sets it apart from the past. Should these bills pass, they represent a historic infusion of funding into the nation’s infrastructure. Taxpayers will be best served by an approach that welcomes private investment in new transportation projects. Only by bringing the public and private sectors together can we address the urgent infrastructure needs our nation faces.

    "content": "There is increasing momentum in Congress to expand Pell Grant eligibility to students enrolled in short-term vocational programs. Advocates argue these programs allow Americans with only a high school education to gain valuable skills and credentials for the workforce in less time than a traditional college degree. Detractors say outcomes differ substantially across programs, and they point to the fact that many graduates of these programs still earn poverty-level wages. An experimental study was conducted by the Department of Education to assess the impact of expanding Pell eligibility to short-term programs, but it failed to measure post-graduation employment and earnings outcomes. Thus, with Pell-eligibility potentially on the horizon, there remains a need to ensure these programs lead to credentials that enable viable employment at wages that do not trap individuals in poverty. With the variable outcomes produced by short-term vocational programs, proposals to expand Pell Grants must set rigorous accountability standards to ensure credentials earned have value, thereby protecting students and preventing taxpayer dollars from being wasted. Below we assess several potential standards that policymakers could apply to ensure only high-quality programs are eligible for short-term Pell dollars. The most prominent legislative proposal to expand Pell eligibility to short-term programs, the JOBs Act, would make programs in locally recognized, in-demand industries eligible to receive Pell funding. Certificates in in-demand industries, however, often don’t lead to high-quality jobs. Indeed, the aforementioned pilot study conducted by the Department of Education found that the vast majority of students who completed a short-term program in an in-demand field pursed credentials in transportation and material moving (65%) or health professions (24%), both of which often lead to jobs with high turnover and low wages. Therefore, requiring programs to focus on in-demand industries does little to ensure program quality or guarantee good employment outcomes for graduates. The 70-70 rule would condition Pell eligibility for short-term vocational programs to those having both a completion and job-placement rate of at least 70%. The rule is already used as an eligibility requirement for short-term programs, ranging from 300 to 600 clock hours, to participate in the federal student loan program. Despite this requirement, short-term programs that produce relatively poor earnings outcomes for their students remain eligible. In fact, a recent analysis from the Brookings Institution found that, among students who graduated from short-term programs that passed the 70-70 rule, average annual earnings were only $24,000—equivalent to only $12 per hour for a full-time worker. These sorts of outcomes—where wages are beneath the average median wage of a high school graduate—are unsurprising. High completion rates are easy to achieve in a short-term program that lasts only a few weeks or months. Additionally, job placement rates lack a standardized definition, are self-reported, and can be easily gamed by institutions. For example, the rates often only measure whether a graduate secured any job, regardless of its relevance to their course of study. Given the flaws with using completion and job placement rates when assessing short-term program quality, the 70-70 rule alone seems&hellip;",

Radon testing requirements are an important measure to protect households, and such requirements should be based on rigorous scientific analysis and designed to produce the best outcomes for households. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is reviewing radon testing requirements for multifamily housing units financed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Specifically, FHFA is considering a nationwide policy requiring 100% inspection for ground floor units, testing a smaller percentage of units on other floors, and additional quality control testing. BPC’s Housing Advisory Council—a group of experts focused on advancing equity and opportunity through housing—wrote a letter to the FHFA expressing concerns that such a requirement is not based on the most up-to-date science, could prove challenging and costly to implement, and could be disruptive to tenants and property owners.

    "content": "Over the past decade, the U.S. federal government has repeatedly run up against its debt limit and neared the point of being unable to fund its commitments. Crossing that ominous threshold has been termed by some as “default by another name.” Meanwhile, others have asserted that the Treasury Department could prioritize certain payments, allowing the government to continue making good on its debt obligations and its most important benefit programs while biding time for policymakers to resolve the impasse. But just how realistic is that scenario? No one really knows, but at a minimum, it would carry profound risks to the American economy, and could damage its prosperity if global markets were to lose confidence in the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Most recently, the nation’s debt limit was raised by $480 billion to approximately $28.9 trillion. However, once reached and the Treasury Department no longer has the ability to continue paying the nations bills using extraordinary measures and available cash on hand – a day we call the “X Date” – the federal government will be unable to meet all its obligations in full and on time. There is no established playbook for the Treasury Department if Congress fails to raise or suspend the debt limit in the coming weeks. Officials have long denied the existence of any Plan B to finance government operations past the X Date. The Treasury Department will not attempt a “fire sale” of financial assets as a way to avoid or delay congressional action on the debt limit. Other previous suggestions—from minting a trillion-dollar coin to deposit at the Federal Reserve, to issuing IOUs that could be sold and traded in private markets, to unilaterally declaring that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment nullifies the debt limit—have been deemed impractical, possibly illegal, and could bring the U.S. government uncomfortably close to the image of a banana republic in the eyes of investors. The Treasury Department could, in theory, employ one of two untested strategies: making payments in priority order or making full days’ worth of payments once it receives sufficient revenues to cover all of a day’s obligations. Upon reaching the X Date, the Treasury Department might attempt to prioritize some types of payments over others. Prioritized payments would be made on time, others would not. Such a strategy would entail sorting and choosing from hundreds of millions of monthly payments, stretching the limits of the Treasury Department’s financial technology systems and forcing executive branch officials to pick winners and losers from among the programs that lawmakers have authorized. Under the best of circumstances, processing all payments on a day-to-day basis for critical government priorities—such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, national defense, and salaries for the military—while at the same time declining others would be a logistically excruciating task. The Treasury Department may have the technological capability to prioritize interest payments on the federal debt over other obligations, a possibility that reinvigorated the prioritization debate in 2014.

    "content": "Every year, millions of older adults and people with disabilities have their health care needs met in their homes and communities in a cost-effective and inclusive manner. Yet hundreds of thousands of people are on waiting lists for home and community-based services (HCBS) right now, and many more are without access to comprehensive home care options due to restrictive state Medicaid programs and increasing provider shortages The sad reality is that nearly 140,000 nursing home patients and staff lost their lives during the pandemic and over 1.3 million nursing home patients and staff contracted COVID-19. For decades, our nation has failed to make a meaningful investment in creating affordable and accessible home and community-based care. Many older adults and individuals with disabilities are placed in high-risk settings such as nursing homes—not because they need skilled medical care, but because it is difficult to find and afford home health aides, adult day programs, and other paid care that allows them to age in place. To keep this vulnerable population safe, policy makers must get serious about caring for more older adults and those with disabilities in their homes and communities. Between the COVID-19 pandemic, a rapidly growing older population (one in five U.S. adults will be 65 years-old or older by 2030), and critical provider shortages, reforming how we deliver and finance long-term care has never been more urgent. To address these issues, the Bipartisan Policy Center recently released a report outlining policies to make long-term care more affordable for middle- and low-income individuals. The recommendations include enabling Medicare beneficiaries to purchase HCBS, creating a tax credit to assist family caregivers, and investing in the direct care workforce and infrastructure. Long-term services and supports (LTSS)—think of them as the vehicle for long-term care—include a range of health, health-related, and social services for people who have functional limitations due to old age, chronic illness, cognitive impairment, disability, or other limitations that restrict their ability to care for themselves. LTSS can be provided where an individual already lives, like HCBS, or in institutions (like nursing homes). Services range from helping individuals eat and get dressed to managing medications and money. The need for LTSS in the U.S. is significant and growing: about 10,000 Americans turn 65 years-old each day, and over half of them (56%) will have LTSS needs at some point in their life. There has been a sizeable shift over the past 30 years toward delivering more LTSS in home and community-based settings rather than institutional settings. Aging in place is extremely desirable, allows older individuals and those with disabilities to lead independent lives, and has demonstrated savings compared to institutional care—for older individuals, people with disabilities, and states. Today, the national median annual price of a home health aide ($54,912) is half that of nursing home care ($105,850), and adult day care is one-fifth the cost ($19,240). One of the primary challenges people face is accessing paid HCBS. Despite being created for Americans age 65 and older, Medicare does not&hellip;",

    "content": "As part of an ongoing series of blogs on AI case studies where we introduce examples of real-world machine learning applications and their complexities, we will discuss the foundational tools needed for some machine learning models where information is limited or restricted. In a data hungry world, the use of augmented or synthetic data is essential to produce or validate predictive models, train AI, or correct for errors or bias in datasets. But synthetic data does not have the granularity of the real data. The use of synthetic data has advantages and disadvantages, and data users and policymakers must be aware of the associated tradeoffs. As mentioned in our AI and Ethics report, research must be done to address ethical components of AI, including privacy, bias, and fairness, to which use of synthetic data could be of value. Greater research is needed to understand varying degrees of efficacy for different applications of synthetic data and their implications on ethical use of AI. In this blog, we will outline common use-cases of synthetic data and consider potential risks and advantages. There are a few ways to generate ‘anonymized’ data from ‘real’ data. Using a running example of a dataset including people’s age, sex, car model, and license plate number: Dropout of records or features. Features may be removed from all records. License plate numbers, for example, that may risk allowing a third party to identify individuals could be removed from the data. Similarly, records with extreme outlier values (for example, a 110-year-old man driving a school bus) may be removed since these records would only be reasonably associated with a small number of people. Aggregation. Data may be aggregated such that individuals are no longer present in the data. For example, vehicle ownership data could be summarized by model of car, reporting only average age and proportion of male to female drivers. Generalization. Certain continuous values may be reduced in precision and ‘binned’. For example, instead of reporting exact age, the example data may report age ranges (16-26, 27-36, 37-46, etc.). Synthesis. Using the original ‘real’ data to train a machine learning generator, data can be generated that have many of the same statistical characteristics as the ‘real’ data (similar means, correlations between features, etc.) while not being directly associated with any one individual. Among synthetic data, there are two main categories. There is fully synthetic, where all data is computer-generated from a model trained using ‘real’ data and all real data are withheld. Then, there is partially synthetic, where computer-generated data are used to balance a dataset with respect to some sensitive characteristic (age or sex, for example), meaning that underrepresented characteristics are some combination of real and synthetic. Synthetic data is often used in replacement of real data to: Train data for machine learning algorithms; Overcome data usage restrictions; Overcome data usage restrictions; Minimize the costs of collecting real data; Obtain access to centralized datasets; or Produce situations that have not yet happened (i.e. testing a new product before&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress allocated billions in funding for Emergency Rental Assistance to help households facing financial hardships due to the pandemic—but local programs have been slow to distribute these federal dollars to eligible families. Major sources of delay include burdensome documentation requirements, a lack of awareness about the assistance, and the challenge of creating and scaling new programs to distribute the assistance. After the pandemic subsides, transitioning Emergency Rental Assistance into a permanent program could be an impactful way to help families deal with financial shocks. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, Congress established the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program, approving $46.6 billion for households affected by the economic consequences of the pandemic and struggling to pay rent. COVID-19 exposed the financial insecurity of many households; with the sudden loss of jobs and income, struggling families missed rent payments and began accruing housing-related debt. Under the ERA program, the Treasury Department provides formula funding to states and localities, which distribute the money to nearly 500 new and existing ERA programs that mainly offer rent and utility assistance. The Supreme Court struck down the CDC’s moratorium on evictions on August 26. About 1.4 million Americans are very likely to face eviction in the next two months, according to census survey data, while the Urban Institute estimates 3 million households will face eviction by the end of the year without assistance. Eviction is often devastating for a family’s economic prospects, leading to multiple unwanted moves or homelessness, long-term difficulty securing housing, as well as potential job losses and health issues. While the U.S. has not experienced a nationwide spike in eviction filings since the end of the eviction moratorium last month, housing advocates warn that it is still too soon to say whether a wave of evictions will occur—an increase in evictions could be gradual rather than sudden. As of September 2021, more than eight months after the ERA program was signed into law, only $9.4 billion (about 20%) of ERA funds were approved or paid to households. Efficient distribution of aid would be very effective at staving off evictions, as every state has been allocated enough assistance to cover all estimated back rent. Sadly, assistance has not been quick enough at reaching those who need it. Starting September 30, U.S. Treasury Dept. can “claw back,” or rescind, ERA funds from states, cities, and counties that have spent fewer than 65% of their first set of funding. However, in early October Treasury announced that state and local governments have until November 15 to avoid clawbacks if they submit an improvement plan. Delays in distributing funds stem partly from the complexity and scale of the task. Many of the hundreds of ERA programs are brand new and had to hire staff, scale technical capacity, and develop rules for directing federal dollars. Both new and previously existing programs had limited capacity, dealing with far more applications than they could quickly process. In fact, 60% of program administrators surveyed identified staff capacity as a major hurdle. In&hellip;",

    "content": "The United States officially withdrew from Afghanistan on August 30 after evacuating more than 120,000 people from the country, in one of the largest airlifts in history. Despite the massive number of people evacuated, estimates suggest that approximately 250,000 Afghans remain in Afghanistan who may still be eligible for expedited U.S. visas.1 As of September 14, 64,000 Afghan evacuees had arrived in the United States; it is unclear how many are Special Immigrant Visa holders (SIVs), how many are U.S. citizens, and how many are “vulnerable Afghans,” which is a mix of SIV holders, other visa holders, visa applicants who have not yet completed processing, or other potentially vulnerable categories. SIVs are Afghans who worked for the U.S. government or U.S. government contractors for at least a year; family members (spouse and unmarried children younger than 21) can also be granted an SIV. As of September 24, 53,500 Afghan evacuees are being held at the eight military sites designated to temporarily host Afghans, with the largest number at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. States have begun to learn how many Afghan evacuees (of the first approximately 37,000-40,000 who arrived in the U.S.) are expected to be resettled in their state, as the Department of Homeland Security continues to move evacuees through the operational phases of Operation Allies Welcome. The United States faces an incredibly complex challenge in welcoming this large influx of Afghan evacuees that has bypassed much of the traditional refugee resettlement process. Although the Afghans who were evacuated and brought to the United States have been generally referred to as “refugees” in the media, most of them do not have refugee status. Traditionally, refugees and SIV visa holders go through a long resettlement process involving multiple interviews and screenings overseas, including undertaking a 14-step process to obtain an SIV, which can take up to three years. Once they are approved for resettlement, different government and non-profit agencies step in to arrange transport to the United States and help integrate them into their new communities. However, the majority of Afghans arriving in the United States are being ushered in as “humanitarian parolees,” not traditional refugees, and most have not yet completed the process to obtain an SIV. Humanitarian parole is used to admit to the United States someone who is otherwise inadmissible (for example because they don’t have the proper visa) when there is a humanitarian interest to doing so. Parole is granted for a temporary period of time, usually one year, though U.S. immigration officials may add another 12 months in case of emergency. On August 26, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services published information about how Afghans outside the United States could request parole. USCIS specified that though parole allows the person to lawfully reside in the United States during the parole period, the person still technically remains an applicant for admission. Parole does not grant formal immigration status and does not lay out a path to permanent residency, nor does it give the parolee the ability to acquire&hellip;",

It’s official; the largest direct air capture (DAC) with permanent storage facility in the world is operational. Climeworks, a company I co-founded, has started removing CO2 from the atmosphere at the geothermal park in Hellisheidi, Iceland. The plant, named Orca, is made up of 8 collector containers that have a nominal cumulative capacity to remove 4,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. This project will combine Climeworks’ DAC technology with ON Power’s renewable geothermal heat and electricity and Carbfix’s geologic storage expertise based on their rapid CO2 mineralization approach. The location is ideal because it’s essentially a cluster where we have direct and constant access to a supply of renewable energy and we sit on top of abundant layers of basaltic rock where the captured CO2 can be safely and permanently stored. In this process, Climeworks captures CO2 from the atmosphere, and CarbFix mixes CO2 with water and subsequently injects the mixture deep underground. There the CO2 reacts with basaltic rock to form a solid mineral carbonate. This permanently stores the atmospheric CO2 and has been shown to mineralize 95% of the CO2 in just two years, which is substantially faster than the millennia required for natural mineralization to occur without human intervention. As a business, Climeworks has focused primarily on providing carbon removal services. We offer both corporate and individual customers to permanently remove CO2 in their name. Our subscription service for individual customers has over 8,000 monthly subscribers from 56 different countries, while on the corporate side we are proud to have Microsoft, Swiss Re, Stripe, Shopify, the Economist, Audi and other corporate customers who are all committed to removing CO2 to achieve their corporate climate targets. We have a number of long-term contractual agreements, such as a 10-year delivery contract with Swiss Re, that sends an important signal to the market and provides certainty for Climeworks to move forward, scale up, and further reduce costs through economies of scale. While Orca is a fairly small industrial facility, it represents a major milestone in the commercial development of DAC technologies. It is presently the largest DAC plant in the world, but because our technology is modular and now fully demonstrated, it is only the beginning of what is possible. Climeworks has the mission to not just halt climate change but to reverse it. We want to be very clear that emissions reductions and avoidance efforts must be front and center, but we are also confident that Climeworks and DAC can help cover an&hellip;",

    "content": "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a bipartisan infrastructure bill that has been described at times as a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure and a major down payment to fund climate and clean energy priorities. This legislation represents a significant—and essential—step forward in federal efforts to transition the United States toward a net-zero carbon emitting economy. Some have criticized the bill’s climate benefits for not including direct regulations to reduce emissions. But this assessment is misguided. Any successful, multi-decade strategy to address the risks of climate change must include a portfolio of programs focused on (1) technology development, (2) enabling infrastructure, and (3) market signals or regulations. The IIJA provides a strong push on the first two elements, even though it is not designed to be a comprehensive climate bill. More policy will be needed going forward, but these provisions are critical pieces of a climate policy agenda and will drive significant carbon emissions reductions over time. When getting a loan to buy a house, the size of the down payment matters a lot for overall costs and how quickly the ultimate goal—i.e., owning a home outright—can be achieved. In this sense, the IIJA works in much the same way. It represents a massive upfront investment that will dramatically enhance energy innovation progress, reduce the costs of our most promising advanced energy technologies, and bring forward in time their deployment trajectories. Accomplishing all of this will make it more likely and less expensive to reach our climate goals. Rapid progress toward decarbonizing the global economy is needed over the next several decades to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The Biden administration has set both interim and mid-century goals to direct America’s energy transition: net-zero U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a 50% reduction from peak U.S. emissions (2005 levels) over the next decade, by 2030. To date, clean energy innovation has taken an outsized role in enabling U.S. emissions reductions. Federal programs to drive down the costs of wind and solar have been wildly successful. Without concerted R&amp;D spending from both the public and private sectors, the U.S. would not have the suite of commercial low- and zero-carbon technology options it has today for decarbonized electricity, buildings, and passenger vehicles, in particular. These technologies underpin our expectations of how rapidly and cost-effectively the United States can reduce its GHG emissions; without them, the 2030 goal would be a stretch. Even with the clean energy technologies in the marketplace today, it’s clear we will need more tools to hit our long-term goals, and there are other obstacles looming. For example, we see significant uncertainties regarding America’s ability to site, permit, and build infrastructure at a fundamentally faster pace. The IIJA creates both near-term (i.e., over the next decade) and long-term enabling conditions for the U.S. to address GHG emissions that will need to be eliminated by 2050. It accomplishes this goal with four critical pathways: (1) R&amp;D, (2) demonstration projects, (3) backbone infrastructure for net-zero, and (4)&hellip;",

    "content": "Crossing the X Date would be an unprecedented economic event with domestic and global implications, as evidenced by market reactions to recent debt limit standoffs. After reaching the X Date, the Treasury Department would be unable to pay a substantial portion of its bills in full and on time, potentially including critical expenses like military pay and advanced child tax credit payments. Confusion over delayed payments and the consequences of defaulting on some of our obligations would likely prompt a downgrade of the country’s credit rating and lead investors to demand a higher rate of return on Treasury securities. Even a short-term default could lead to higher borrowing costs and liquidity concerns for the private sector, increased unemployment, stock market losses, and GDP contraction, further threatening the country’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and recession. Over the past decade, the U. S. federal government has repeated found itself in a familiar, yet avoidable, situation: on the brink of failing to meet its obligations. Most recently, the nation’s debt limit was raised by $480 billion to approximately $28.9 trillion. However, once reached and the Treasury Department no longer has the ability to continue paying the nations bills using extraordinary measures and available cash on hand – a day we call the “X Date” – Congress will need to take action. Policymakers are all too familiar with the debt limit from their battles over the past decade. Indeed, previous close calls have revealed real costs to such brinkmanship. In 1979, after a debt limit showdown and technical glitches caused the Treasury Department to delay 4,000 payments on maturing securities totaling an estimated $122 million, short-term interest rates spiked by approximately 60 basis points. In 2011, even flirting with the X Date cost taxpayers: that year’s debt limit episode increased the department’s borrowing costs and caused Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s to downgrade the U.S. long-term sovereign credit rating for the first time. What is less understood are the costs associated with crossing the X Date. That is because Congress has avoided it, albeit narrowly on occasion, by raising or suspending the debt limit numerous times—in fact, every time it was needed and traditionally with bipartisan support. In a world where the Treasury Department is only able to pay a portion of its bills, the choices about which obligations get paid and when “would not be pretty,” according to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. If Congress fails to act before the X Date, the Treasury Department would find itself unable to pay all the government’s bills. While the Treasury Department may have the capability to prioritize certain obligations—such as interest and principal payments on debt—an immediate cash flow shortage would force the federal government to miss or delay critical payments. These could include programs that touch nearly every American, from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to military and federal salaries and veterans’ benefits. The number of missed checks would likely grow rapidly as the standoff intensified, causing widespread confusion and income shocks for households and&hellip;",

    "content": "The bipartisan, Senate-passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act marks a big win for our country’s aging electric grid. Among the many energy infrastructure-related investments outlined in the first, second, and third posts of this blog series, the IIJA provides $27.65 billion to improve grid resilience and reliability, including $12.5 billion in borrowing authority. It also reduces siting and permitting barriers currently hampering much needed transmission buildout. There are three main reasons why upgrading and massively expanding the grid is needed now: Growing variable renewable generation – A substantial buildout of renewables is expected over the next few decades due to the rapidly declining costs of wind and solar technologies and the need to meet mid-century climate goals. Because wind and solar resources aren&#8217;t constantly available and predictable, a more integrated grid is needed to match electricity generation to demand, which is the foundation of grid reliability. Additional transmission development will also be needed to connect new renewable generation capacity (often located in remote areas) to population centers (see Figure 1). Electrification – Coupling power sector decarbonization with the electrification of other sectors of the economy, including transportation and buildings, is crucial for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. As part of the Decarb America Research Initiative, BPC has found that electricity demand will more than double over the next 30 years on the path to net zero. This can’t be achieved without significantly expanding our current transmission capacity. Increased need for resilience – Our grid is vulnerable to the physical impacts of extreme weather and wildfires, as evidenced by the 2021 Texas power crisis, and cyberattacks from foreign entities. A more interconnected grid creates redundancy which can improve resilience to both storms and national security threats. Figure 1. Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution (adapted from National Energy Education Development Project).  Despite the urgent need to modernize and expand our grid, siting and permitting challenges can cause significant delays in transmission projects. A report released by WIRES, a non-profit advocating for high-voltage transmission buildout, found that regulatory barriers can considerably slow down the development of new transmission lines. Projects can take up to ten years or longer, even with federal support. For example, the Plains and Eastern Clean Line Project proposed in 2010 sought to bring affordable wind energy from the Midwest to the east, but even with the Department of Energy acting as partner for two years of the project, it has yet to be completed. BPC’s Smarter, Cleaner, Faster Task Force released a set of recommendations aimed at modernizing the current regulatory system to build smarter, cleaner infrastructure at a fast enough rate to mitigate climate change while supporting a globally competitive economy. The IIJA provisions on transmission permitting and siting are aligned with these recommendations. By pairing investments with regulatory updates for transmission, the bill will pave the way for the deployment of clean energy technologies across the country. $5 billion for a grant program to prevent outages and enhance grid resilience – This program will provide grants to grid&hellip;",

    "content": "As more research has been conducted on the short- and long-term effects of opioid addiction, one group is particularly impacted by substance abuse: infants and children of those who use opioids. Infants who are exposed to opioids in the womb are often diagnosed with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Opioid addiction rates are rising among women and mothers, and American Indian and Alaska Native populations have the highest rates of addiction. Their children are the most at-risk for NAS. Since NAS can present in children in a wide variety of ways, it’s important that early interventions and educational services take place in child care settings, in addition to homes. Child care providers and early educators need to be aware of the impacts of opioid addition on children in order to better serve families. Child care providers who serve American Indian and Alaska Native populations need to be acutely aware of this, as native populations have the highest rates of addition. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 10.2% of AI/AN adults have a substance use disorder, which is higher than the U.S. total population of 7.4% of people who reported substance abuse disorder within the past year. In 2018 an astonishing 28.5% of Native Americans reported drug abuse within the past year, compared to the national population at 19.4% drug abuse within the past year. Some tribes have taken the initiative and conducted research within their own populations to track the changes in opioid use and addiction. With financial support from the CDC and the National Institute of Health, the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board published findings on the rates of NAS throughout Oregon. The study found that between 2010 and 2017, the rate of being diagnosed with NAS was 1.6 times higher for American Indian and Alaska Native infants than Non-Hispanic White infants. Not only did the study find a discrepancy of NAS rates by race, but it also found an increase in the overall rate of NAS diagnoses. In 2010, the rate of AI/AN newborns diagnosed with NAS was 6.7 per 1,000 live births. By 2017, that rate had increased by 153%, with 17.0 per 1,000 live births of AI/AN newborns diagnosed with NAS. The Blackfeet Reservation of Montana has seen particularly alarming rates of substance abuse in recent years. A study conducted by the Blackfeet Tribal Health Department found that 44% of pregnant women who were tested for illicit substances tested positive for opioid use, with 32% of infants delivered in the Blackfeet Community Hospital showing signs of NAS during their stay. The tribe also found that 35% of women tested for illicit substances at delivery tested positive for methamphetamine. Substance abuse was identified by the Blackfeet community as the biggest problem on the reservation. A 2018 study conducted in Tennessee found that children with NAS were significantly more likely to be referred for a disability evaluation, with 19.3% of NAS children referred and 13.7% non-NAS children referred.

Collecting this data is often justified as a more secure means of identification and authentication. For example, many smartphones use fingerprint scanning or facial recognition to safeguard against unauthorized access. These safeguards are adequate but have been compromised in the past.  While biometric data is complicated to forge, it is not impossible to hack. In 2019 a team of researchers showed that they could lift fingerprints from a glass and use those fingerprints to unlock the owner’s cell phone in a process that took under 20 minutes. This unique personal data presents a challenge when compromised.   As the prevalence of biometric information grows, the stakes increase, making securing biometric data of primary importance. The United States does not have  a federal law governing the capture, storage, or processing of biometric data.  This piece will discuss the advantages of using biometric data, how your biometrics may be collected, and the opportunities and risks these technologies present. Although it is on the rise, the inherent difficulty in imitating biometric data makes it an appealing option to replace current identification, authentication, and access control methods. Another being the timesaving advantage of using biometric identification systems. We will explore the proliferation of biometric data being used in the workplace and by government agencies.   Biometrics in the workforce  The use of biometrics in the workplace for identification and authentication has been around for some time. The first palm print analysis and iris scans were used for physical access security in the late 1980s. For the 1996 Olympics, palm readers controlled access to the Olympic village. Today, fingerprint readers are widely commercially available and often used for two-factor authentication when accessing computer systems.

    "content": "This week, Senate Democrats introduced a new, narrower election reform bill following the stalling of S.1, the For the People Act back in June. The For the People Act was a broad democracy reform bill encompassing election administration, voting rights, redistricting, campaign finance and advertising, and government ethics, among other topics. This new bill, the Freedom to Vote Act (FTVA), is the product of negotiations among Senate Democrats, with the aim of securing bipartisan agreement on improvements to our election system.  The FTVA addresses a distinctly narrower set of issues than the wide sweeping For the People Act, but what remains from the previous bill is largely similar. The FTVA also includes critical new provisions that were conspicuously missing in previous bills. Even with the progress of these changes, the bill is unlikely to garner bipartisan agreement given how little it reflects Republican priorities on these issues.  What’s Out  Ethics: Drops the division pertaining to ethics, which many Republicans viewed solely as a targeted response to former President Trump’s campaigns and administration.   Campaign finance: Scales back campaign finance related sections, such as the federal small donor matching system for congressional elections, though same remain, including related to increasing campaign finance disclosures, which has been opposed by Republicans in the past.  What’s New  Funding: FTVA authorizes funding for election administration, including $3 billion for automatic voter registration. It also proposes a state election innovation fund drawing from federal criminal and civil penalty sources. Still, the amounts authorized are likely not sufficient assistance for implementation of all the bill’s new requirements.  Protections for Election Workers: In response to the rapid rise in threats to election officials and workers surrounding the 2020 election, FTVA would criminalize such harassment and threats. It would also create a path in federal court to challenge the removal of local election officials, though, this is likely to be opposed by Republicans who oppose increased federal involvement in elections.  What We’re Watching  Bipartisan agreement requires that Democrats, who have negotiated this agreement among themselves, accommodate real Republican priorities on voting reform, not just things Republicans may accept. These are the key ones we think will need to shift:  Voter ID: FTVA establishes an expansive list of permissible IDs that states may require of voters and guarantees eligible voters who do not have their ID an opportunity to vote through a provisional ballot. The provisional ballot may be checked against their signature on record, or the voter may opt to later return with appropriate identification. Minimum ID standards across the states paired with expanded voting opportunities expansion creates space for compromise.  Voter registration: The new bill requires states to implement “front end” automatic voter registration, which builds on the current Motor Voter Law by requiring individuals to opt out of registering rather than being asked to opt in when transacting with these agencies. BPC’s Task Force on Elections has endorsed a similar approach, which will yield more accurate voter rolls and improve security.   List maintenance: In addition to better voter registration, compromise and good election administration requires that administrators can keep the lists clean. FTVA instead creates stricter criteria for states to clean up their voter rolls, preventing some practices Democrats believe are meant to purge eligible voters, particularly minorities. Republicans see robust list maintenance as key to integrity. BPC believes list maintenance can achieve integrity and&hellip;",

    "content": "Despite their incredible ability to drive innovation, automate mundane tasks, and potentially improve the accuracy of numerous decision-making processes, AI systems can also reinforce social biases on an unprecedented scale. To ensure that AI-driven driven systems flourish without jeopardizing core American values, any AI-focused legislation should consider how bias comes about and what technical and social solutions have been proposed to mitigate harm without unduly hampering innovation.  How does bias occur in the first place?  As demonstrated in our first two posts in this series, (ML explainer) and (Deep learning explainer), all machine learning tools are created using training data. While unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning can unintentionally lead to unfair outcomes depending on their implementation, most documented AI bias cases are attributed to supervised learning.   In a supervised learning task, an analyst attempts to predict a particular variable of interest using a collection of features about a set of observations. Consider a hiring tool that attempts to automate the video interview process. Such a tool prompts an applicant with the questions that an interviewer would typically ask – “how do you address conflict in the workplace,” for example – and generates an ‘employability’ metric for that applicant. For example – and generates an ‘employability’ metric for that applicant.   To determine a candidate’s employability, the tool needs examples of interviews for similar jobs and the result of those interviews – whether the person was hired or not. Then, using additional tools (some of which will be introduced in later AI case studies), features of these interviews are extracted. Some of these features might include tone of voice, facial expression, and the actual responses given to each question. These features, as well as the outcome of whether a candidate was hired or not, allow the algorithm to be trained to predict employability and generate a score for any applicant in the future.    There are a few ways that this sort of model might produce bias results:  Error in feature generation. The hiring tool might not be as effective at extracting features from some interviews when compared to others. For example, an applicant with a regional dialect might have some of their words misinterpreted by the algorithm, leading to some of their responses losing their original meaning. Similarly, an applicant with facial hair might have their facial expressions obscured or misinterpreted. In this case, depending on the feature, this may introduce noise into the candidate’s employability. Non-representative training data. The interviews used to train the model might over-represent a particular skin color, accent, or regional dialect. Even if the actual words said by the applicant were perfectly captured, if every successful applicant refers to their carbonated drinks as a coke, a potential applicant referring to it as a pop or a soda might be considered less favorably by the model.  Biased social contexts. The examples of successful interviews used to train the model on what a ‘good’ candidate looks like may not represent the entire population of applicants. Whether or not this is the result of affinity bias on behalf of the employer or a broader social context where a particular demographic group is hired more frequently for a specific job, the model may pick up on these demographic indicators and give applicants a bonus or demerit depending on whether they look like successful applicants of the past.   Dangers of ‘online’ systems  In a vacuum, these models may do little more than codify historical&hellip;",

    "content": "When lawmakers enacted the paid family and sick leave tax credit in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), they intended it to be a critical resource for employees at small- and medium-size businesses balancing work with personal health and family caregiving responsibilities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent BPC polling emphasizes the need for such a resource, showing that over a third of unemployed adults would be more likely to return to work sooner if their employer offered paid family leave (PFL)—and that only 21% of Americans have access to such leave. With FFCRA’s tax credit now scheduled to expire at the end of September, it is important to consider the factors impacting the reach of the program as policymakers consider permanent paid leave policies.  Background   FFCRA, enacted in March 2020, provides a fully refundable tax credit to employers with fewer than 500 employees who provide paid leave to workers for qualifying reasons related to COVID-19 (as well as self-employed workers taking such leave). In particular, the following types of leave are eligible for the credit:   Two weeks (80 hours) of paid leave, at 100% of the employee’s regular wages, for an employee unable to work due to COVID-19-related illness or quarantine.  Between two and 12 weeks of paid leave, at two-thirds of the employee’s regular wages (or, if higher, the applicable minimum wage), for an employee providing care to someone for reasons related to COVID-19 or who is without adequate childcare due to the pandemic.  Employers with between 50 and 500 workers were required to provide such leave through 2020, but subsequent legislation extended the tax credit for companies providing qualifying leave even after the mandate ended.  Take-Up Lower than Expected  While Congress hoped that the paid leave tax credit would be a critical resource to working families, recent data suggest it has been underutilized during the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office originally estimated the FFCRA paid leave tax credit would cost the government $105 billion in total.  (That estimate was increased to $113 billion following three extensions of the credit.) As illustrated below, however, IRS data indicate employers claimed only $6.7 billion of the tax credit through the first quarter of 2021—just 6% of the initial estimate.  Moreover, a March 2021 report published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted that only a small portion of eligible businesses claimed the paid leave tax credit in 2020. The GAO reports that 382,727 employers claimed the tax credit in the second and third quarters of 2020, accounting for 3.8% of establishments with fewer than 500 workers in 2020. What Accounts for Low Uptake?  A number of factors may be contributing to the gap between expected and actual use of the FFCRA paid leave tax credit, and lawmakers should consider and address each of them as they develop a new national program.  Mandate exemptions  The Department of Labor’s decision to exempt employers with fewer than 50 workers from FFCRA’s paid leave mandate meant that the vast majority of small firms were not required to provide paid leave in 2020—and were therefore less likely to use the paid leave tax credit. Last year, employers with fewer than 50 workers employed 63% of workers in establishments with fewer than 500 employees. Interactions with other COVID-19 emergency programs  CBO highlighted that the tax credit’s interaction with other emergency programs—namely the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and unemployment insurance (UI)—likely depressed take-up. Businesses and workers largely had to choose between the paid leave tax credits and PPP or and UI, with the latter two typically providing more generous support.  The tension between FFCRA and PPP is straightforward—businesses are not allowed to claim FFCRA credits for wages paid with a PPP-forgiven loan. With 76% of businesses with fewer than 500 employees having received a PPP loan, this likely significantly reduced the number of employers able to&hellip;",

    "content": "We’re in the middle of National Small Business Week &#8211; but small businesses are scared. They are increasingly “cautious” according to the latest Small Business Index (SBI) produced by MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They are “more pessimistic” than just a few months ago in the most recent Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices survey findings. In just the past month, a growing share of small businesses reported weekly declines in revenues and employment—and four in 10 say they expect recovery to take more than six months. That’s the least optimistic outlook since March in the Census Bureau’s Small Business Pulse Survey. The reasons for the dimming outlook are not hard to discern. The Delta variant’s surge has led to re-imposition of some restrictions and a dip in consumer confidence. Inflation is now more reality than specter: three-quarters of SBI respondents said rising prices have had a “significant impact” on them this year. A higher share, 84%, cite operating cost increases in the Goldman Sachs 10KSB Voices survey. Higher inflation is partly a consequence of supply chain disruptions and delays. Anyone who might be contemplating a home renovation in the near future knows that shipping estimates for many supplies have slid from 4-6 weeks to 8-12 weeks. The same goes for Americans considering a new car purchase. The Census Pulse survey, too, has tracked a steady rise in the percentage of small businesses experiencing domestic supplier delays. Compounding these squeezes are workforce challenges. Every single small business survey released in the past two months is consistent in finding that small businesses want to hire but are encountering difficulty in finding workers. A local restaurant near me recently halted its mobile-ordering service and reduced its hours, citing staff shortages for both. The more difficult task is in determining what the Federal government could or should do to address continuing small business challenges. House Democrats, in their proposed provisions for the Build Back Better Act, have outlined several new actions. The most prominent is probably the creation of a new direct loan product, to the tune of $4.5 billion, under the current 7(a) lending support program. Additional money would also be appropriated to new direct lending under the 504/CDC program and for a new Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, both with a focus on small businesses in “underserved markets.” If adopted by Congress, these ideas would seem to have support from small businesses. In the 10KSB Voices survey, nine out of ten small business respondents endorse further action by government to expand access to capital. State and local governments are permitted to use American Rescue Plan funds for addressing “economic harms” to small businesses. The Nowak Metro Finance Lab has been at the fore of outlining ways that state and local governments can design such efforts. In a report released two months ago, BPC pointed to a dozen pieces of bipartisan legislation that have been introduced in the 117th Congress aimed at helping expand small business access to capital.&hellip;",

    "content": "Right now, there are fewer than 10,000 tons of Direct Air Capture (DAC) capacity across the globe. This is just a drop in the bucket compared to where we need to be in 2030. There is a pressing need to bring down the costs of capturing CO2, and robust federal funding for regional DAC hubs is a great way to create economies of scale, promote development from shared infrastructure, and foster innovation through learning-by-doing. The bipartisan infrastructure package, which passed the Senate as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) with 69 votes, includes many important infrastructure-related investments that were outlined in the first and second posts of this blog series. One noteworthy provision is the inclusion of $3.5 billion over the next 5 years to establish 4 regional DAC hubs. Each hub will have the capacity to capture at least 1 million metric tons of CO2 each year and the necessary infrastructure to transport and either sequester or utilize the captured CO2. The exact locations for the 4 regional DAC hubs have not yet been announced, but there are several qualities that make the “hubs” model an attractive policy design for deployment. First, shared knowledge. There are only a handful of commercial DAC companies in the world and a few hundred people with the technical knowledge required to design and run a DAC facility. By definition, a DAC hub will amalgamate some of the foremost experts on the subject to increase deployment and improve the technology. The Department of Energy already utilizes the hub model for its 5 Energy Innovation Hubs, and the Apollo Missions, the Manhattan Project, and Bell Laboratories provide historical examples of when innovation hubs led to massive technological advances. Bell Laboratories was designed to encourage interaction between scientists from different disciplines with the aim of converting shared knowledge into innovation. The same approach applies to regional DAC hubs, which can promote innovation through collaboration from leading scientists. Second, shared infrastructure. Capturing CO2 is only part of the battle; a regional DAC hub must also have the transportation infrastructure to connect sources of CO2 to either geological storage sites or facilities that utilize CO2. Currently, there are around 4,500 miles of CO2 pipelines in the United States, and most of them are located near oil fields where CO2 is used for Enhanced Oil Recovery. The IIJA takes a holistic approach that focuses on building a CO2 ecosystem with capture, transportation, sequestration, and utilization infrastructure. These activities are inherently interrelated, so building more DAC capacity will also provide economies of scale and learning-by-doing for downstream activities. Third, economic development. The supply chains for building commercial DAC plants are still quite nascent, and the quick scale up to over 4 million tons of annual DAC capacity will stimulate mass manufacturing of the necessary materials and encourage fast innovation cycles. The bipartisan package prioritizes projects that maximize scalability, geographic diversity, and long-term employment opportunities. Importantly, it stresses the need to build at least 2 DAC hubs in fossil fuel&hellip;",

Our “big reads” feature two studies about faculty expression chilled by campus pressures. UI Walks Back Policy Barring Instructors from Discussing Masks Rylee Wilson | The Daily Iowan | August 17, 2021 “The University of Iowa has altered some of its previous guidance for faculty regarding COVID-19, including a policy that barred instructors from discussing mask-wearing with their class unless it was directly relevant to the curriculum. ‘You may also have discussions or make statements regarding mask usage as long as all sides have a voice in the conversation,’ the new guidance states.” The updated Fall 2021 Q&#038;A for instructors “includes new recommendations for statements regarding masks that professors may include on a syllabus, including sharing their personal reasons for choosing to wear a mask.” The original guidance raised concerns that it infringed on academic freedom. Student Journalists Wrote About Allegations Against a Professor. Then the Articles Disappeared. Nell Gluckman | The Chronicle of Higher Education | August 17, 2021 Tarleton University directed the Texas News Service, a student newspaper, to remove articles from its website mentioning a former Tarleton professor after a lawyer representing him sent a letter accusing the paper of defamation. The publication had accurately reported in 2018 on complaints about the then-faculty member to the university’s Title IX office.

The hearing, understandably, is meant to be celebratory—small businesses and their owners and employees have been through the ringer over the last 18 months. It is entirely correct to use National Small Business Week as a moment to pause and applaud the companies that employ half of the American workforce. Yet the hearing is also a good chance for substantive questions to be raised. The House Small Business Committee has released its reconciliation provisions and the Small Business Administration last week announced new actions to further support small businesses. Congress and the Biden Administration are far from finished in their quest to help small businesses recovery. Members of the Committee should take this opportunity to ask the small businesses about their struggles and opportunities and what else public policy can do to support them. And the small businesses serving as hearing witnesses should ask questions of the Committee Members. Here are our suggestions for what questions might be asked of the small businesses at tomorrow’s hearing—and what questions might be posed to Members themselves.",

    "content": "The U.S. Senate recently notched a massive win. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) caps off several weeks of building anticipation about the ability for Congress to act on a bipartisan infrastructure deal that included clean energy innovation. Among the many infrastructure-related investments outlined in the first post of this blog series, the IIJA includes $18.9 billion in funding for carbon management infrastructure. This is a significant investment in next generation carbon management that will not only reduce emissions but also create job growth and set the U.S. as a global leader in innovation. As some members of the BPC Energy team spelled out in a recent Electricity journal publication, carbon management is a catch-all term for the portfolio of technologies, applications, and infrastructure required to reverse and manage the flow of carbon into the atmosphere that continues to drive a changing climate. The IIJA funds a wide range of carbon management infrastructure to this end, including $7.1 billion for carbon capture and removal equipment deployment, $2.2 billion for carbon transport, and $2.9 billion for carbon storage and use. Transitioning from a society that relies on carbon-emitting energy and resources to one that is net-zero, or even net-negative on an annual basis, is an ambitious vision and requires standing up an industrial-scale enterprise to accelerate carbon removal. The IPCC report unveiled in August further underscores the imperative for reaching net-zero by mid-century and the opportunity to use carbon dioxide removal, at scale. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) solutions—including engineered solutions like direct air capture (DAC) and (high quality) natural solutions provided by farms and forests—need to be scaled to the gigaton level by 2050. Each CDR approach has unique challenges that the federal government must help address, but central to these challenges is the need to stand up all components of a carbon managed economy at the same time. The programs and dedicated investments in the IIJA represent a sea change in the federal government approach to carbon management for a net-zero future. Figure 1: Breakdown of the $18.9 billion spent on carbon management in the IIJA. Selected major nature-based carbon management solutions are included but are hard to directly compare to other forms of carbon management because they include multiple program and activities and provide both carbon and non-carbon benefits. Engineered capture and removal of carbon dioxide make up the largest share of the IIJA’s spending for carbon management – representing 58% of the spending in Figure 1. More than half of this funding is focused on the deployment of DAC, a critical technology that needs to be demonstrated at the commercial scale in the coming decade to drive down costs and create a track record of results that can lower risks and spur future investments. The IIJA directly funds engineered capture and DAC in two ways. First, the bill appropriates full five-year funding for several authorizations included in last year’s Energy Act of 2020, including a DAC technology prize and a new carbon capture technology program, tasked with&hellip;",

    "content": "One year ago, five organizations “of international significance” came together to try to bring some coherence to the confusing world of disclosure standards for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities and investments. Two key challenges around ESG disclosure in company boardrooms, among asset managers, and for policymakers are definition and measurement. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to move forward with rulemaking this year and next on mandatory disclosure for climate impact, human capital management, and board diversity. The European Union is already farther down the road, having issued a number of rules and directives seeking to standardize ESG investment. In a recent Financial Times story ($) about “greenwashing” allegations at a German asset manager, some striking observations were made: Portfolio manager: “The definition of what ESG or responsible investment truly is, has been up for debate ever since it was created.” Industry executive: “Data quality is really bad. It’s like trying to invest with data from the 1980s.” In a 2020 investor survey by BlackRock, “poor quality/availability of data and analytics” was rated as the top obstacle to ESG investing. In another FT story, an executive from BPC’s ESG partner S&#038;P Global pointed out, “What’s happening at the moment, in terms of the need to develop more comprehensive and standardized disclosures, is the mother of all battles.” This is why those five organizations came together in September 2020, to “resolve this confusion and to show a commitment to working towards a comprehensive corporate reporting system.” The five organizations are the leading framework- and standard-setters in this area. We were fortunate to have two of those organizations—the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB, now the Value Reporting Foundation)—participate in a June event, “Disclosure Standards and Frameworks: What’s it all Mean for Stakeholders?” Additional participants represented the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Below are insights from the event that help shed light on this “mother of all battles” over ESG disclosure standards.",

    "content": "Technology has accelerated the ability to communicate, transport goods and information, and modernize marketplaces. Rapid growth and development in the technology sector has pushed many tech companies to become some of the largest in the world. In early 2021, the five largest companies in the United States by market value – Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft – had a combined value of over $8 trillion and operated globally.1 Apple, for instance, has a market value of $2.25 trillion, providing services in 175 countries and regions around the world. While U.S. regulators respond to growing antitrust concerns related to many large technology companies, they should be mindful of how competition policy might influence America’s position as a global competitor. These U.S. companies, despite their size, are not operating entirely without international rivals. In many ways, China’s tech sector compares to that of the U.S. For instance, two of the most valued companies in China – Tencent, a social networking company, and Alibaba, an eCommerce and cloud computing company – are tech giants comparable to U.S. companies with high market values exceeding $770 billion and $650 billion, respectively. Other counterparts in China and abroad are also large and compete internationally. We created the following comparison chart to better show how large U.S. tech companies compete with international ones. In figure 1, we listed the five highest valued U.S. companies in order of their market values, then matched them with Chinese and other foreign counterparts that most resembled their business models and profiles. In the following chart (figure 2), we compare the market values of each company listed above. As you can see, the five American companies lead over their direct competitors in terms of market value. Though their size today is apparent, technology companies have not always had a significant presence in the global economy. The following graphic (figure 3) shows the market values of the top ten firms, including non-tech firms, over the last decade. Over time, more technology firms (American in blue and Chinese in red) start to replace other large firms (in grey) from industries such as finance and energy. For example, in 2011, the only tech companies in the top ten were Apple and Microsoft. Five years later, all American companies listed above are valued in the top ten most valuable companies. By 2021, Tencent and Alibaba, two Chinese tech firms, also entered this ranking. The size of these American technology companies has grown over the last decade, but so too has their competition abroad. China, in particular, has multiple companies similar to U.S. ones that are also large in market value. Policymakers’ bid for reforming competition policy will affect how U.S. technology companies interact with foreign ones in the global economy. Regulation can greatly influence global competition and national security issues like data security, cybersecurity, and innovation, so when evaluating competition policy, U.S. policymakers should be mindful of the global nature of these markets. 1 This blog uses Forbes Global 2000 market value data to compare companies in various&hellip;",

    "content": "Labor Day came with a shock to the labor market this year, as emergency unemployment insurance (UI) programs first enacted as part of the CARES Act in spring 2020 expired this week. Instead of pursuing a federal extension of the programs, the Biden administration gave states the option to continue providing extra support for their unemployed populations by allowing them to tap into the $350 billion in state aid allocated by the American Rescue Plan. Now, states must strike a balance between supporting those still affected by the public health crisis and getting Americans back into the workforce. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted five separate UI expansions, the most substantial of which included: Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), which provided a $300 supplement (originally $600) to regular unemployment benefits Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), which added 53 weeks (originally 13) to UI eligibility Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which extended unemployment benefits to many Americans not eligible for regular UI, such as gig economy workers After extensions in December 2020 and March 2021, these programs expired on September 6, though nearly half of states had already discontinued some or all of their UI expansions earlier this summer. By some estimates, the expiration likely led to around 7.5 million Americans completely losing UI benefits and an additional 3 million losing the $300 supplement, and will lead to a drop in spending of around $8 billion in September and October. In an effort to provide flexibility to states, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Department of Labor Secretary Marty Walsh recently announced that states could use unspent money from the $350 billion in state and local government aid allocated by the American Rescue Plan to continue providing expanded UI benefits. Now, states must decide whether to extend these expansions, weighing the ever-changing economic and public health conditions. Currently, however, no state has announced plans to continue emergency UI programs. Experts and policymakers continue to fiercely debate whether the supplemental $300 provided by FPUC discouraged Americans from returning to work. While regular UI benefits are relatively modest and designed to only provide a temporary bridge between the previous job and the next, the flat supplement provided by FPUC resulted in nearly half of jobless workers collecting at least as much in unemployment compensation as their prior wages. Although the simplicity of a flat UI supplement helped get crucial financial support quickly into the bank accounts of American households early in the pandemic, FPUC’s disparate impact across states due to regional wage variation and state UI program differences suggests that the program was poorly targeted. In addition, despite tepid job growth in August, the ongoing labor market recovery has progressed significantly in recent months, calling into question whether the supplement is still needed. The unemployment rate is now 5.2%, and monthly job growth has averaged 586,000 since the beginning of the year. Between June and July, unemployment fell or remained stable in every state, and in the last full week of August, initial&hellip;",

    "content": "Skeptics said it couldn’t be done. That bipartisanship in the Senate on major legislation, especially dealing with ambitious clean energy investments and ambitious infrastructure policy, was no longer possible. Yet Senate passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act showed that, framed in the right way, climate-targeted, long-term, clean energy investments can garner bipartisan support. The bill passed on August 10 by the wide margin of 69-30, with 19 Republican Senators in support. Here at Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), we believe the package, and its successful navigation through the Senate, represents a major step forward in the policy agenda for climate and clean energy. While it doesn’t have all the pieces needed for a comprehensive federal climate solution, the IIJA contains some of the most important clean energy investments in US history, as Senators from both parties have noted. The BPC has been focused for more than a decade on the bipartisan, technically grounded policy and political pathway for climate-focused energy policies. The success of the IIJA (and the Energy Policy Act of 2020 before that) represents a strong signal that this strategy can work. We’re proud to have played a role – along with many of our peers in the stakeholder community – in helping to shape the outcome of this package. Specific BPC Energy Program initiatives that made it into the IIJA include improved federal permitting provisions and funding for major commercial demonstration projects, carbon capture and removal, ports and offshore wind, a modern power grid, and other clean power and transportation infrastructure. Here is a brief summary of BPC recommendations reflected in the IIJA: BPC’s Smarter, Cleaner, Faster Infrastructure Task Force was organized around the premise that achieving our nation’s climate goals requires an ability to site, permit, and build infrastructure at a fundamentally faster pace. Eight specific Task Force recommendations are in the bill, including those improving scoping, siting, and investing in the buildout of electricity transmission, which is crucial to the clean energy transition, and provisions streamlining infrastructure permitting. Members of the task force include Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum; Former U.S. Representative John Delaney; Former FERC Commissioner Colette Honorable; Former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal; Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro; and Charlotte, FL County Commissioner Bill Truex. For more than a decade, BPC’s American Energy Innovation Council has advocated for a renewed and enhanced federal role in energy demonstration projects. Our Scaling Innovation project is focused on exploring this issue in greater detail. The IIJA takes a major step forward here, by funding commercial demonstration projects for electricity storage, hydrogen, carbon capture, direct air capture, renewable energy, advanced nuclear energy, and other key topics. Members of AEIC include Former Chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin Norm Augustine; Former CEO and President of The Aerospace Corporation Dr. Wanda Austin; Chairman and CEO of General Atomics Neal Blue; Chair, President, and CEO of Dominion Energy Robert Blue; Founder and CEO of ClearPath Jay Faison; Chairman, President, and CEO of Southern Company Thomas A.

    "content": "It was just 20 years ago that Congress provided a blueprint for how to create federal voting legislation in a truly bipartisan manner. When the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) passed in 2002, it received 98 votes in the Senate and 356 in the House of Representatives. The bill was built on compromise; it maintained state and local control of elections while beginning to carve out space for more robust federal involvement. Each of the bill’s big-ticket policy wins were the result of careful negotiation and relied on an incentivize-based grant structure. Today, the challenges facing elections are sophisticated and deeply intertwined with virulent partisan divisions that risk undermining the heart of our democracy. Rather than capitalize on the momentum of the 2020 election to hedge a new beginning for voting in America, both parties have reverted to worn out talking points and partisan rhetoric. Congress must look back to move ahead. The path forward on election reform is clear, simple, and rooted in America’s long legacy of cooperation and progress. The path forward requires only that Congress once again put American voters first and partisanship second. The Bipartisan Policy Center has identified five pillars of pragmatic and sustainable federal election reform: 1. Bipartisanship to promote sustainable policy change and improve voter confidence. For much of the last two decades, federal election reform initiatives have been largely partisan, materializing in different ways depending on who was in control. The majority House Republicans of the 2010s waged a multi-Congress campaign to eliminate the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and minimize federal involvement in elections. When House Democrats retook the majority in 2019, they launched a renewed effort to pass voting reforms that has so far spanned two Congresses (even reserving HR1 for the effort). Like with other party priorities, congressional majorities are taking an all-or-nothing stance. As long as each side demands that no piece of election reform move forward unless all their priorities are included, change won&#8217;t happen. These federal efforts create a mirage of action for their constituents rather than effect real change. The current system now incentivizes lawmakers to propose expansive messaging bills that claim to be the solution to all of democracy’s ailments by addressing the likes of campaign finance, voting method availability, redistricting, and election security all in one fell swoop. Yet this kitchen-sink approach makes it difficult to pass any legislation, as the opposite party – and even members of the majority &#8211; can invariably find something in the all-encompassing bill to disagree with. The solution to partisanship is not more partisanship. Only one outcome is certain when a single party tries to reform democracy alone: erosion of the opposite party’s trust in our governing institutions. Thus, in order to break through the bitter divisions on elections policy, Congress build develop targeted, balanced pieces of legislation that expand access and improve security. 2. Minimum standards that enable flexibility and standardization. Election administration in the United States is highly decentralized, making a one-size-fits-all solution from the federal&hellip;",

    "content": "In recent weeks there has been great attention paid to the recall election of California Governor Gavin Newsom while the complicated issue of voting during record wildfires has been largely ignored. Fires have displaced tens of thousands of Californians from their homes, resulting in countless technical questions about how, when, and where evacuated California citizens can vote. Thanks to both the preparedness and quick response of California’s election officials, voters will still be able to exercise their right to vote this September, regardless of evacuation status. Events like the wildfires in California, hurricanes in Florida, and tornados in Tennessee during elections are somber yet important reminders of the importance of proactive and strategic emergency preparedness for elections. To best serve voters, BPC’s Task Force on Elections recommends that state and local election officials and policymakers take two key actions to prepare for the unexpected, ensure the right to vote, and protect the legitimacy of the election process: States should create emergency election procedures that include contingencies for weather, terrorism, or other disasters. Detailed emergency response plans enable quick response during an emergency. Without clear plans and chains of command in place, time that should be spent implementing and communicating changes to voters is instead spent debating over the right course of action resulting in delays and unnecessary confusion. States should require local election offices to develop emergency election procedures and submit them to the state for review and coordination. U.S. elections are highly decentralized, and while some disasters are global in nature, others are highly local. It’s critical that states work with their localities to ensure that all levels of elections are protected against emergencies. As the September 14 election nears, election officials are rapidly adjusting to ensure Californians who have been displaced or evacuated from their homes can still vote in the recall. The California Secretary of State has long-standing policies which allow counties to communicate clearly and quickly with voters. California is one of the states that is well-prepared to take on disruptive events, but getting there wasn’t necessarily quick. When a plan is in place, election officials can quickly adjust voting processes to ensure ballot access, but these voters must in turn see and understand that authoritative information. For example, the El Dorado County Elections department posted clear, timely information on Facebook that details the various methods voters can use to cast their ballot: This post illustrates the plans in place and effective emergency procedures. El Dorado County has a population of almost 200,000 people and guaranteeing all eligible voters view this information—regardless of the medium of dissemination—proves difficult. California is a strong example where emergency policies are already in place so that when disaster strikes, the focus is on information dissemination. Even though most Americans only interact with the voting process once every few years, elections take months (if not years) of logistics and preparation. When an emergency occurs, there is limited time to figure out alternative options. Lack of a plan can significantly compound the&hellip;",

    "content": "Earlier this year, the Biden administration announced that the United States would withdraw its remaining 2,500 troops from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. By early August, most of the U.S. forces had left the country. During this time, Taliban forces executed a swift and successful campaign, gaining control of the country, culminating on August 15, by taking the capital city of Kabul. As the Taliban took control, the Biden administration has scrambled to evacuate thousands of U.S. citizens, embassy staff, Afghan allies, and refugees stranded in Afghanistan through the Kabul airport without a coherent strategy or a plan of action. On August 20, BPC hosted an event with members of Congress who had served in the region. They recommended putting aside partisan rhetoric to focus on assisting Afghans who have been integral to U.S. operations in Afghanistan. The Biden administration’s evacuation process over the past two weeks has been chaotic and deadly for those trying to escape, further compounded by Thursday’s horrific terrorist attack. The evacuation effort ended on August 30, with the U.S. withdrawal, but there are still operational hurdles and challenges to processing evacuees. In 2009, Congress passed the Afghan Allies Act, which provided 7,500 Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked and served alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan. In subsequent years, Congress renewed the program in 2014, 2015, and 2016. After the Biden administration announced in April its planned military withdrawal from Afghanistan, Congress passed the Averting Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs Act of 2021 (ALLIES Act) with overwhelming bipartisan support. Since 2014, the SIV program has designated a total of 27,000 visas for Afghans, including visas for surviving spouses or children of Afghans who aided the U.S. military. Furthermore, Congress made available $1 billion for the SIV program, including $500 million for emergency transportation, housing, and other services for Afghans leaving the country. However, even as Congress took bipartisan action to alleviate the backlogs by increasing the number of SIV visas by 8,000, the program has been plagued with delays and difficulties. Currently, the backlog in the SIV visa program stands at 18,000 for principal applicants alone. When including spouses and children in that backlog, the real number of people awaiting processing could be around 80,000. Even before the need for a rapid removal of refugees and allies from Afghanistan arose, the United States faced hurdles in processing and vetting refugees. For example, SIV visa applicants already undergo an acute vetting and bureaucratic application process consisting of a lengthy, redundant, and cumbersome 14-step application process which sometimes made SIVs nearly impossible to obtain. While the SIV program only applies to those who directly worked with the U.S military, Afghans who have been involved with the U.S. government in civil occupations and other Afghans who worked for U.S.-based media or non-governmental organizations and meet certain requirements will now qualify for the Priority 2 visa designation.1 According to the International Rescue Committee, there are around 300,000 Afghan civilians who have&hellip;",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted blind spots in our UI system, which was unprepared for the tumultuous labor market and public health forces at play in 2020. As a temporary solution, lawmakers enacted Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) in March 2020, extending benefits to those not covered by regular UI. First enacted as part of the CARES Act, PUA has provided crucial financial support for millions of households. At its peak in August 2020, PUA covered 14.6 million people. After two extensions, 5 million people were still receiving benefits in August 2021. With PUA now scheduled to lapse in early September, lawmakers should consider permanently incorporating some of these workers into the UI system to better reflect the 21st century workforce. In particular, the pandemic highlighted the necessity to provide UI benefits to self-employed workers. PUA extended UI benefits to Americans who lost their job during the fallout from COVID-19 but were not covered by traditional unemployment insurance—which only provides benefits to workers who are permanently laid off by their employers through no fault of their own. In particular, PUA provides coverage to self-employed workers who lost business, those who are furloughed, and those unable to work for reasons related to COVID-19, including: contracting COVID-19, being under quarantine, caring for someone with COVID-19, and caring for a child or family member whose school or care facility is closed due to COVID-19. While PUA served as a critical safety net during the pandemic, it should not be a permanent fixture of the UI system. PUA’s provisions that respond directly to public health concerns (such as those specific to COVID-related illness and caregiving) should lapse after the pandemic ends. Although PUA’s quick passage was key to mitigating financial distress, that urgency prevented Congress from addressing potential pitfalls, and the program has likely been subject to high levels of fraud. Rather than continuing PUA indefinitely, lawmakers should look at ways to permanently expand eligibility for certain workers within the regular UI system. Millions of Americans are self-employed, working in jobs ranging from rideshare or delivery driving to plumbing to consulting for Fortune 500 companies. While data are sparse and inconsistent, official estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that there were 17 million self-employed workers in July, accounting for around 11% of all workers. In addition, over the past decade, the emergence of app-based jobs, such as driving for Uber or Lyft, has brought heightened attention to workers in the gig economy, many of whom are self-employed independent contractors. BLS found that in 2017, there were 10.6 million independent contractors in the United States, representing 6.9% of total employment. More recent evidence indicates that independent contracting could be even more prevalent today. A 2019 poll conducted by Gallup and Intuit found that 23 million workers—14.4% of the workforce—identify their primary job as independent contracting. Despite their&hellip;",

    "content": "Corporate disclosure is gaining much more attention in Washington. This coming October, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to announce rulemaking on climate disclosure, with board diversity and human capital soon to follow. On Capitol Hill, a recent package adopted in the House included sweeping changes in many areas of corporate governance. Here, we take a close look at this bill as it offers a glimpse of where the partisan fault lines might be for regulatory and legislative action in the future. In March 2021, the SEC issued a request for public comment evaluating mandatory standards and disclosure framework on ESG issues. The SEC is expected to soon undertake a rulemaking in the autumn of 2021. While the SEC is an independent commission, it is currently divided 3-2 along party lines including President Biden’s pick for Chairman, Gary Gensler. Congress is also looking at SEC disclosure issues. In June, by a 215-214 vote, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1187 The Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act of 2021 (&#8220;Disclosure Act&#8221;) with no Republican votes and all but 4 Democratic votes. The original H.R. 1187, the ESG Disclosure and Simplification Act, was used as the vehicle for several bills on disclosure. The Disclosure Act was a response to the growing interest in “what” material information companies disclose and “how” they disclose that information to the SEC. These issues were the subject of a candid conversation with Reps. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) and Bill Huizenga (R-MI) hosted by BPC in June. BPC Disclosure Event As Congressman Meeks (D-NY) indicated, the Disclosure Act is a means to fill the gaps left unresolved by market forces. However, he acknowledged that this was a messaging bill and that the legislation will need to be refined through the legislative process. It can be surmised that opponents of the bill were concerned with the breadth of ESG disclosure issues addressed in it. Congressman Huizenga (R-MI) indicated that Congress is asking the SEC to weigh in on social and political issues that are better debated in the halls of Congress rather than at an independent agency. Both Congressmen agreed that ESG disclosure will continue to expand for the foreseeable future. They also both support the SEC’s tripartite mission to “protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.” The Disclosure Act (“Act”) would require the SEC to mandate ESG disclosure and develop the metrics for such disclosure. It specifically requires disclosing information on political expenditures; pay ratios of certain employees; climate risk; tax havens; workforce demographics; workplace harassment; cyber security; board diversity; and forced labor. Proponents of the legislation argue investors need more ESG information to make sound investment decisions. Opponents, however, argue that under the existing materiality standard the types of information listed in the Act are already required to be disclosed if the information is material to a reasonable investor. Congress found that the SEC has the authority to require the disclosure of ESG information that is material or in&hellip;",

A CES is a sectoral approach to decarbonizing the power sector that requires increasing amounts of qualifying clean energy sources over a certain time period. By creating a market for clean energy credits, a CES drives the transition towards cleaner sources of electricity. On April 21, 2021, the United States government set its “nationally determined contribution” (or NDC) under the Paris Agreement. The NDC establishes an economy-wide target of reducing U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In developing the NDC, the United States considered sector-by-sector emissions reduction pathways and has set a goal to reach 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. A national CES is a key policy mechanism to achieve electricity emissions reductions. Although the concept of a national CES is built upon similar policies successfully implemented at the state level, there are a set of key policy design decisions that must be made when developing a federal CES. There have been several legislative proposals introduced in the 116th and 117th Congresses that have included a CES, and the table below compares select design choices in these bills. 235",

    "content": "From the earliest days of COVID-19 there has been an ongoing debate about the benefits of travel restrictions in reducing the spread of the disease. The Trump administration instituted multiple different restrictions, many of which have been continued by the Biden administration. Most notable among those is the border restriction on “non-essential” travel. However, as restrictions have shifted and administrations have changed, it has become harder to keep track of the “travel ban jungle” and the COVID-related restrictions that have affected visa-holders and travelers to and from the United States during the pandemic. On January 31, 2020, former President Donald Trump issued a presidential proclamation banning travel from China to the United States. This marked the beginning of the administration’s effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 by means of implementing extensive immigration and visa restriction policies. By the end of May 2020, the Trump administration had issued travel bans to and from China, Iran, the Schengen Area of Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Brazil. Although termed “bans” they are not total and there are many exceptions. Overall, these proclamations restrict the entry of immigrants or non-immigrants who have been physically present in these geographic areas in the preceding 14 days from entering the country, unless exempted or otherwise excepted. The exceptions include: U.S. citizens Non-citizen nationals of the United States Lawful permanent residents of the United States Noncitizen spouses of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident And multiple other categories. In March 2020, the U.S. government began rolling out numerous additional pandemic-related travel and visa restrictions. On March 18, President Trump indefinitely paused all refugee resettlement to the U.S. and suspended all routine immigrant and nonimmigrant visa appointments, effectively pausing almost all legal immigration to the United States. Both refugee resettlement and visa appointments resumed in July 2020 (resettlement resumed in full, and visa appointments were to be phased in), but not before receiving backlash from refugee advocates. On March 23, Trump restricted all nonessential travel on the northern and southern land borders. Also in March 2020, the Trump administration ordered the implementation of the so-called Title 42 order by the Centers for Disease Control under the Public Health Safety Act, which allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to expel any migrant to the last country of transit or origin “when doing so is required in the interest of the public health.” By April 2020, Title 42 expulsions had already accounted for 90% of all border encounters, which some interpreted as the Trump administration using COVID-19 as a guise for continuing its border deterrence efforts. Initially, the Trump administration applied Title 42 expulsions to all types of migrants—including unaccompanied children—at the border, which was met with significant disapproval from advocates. However, in November 2020, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled that the Trump administration did not have the authority to expel unaccompanied children on these public health grounds.

    "content": "By enacting a temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) as part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), lawmakers took a major step towards introducing a permanent child allowance. Indeed, just last month, the IRS began issuing monthly payments to most households with children. Those regular payments, however, will stop at the end of 2021, when the ARP provision expires. With bipartisan interest growing around the concept of a child allowance, lawmakers should adopt a durable and permanent child allowance plan while addressing the implications for workers and federal fiscal policy. Background  First, the basics. A child allowance provides a flat, periodic per-child cash benefit, with the goal of helping families offset the costs of raising children throughout the year. In its simplest form, a child allowance would go to all families regardless of income so that those with no earnings receive the same monthly per-child check as those with the highest earnings. In practice, however, policymakers in countries that have adopted child allowances tend to provide the full benefit for families with no income while phasing it out for families further up the income distribution. Many iterations of a child allowance in other countries provide a larger benefit for young children, recognizing that parents of young children often face significant child-related costs while earning less income than parents of older children. This year, legislative momentum toward adopting a child allowance progressed as Democrats passed the ARP along party lines, effectively transforming the CTC into a child allowance for 2021. In particular, the ARP made the CTC fully refundable so that families without federal income tax liability can receive the full credit, eliminated the credit phase-in so families without any earnings can receive the maximum benefit, and directed the IRS to pay benefits periodically. The ARP also increased the maximum CTC from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under age 6 and to $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17.1 On the Republican side, the Family Security Act, proposed by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), would transform the CTC altogether with a monthly child allowance administered by the Social Security Administration. Romney’s plan would provide $4,200 per year ($350 per month) for children under 6 and $3,000 per year ($250 per month) for those between ages 6 and 17. If families have multiple children, the total household child allowance benefits would be capped at $15,000 per year ($1,250 per month). This effectively caps a family’s benefit to four or five children, depending on age. Romney’s plan would fund the new child allowance, in part, by scaling back other portions of the social safety net. Specifically, it would reduce the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and eliminate the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, among other changes. Both the ARP and Romney’s proposal would phase out the child allowance for higher-income families. Policy Considerations The permanent adoption of a child allowance would have significant implications for poverty, work, and the federal budget. Child Poverty&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical need for federal investment in housing and economic development to stabilize vulnerable populations and promote equity. However, the system that policymakers currently use to distribute that investment is built around flawed area median income (AMI) calculations, which often disadvantage low-income Americans in rural areas that suffer from high concentrations of poverty—including Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the Colonias, and tribal lands. Ironically, under the current system, the overall poverty of a community has become an obstacle for many needy families accessing federal anti-poverty programs.  Here’s how the system works: Access to most federal anti-poverty programs, including those to support affordable housing and community development, is based on whether a household qualifies as “low income,” “very low income,” or “extremely low income.” Whether a household falls into one of these categories is determined by reference to the incomes of that household’s immediate neighbors—their AMI. A low-income household, for example, is one with an income of 80% or lower than the area median—adjusted for household size. Two households with exactly the same income could be treated differently for program eligibility purposes depending on where they live and the incomes of their neighbors.  &nbsp; The Skewing Effect of AMI Calculations  This skewing effect is displayed when comparing the treatment of urban and rural households. In urban areas, 30.4% of the population qualifies as “low income,” whereas only 16.3% of the population qualifies in rural areas. A major cause of this disparity is that cities typically have relatively affluent residents who make their lower-income neighbors appear worse off by comparison. However, rural parts of the country tend to have higher overall levels of poverty, thereby skewing the AMI calculation.  Of course, a family residing in a rural community who may not qualify as “low income” is no less worthy of federal assistance than a family with the same income who does qualify by virtue of living in a city with comparably higher-income residents. Determining eligibility for anti-poverty relief solely on the basis of income comparisons among neighbors fails to accurately assess economic well-being and need.    Congress recognized this problem when it created the Homeowner Assistance Fund, which aims to help pandemic-impacted households catch up on mortgage and utility bills. Instead of determining eligibility for relief under the program solely using the typical AMI calculations, Congress directed that the majority of Homeowner Assistance Fund monies be targeted to households making less than 100% of the national median income of $78,500. However, while maintaining this targeting requirement in the program’s initial regulations, the Treasury Department limited access to the program to homeowners making less than or equal to 150% of the local AMI. For nearly 600 counties across 17 states, that 150% threshold was actually below the national media income of $78,500. In effect, Treasury’s reliance on AMI over national median income made families that Congress intended to be a priority, ineligible for the program.  In early August, the Treasury Department walked back this decision, and changed the maximum eligibility level for the Homeowners Assistance Fund to be either 150% of AMI or 100% of the national median income, whichever was greater. While this brought the regulations in line with congressional direction, it continues to perpetuate disparate access. In the impacted counties, a family must meet the priority population metrics to qualify for assistance. In every other community in the nation however, families either may meet the priority population metrics or, if they have incomes too high for that, may qualify under the maximum income ceiling. For a family of four, where they live is the only determination for whether or not they can receive help to save their home.   Note: The same family, earning area averages for their professions, are eligible for HAF assistance in a thriving urban area (Montgomery Co., MD), but ineligible in an impacted rural county (Perry&hellip;",

    "content": "On August 12, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released its latest data for July showing that overall encounters at the southwest border continue to remain high. July experienced the highest monthly number of migrants detained at the southwest border in two decades. It is possible that the number of migrants apprehended this year may surpass the previous yearly record from fiscal year 2000, in which CBP apprehended 1.67 million migrants. While encounters of single adults dropped for the second month in a row, apprehensions for family units and unaccompanied children (UAC) have seen dramatic increases. This also represents a counter-cyclical trend since migration usually dips during the hot summer months at the border. Interestingly, for the first time, more migrants in CBP’s &#8220;other&#8221; nationality category arrived than from all other identified nationalities, including Mexico, demonstrating the increasingly global nature of migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. With the growing number of migrants arriving at the border, the Biden administration continues to face hurdles in managing migrant flows, including providing proper shelters for migrant children. Earlier this month, the administration announced that it would be resuming expedited removal of families who do not qualify for asylum. Additionally, this month, the administration indefinitely renewed the Trump-era policy &#8212; Title 42, citing increases in Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant. Title 42 has remained contentious among immigration experts, who attribute high migrant recidivism rates to the controversial policy. As seen in Figure 1, CBP encounters1 at the U.S- Mexico border for July continue to set record highs, surpassing high migration months from FY2019 and FY2014. In July 2021, CBP recorded a total of 199,777 arrivals, a 12% increase from June. This brings total CBP encounters for FY2021 to 1.2 million, on pace to become the highest total arrivals in 21 years. CBP data from July shows that the growth in encounters can be attributed to the continued increase in family and UAC arrivals. While the number of single adults encountered has decreased for the second month in a row, family and UAC apprehensions have increased dramatically. As shown in Figure 2, encounters for single adults decreased by 7.4% in July compared to the previous month. Additionally, in June, single adult encounters had decreased to 113,474 from 117,925 in May. However, encounters for families and UACs increased by 52% and 24.4% respectively from June to July. The 76,056 family encounters were at their highest since May 2019 when there were 84,486 encounters. UAC encounters also jumped to 18,689. The UAC encounter numbers for July are on par with arrivals from March 2021, when CBP recorded 18,719 UAC arrivals at the border. The July CBP report further reveals that the migration trend at the U.S.-Mexico border is of a global nature. The increase in migrant arrivals from “other countries” than Mexico and the Northern Triangle of Central America have risen by over 500% since FY2020. As shown in Figure 3, since February of 2021, migrants from countries other than Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras&hellip;",

    "content": "In the wake of a large settlement agreement between states and opioid distributors, states need to learn from the spending mistakes made after the Big Tobacco settlement years ago. The opioid epidemic has been raging for years, with thousands of lives lost to overdose and even more lives suffering from the impacts of addiction. In 2020, the CDC reported 93,398 people died from drug overdoses in the U.S.—roughly 30% higher than in 2019—including 69,769 of these deaths involving opioids, a 37% increase over 2019. Still, drug manufacturers, like Purdue Pharma (the maker of OxyContin) continue to deny any wrongdoing despite their introduction of highly addictive drugs and aggressive marketing which led to severe overprescribing. On July 21, 2021, a group of state attorneys general announced a $26 billion settlement agreement ($21 billion between states and several of the largest opioid distributors—McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health—and $5 billion between states and drug maker Johnson &#038; Johnson). The funding from this settlement agreement, disbursed over the course of 18 years, must be used effectively for evidence-based interventions geared primarily towards prevention and treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs) rather than general state revenue. A multi-billion-dollar settlement between Purdue Pharma and states (separate from the aforementioned $26 billion settlement) would allow the company to never admit to any wrongdoing and avoid future opioid-related lawsuits. This $26 billion settlement between the states and opioid distributors is reminiscent of the settlement with tobacco companies in 1998. In that settlement, state governments received $246 billion to restrict cigarette sales and marketing by forbidding manufacturers from targeting youth and banning specific types of media (e.g., cartoons). The settlement funds were also to be used for prevention and cessation programs. However, a 2018 retrospective assessment revealed that less than 3% of the settlement funds were used for programs to prevent kids from smoking and to help smokers quit. Particularly glaring is that no state was funding tobacco prevention at the CDC’s recommended levels at the time when the assessment was published. Smoking rates fell to an all-time low in subsequent years, but ultimately stagnated over time. The recent increased use of e-cigarettes has renewed old fears within the anti-smoking community. Much like the 1998 settlement with Big Tobacco, the opioid settlement poses similar funding allocation risks. There are already concerns among public health experts that: the settlement amount is both insufficient, it will result in non-compliance, and the transparency and accountability measures included (e.g., public reporting of funds used for purposes other than opioid remediation, and ability for distributors and states to hold each other accountable) are largely self-imposed. The settlement agreement’s primary requirement is that states use at least 85% of the settlement funds on “opioid remediation.” While this is accompanied by a non-exhaustive list of evidence-based interventions, there is extensive flexibility for states to redefine and selectively enforce their spending parameters. There is a risk that funds will be used for other state priorities, resulting in opioid remediation and health outcomes remaining stagnant or worsening. BPC’s&hellip;",

    "content": "It turns out that August is a busy month in the world of corporate governance. Two years ago today, Business Roundtable (BRT) made waves when it announced, along with over 100 company signatories, that it was committing itself to “stakeholder capitalism.” The commitment to engage stakeholders has been widely interpreted as a dedication to evaluate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in corporate decisions. Following the release, many companies argued that the statement was simply confirmation of existing practices. Others heralded it as a new age in corporate governance. Still, others pointed out that in the end, securities law places a premium on shareholder rights. Earlier this month, academic research argued that the BRT statement was “mostly for show.” Corporate promises, they found, continue to be “illusory” in terms of ESG and stakeholder interests. This was mildly corroborated by a JUST Capital survey released this August. In that survey, pluralities of respondents said that “companies have not significantly shifted their focus away from shareholders to the benefit of other stakeholders.” Yet according to the JUST Capital survey, a “more evolved form of capitalism” continues to be important for Americans. They want corporations to prioritize stakeholders alongside shareholders and disclose their environmental and social impacts. The trick is what to disclose and how to disclose, which is where certainty erodes. Also this month (told you August was busy), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (CCMC) released results of an ESG survey of companies. While the survey found that more companies have been publicly reporting on issues like climate change, it also highlighted a significant lack of clarity on these issues. Just 8% of companies in the CCMC survey said that ESG “encompasses a generally understood set of issues” and 61% said ESG is a subjective term and means something different to different sets of interested parties, whether companies, investors, or regulators. As Politico summed it up, “ESG? WHUT?” As it happens, this August falls right between the end of a comment period and the beginning of a likely rulemaking period at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Over the spring and summer, the agency received over 500 comments in response to its request for information regarding climate change disclosure. The general expectation is that the SEC will announce proposed rulemaking in October on climate change disclosure with workforce metrics soon to follow. Congress is also paying more attention to ESG and stakeholder capitalism. In June, the House of Representatives narrowly passed H.R. 1187, The Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act of 2021. While it’s unlikely to go any further, the bill sets down markers for where most Democrats would like to go with corporate governance policy. Although the bill passed along partisan lines (with four Democrats voting against), it did contain some elements that have attracted bipartisan support in the past. Congressmen Gregory Meeks (D-NY) and Bill Huizenga (R-MI) joined the Bipartisan Policy Center last month for a discussion of some of those areas of agreement.&hellip;",

Faculty Senate Passes Motion for Update in Academic Freedom Language of Faculty Handbook Grace Wu | The Daily Northwestern | July 15, 2021 Northwestern University’s Faculty Senate approved changes to its faculty handbook, including “extending academic freedom to tenure-eligible and non-tenure-eligible faculty as well as the work of faculty in publications and abroad.” Changes also include new language “granting employed instructors and researchers the right to criticize and seek revisions to University policy.” Appeals Court Sides with Christian Group Deregistered by Iowa Elizabeth Redden | Inside Higher Ed | July 19, 2021 “The U.S. Court for Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled Friday that University of Iowa administrators targeted religious organizations for discriminatory treatment and further found that administrators can be held personally liable for their actions.” The case was brought by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, an organization deregistered during a 2018 administrative review of student organizations. The court found that “reviewers involved in the ‘Student Org Clean Up Proposal’ were instructed to ‘look at religious student groups first.’” OU Coaches Say Players Can Be Disciplined Over Politics Ray Carter | Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs | July 26, 2021 A former University of Oklahoma volleyball player has sued the school and her coaches after she was disciplined for her criticism of the documentary “13th,” a film about the 13th Amendment, that the team was required to watch. Now the team’s coaches have filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing “they are allowed to discipline players for political opinions because political disagreements can disrupt team unity&#8230; that athletes waive some First Amendment free-speech rights as a condition of scholarship acceptance.’” NU President, Chancellors Oppose CRT Resolution, Uphold Academic Freedom Zach Wendling | The Daily Nebraskan | July 21, 2021 “Nearly two weeks after University of Nebraska Regent and gubernatorial candidate Jim Pillen introduced a resolution opposing critical race theory across NU, top university leaders released a unified statement defending academic freedom&#8230; In , they say they write unified ‘in defense of freedom of expression for all members of the University of Nebraska community&#8230; As our policies and practices make clear, the University of Nebraska is strongly committed to academic freedom.’” On August 13, the Nebraska Board of Regents voted down the resolution 3-5.

    "content": "On June 30, 2021, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman) released its annual report to Congress. In the report, the office outlined key developments and areas of focus for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Most interestingly, the report notes a congressional mandate for USCIS “to submit a 5-year plan to establish electronic filing procedures for all immigration forms, and to implement a system to facilitate two-way electronic communications with its customers” by fiscal year 2026 and notes concerns about USCIS’s progress on these efforts. USCIS’ journey to digitize its form filing system has been a tumultuous one since it first began the process in 2005. In that year, USCIS established the Transformation Program Office (TPO) with the hopes of digitizing more than 90 immigration benefit forms. In the following years, according to a 2009 report by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG), USCIS rolled out several pilot programs that “ the viability of a number of fundamental IT system capabilities required for the transformation.” Some of these pilot programs yielded results, with the Integrated Digitization and Document Management Program (Digitization) leading to the scanning of more than 600,000 paper files and the usage of the Enterprise Document Management System (EDMS) by roughly 7,900 users. Overall, however, the DHS OIG criticized the insufficient development of digitization, citing lack of comprehensive review of these pilot programs and a decentralized effort to manage IT. These criticisms of USCIS’ effort to digitize continued over the next few years as the agency continued to try to implement digital systems. In 2012, USCIS launched the Electronic Immigration System (ELIS) that was designed to allow electronic filing, case management and processing Forms I-539, I-526, and I-90.1 In 2016, due to criticisms about cost overruns and missed deliverables, this program folded and in the same year USCIS launched ELIS 2 that focused on the electronic implementation of Form N-400.2 However, this system too drew criticisms from the DHS OIG, which, in a 2017 report, found that this system introduced inefficiencies leading to an increase of 60% in backlogs and a doubling of the processing time for naturalization applications. The report led to the closing of ELIS 2. Recent years have been more favorable to USCIS. Despite the pandemic, in FY2020 USCIS experienced a 20% increase in online filings compared to FY2019, after it “ existing automation technologies and new uses for simple technologies.” In the last two years, USCIS was also able to launch Forms I-539 and I-130 for digital filing and create an electronic filing system for the H-1B cap-lottery registration, which in March 2021 saw over 300,000 filings. Despite these gains, 16 years and $2 billion later, only 12 forms out of 99 are available electronically and about 45% of forms and benefits eligible for online filing are filed. The latest CIS Ombudsman report outlined suggestions for USCIS to streamline the digitization process, including implementing outreach to encourage customers to file online and establishing&hellip;",

    "content": "Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) experience greater barriers to accessing mental health and substance use services than their white counterparts, and the COVID-19 pandemic has not only made disparities more evident, but also worsened them. As members of Congress measure possible solutions to improve behavioral health care access, it is critical they consider the benefits of integrating behavioral health services with primary care and the impacts of doing so on health equity. The need for mental health and substance use services has soared since the beginning of the pandemic, and even before that the treatment gaps were significant. Recent data for 2020 show rising drug overdose deaths, worsening of existing mental health problems, and increasing incidence of anxiety and depression. Before the pandemic in 2019, less than half of all adults with mental health conditions were receiving services. For BIPOC, the gap was significant. Research shows that in the same year, only 34% of Latino Americans, 33% of Black Americans, and 23% of Asian Americans in need of mental health services received treatment, compared to approximately 50% of white Americans. In reality, the disparity may even be bigger as these numbers do not reflect those who are undiagnosed. A major contributor to the equity gap is the lack of diversity among behavioral health providers. The current makeup of the behavioral health workforce is predominantly white. The lack of racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity in providers makes it more difficult for BIPOC patients to access a doctor or other provider who speaks their language or who they feel understands their culture. In addition, many providers lack the training for cultural competency necessary to connect in a meaningful way with their BIPOC patients and understand their unique needs, which can lead to underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed mental illness, or deter these patients from seeking care. BIPOC with limited English proficiency tend to turn more to primary care physicians to access health care services, making this a crucial entry point to our country’s health care system. One review found that culturally-tailored integrated care in Indigenous communities improved access to care and retention and reduced depression symptoms. Integrated care teams can add providers who attend to certain socio-cultural factors, such as care managers who engage family members in treatment plans, and non-clinicians who help overcome language barriers and encourage patients to continue their treatments. The situation is particularly troubling in rural areas, where there is a greater shortage of culturally competent providers. More than 60% of nonmetropolitan counties do not have a psychiatrist—regardless of cultural competency—and almost half do not have a psychologist, compared to 27% of urban counties without a psychiatrist and 19% without a psychologist. To make matters worse, BIPOC are more likely to be uninsured. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 11% of Black adults and 14% of Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander populations are uninsured, as well as a staggering 26% of Hispanic adults and 25% of Indigenous people, compared to only 9% of white adults.

    "content": "To accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and reduce emissions from the transportation sector, many policymakers have called for billions in federal funding for EV charging infrastructure. Proponents say federal spending on charging stations is necessary to meet and encourage demand for EVs and to mitigate range anxiety—consumers’ reluctance to purchase EVs out of concern that there are not enough charging stations for them to recharge easily and travel freely. As members of Congress weigh ambitious investments in charging infrastructure as part of a larger bipartisan infrastructure package, it’s worth examining the current network of charging stations to understand how federal dollars could help. EVs, on average, produce significantly fewer life-cycle emissions than gas vehicles because emissions tend to be lower for electricity generation than gasoline or diesel. Emissions from EVs are also poised to fall in the future with related efforts to decarbonize the electric grid. There are three primary types of charging stations: Level 1 and 2: Also known as alternate-current (AC) charging, these slower, less powerful chargers typically require 4-12 hours to completely charge a battery, depending on the voltage (with slow level 1 chargers mostly used for at-home charging). With a level 1 or 2 charger, a car can travel between about 4-35 miles after one hour of charging. Level 3: Also known as DC Fast charging, these more expensive chargers, on average, can fully charge an EV with a 100-mile range in a little over half an hour. These chargers are also the most expensive to install, and can cost from $50-$100k per unit. Wireless charging: this less common, lower-wattage option generally consists of a pad on the ground that connects to a receiving pad on the underside of a vehicle. Because EV charging takes longer than refilling a gas tank, EV charging stations outside of the home tend to be in locations where people park their car for extended periods of time, such as business, commercial, or municipal parking lots. On the other hand, being able to recharge at home is itself a benefit. Most cars remain parked and connected to an at-home charger for 8-12 hours at night. Since most EV drivers can charge overnight and leave the house with a fully charged vehicle every day, they require stops to charge less often than gas vehicle drivers require stops to refuel. There are currently over 43,000 level 2 and 3 public charging stations in the U.S., with about 105,000 outlets—compared to over 150,000 gas stations, most with multiple pumps. The Brattle Group estimates that the U.S. will require 1.25 million public charging outlets to support a projected 20 million (or between 10 million and 35 million) EVs by 2030, requiring investments totaling $30-$50 billion. Our national charging infrastructure is installed, owned, and operated by a mix of private and public entities. Often, charging stations involve a partnership between property owners that host the charger and a separate entity that produces, operates, and supports the charger. Since charging station owners often do not&hellip;",

    "content": "What is silvopasture? Silvopasture is the practice of intentionally integrating trees, grazing livestock, and forages on the same landscape. A type of agroforestry, this practice can help reduce emissions from agriculture and support carbon sequestration and storage in soils and biomass and is currently implemented on more than 500 million acres worldwide. Establishing trees on livestock pastures or creating animal pastures beneath trees can be an effective natural climate solution with the potential to generate environmental and economic co-benefits. Despite these advantages, there is a significant domestic opportunity for more widespread adoption of silvopasture. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), there are examples of trees and forages suitable to different regions of the country. Trees such as the black locust, a common species found in the U.S., are well suited for establishment on pasturelands because of their fast growth rates and ability to produce fodder for livestock. Further, the practice of “turning livestock into the woods” is still a popular method of grazing woodlands; but the lack of management that is prominent in this practice makes it more prone to poor environmental and economic outcomes. In this sense, silvopasture-type management could be leveraged to turn widespread unmanaged woodland grazing practices into more productive and sustainable systems. A main benefit of silvopasture is that it presents a significant opportunity for carbon mitigation. The addition of trees on pastureland increases the diversity of active carbon sinks on the landscape. In fact, Project Drawdown, an organization focused on climate change mitigation, has shown that silvopasture landscapes sequester 5 to 10 times as much carbon as pastures without trees. Additionally, the group notes that silvopasture ranks the highest amongst their other agricultural solutions with regard to its mitigation potential. Because silvopasture can be used to make existing pasture more carbon efficient or turn existing woodlands into productive grazing spaces without undergoing the process of clearcutting, the practice offers farmers high value in terms of its flexibility as a natural climate solution. Furthermore, the co-benefits that silvopasture offers may provide the needed incentives for farmers to incorporate the practice. The USDA suggests that some of the potential benefits of silvopasture include reduction in soil erosion, shade for livestock, diversified sources of income (from the additional timber, nuts, fruits etc.), increased biological diversity, improved forage quality, and more. These tangible co-benefits could be emphasized to producers and landowners to enhance practice adoption. Notably, effectively achieving these benefits requires thoughtful management. The Virginia Cooperative Extension explains the “four ‘I’ principles of Silvopastures” that are integral to successful implementation: the practice must be (I) intentional, (II) intensive, (III) integrated, and (IV) interactive. Thus, silvopasture requires consistent maintenance, planning, and an active understanding of land in order to be the most effective. In contrast, if improperly managed, silvopasture can yield various detrimental outcomes resulting from livestock. According to USDA, the integration of agriculture and forestry through practices like silvopasture was common up until the 20th century when a shift towards managing agriculture and forestry as discrete systems&hellip;",

    "content": "As the country returns to a ‘new normal,’ many American workers and their families’ daily routines will be impacted by shifting workplace demands. Black families and households have been disproportionately affected because they are overrepresented when looking at the population of essential workers. Essential workers often have unpredictable work schedules and need more care outside of the traditional work hours. As Black families navigate child care access, need, and preferences, employers need to join the conversation and provide a better business model so that parents and families can better plan for child care. Understanding Black Parents’ Child Care Needs BPC’s most recent parent survey found: Black parents need more child care options. About 38% of Black parents reported being more likely to need child care outside of traditional work hours. Black parents rely on their family members for child care support. More than one in four Black parents have received help paying for child care from grandparents or other family members (26%). Similarly, about one in four Black parents relied on their relatives to provide care for their child during the pandemic (24%). Black parents need governmental support to pay for child care. Black parents are more likely than parents of other ethnicities to say they have received a federal tax credit for their child care expenses. Approximately 74% of Black parents said that if free, public Pre-k were co-located in a child care program that offered longer hours of care, this would be a better option for their family. Aligning Child Care Needs with Black Parents’ Work Arrangements As a significant portion of the essential worker workforce, Black parents’ need more consistent work arrangements. BPC’s survey revealed: Black parents need a more fixed schedule. Only 29% of Black parents have a fixed work schedule. Black parents are divided on their preferred work situation. 35% of Black parents prefer to work remotely full-time and 35% of Black parents prefer to work in a hybrid environment. Additionally, one in four Black parents said they would like to work on-site or in the office full-time. Black parents reached consensus regarding working parents’ right to high-quality child care. 93% of Black parents agree that although parents may prefer to stay home with their young children, many do not have that option as they must work to support their family. These working parents deserve access to high-quality child care. The cost of child care and restrictive work arrangements are but a few of the barriers that families of color, especially Black families, currently face. While we have other thoughts on addressing the cost of care, employers are in a unique position to help. Most child care programs require that parents know their schedule far in advance, putting about 70% of Black parents in a difficult position to ensure care for their children. To accommodate child care centers and working families, employers should increase the number of employees with fixed work schedules, especially for parents with children under the age of 5.

    "content": "Similar to what happened in child care centers around the country, the pandemic also destabilized child care in many tribal communities. The Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, passed in December 2020, provided $10 billion in child care relief funding to states, territories, and tribes administered through the Child Care and Development Block Grant. This funding was intended to support working families and help child care providers stay in business during the pandemic with broad flexibility in how it could be spent. Of the $10 billion, $275 million (2.75% of the total CRRSA funds) was allocated to tribes. Note: This percentage is consistent with the CCDBG discretionary funding levels set aside for tribes by the Department of Health and Human Services in fiscal year 2021. Tribal lead agencies were required to submit a report to HHS 60 days after the enactment of CRRSA outlining how they planned to spend their funds. HHS directed lead agencies to address five main categories: direct child care services (subsidies); virus mitigation policies and practices; grants to stabilize child care providers; assistance to providers not participating in the Child Care and Development Fund prior to the pandemic; and, other. HHS also created guidelines for how funds can be spent within each category. Given the short turnaround, HHS allowed tribes to submit that they were seeking additional spending guidance or to  submit a tentative or partial report by February 25 with a timeline for a finalized version. The $275 million was allocated to 265 of the 574 federally recognized tribes. The amount of funds allocated to each tribe was based on their reported child counts.  CCDF regulations state that a tribe must have at least 50 children under the age of 13 to receive funding; otherwise they can join a consortium that represents multiple tribes that meet such requirements. As of April 23, BPC had access to 251 of the 265 tribal reports to HHS. This blog provides an analysis of the tribal reports for each of the categories issued by HHS. About 230 tribes who submitted reports indicated they plan to spend at least some of their funds on subsidies or other direct child care services. The most commonly cited use of the funds was providing reduced or free tuition to frontline and essential workers through the pandemic, followed by copay relief for all parents. For providers, tribes plan to help pay for current employee salaries as well as fund new staff hires. Of the 199 tribes who reported in this category, about 175 tribes indicated they will use funding to provide PPE to child care providers, including sanitation and cleaning supplies. Multiple tribes reported they will also distribute PPE directly to families. Many tribes indicated they will provide technical assistance and information to providers about state and local health and safety guidelines. Furthermore, some tribes will use funds to finance facility renovations to improve and upgrade sanitation conditions. Of the 161 tribes who reported in this category, 55 said they will issue grants&hellip;",

    "content": "In the current discussions about competition policy and big tech, a more technologically focused approach to boosting competition has been the promotion of “data portability” and “interoperability.” However, many are unclear about what these terms mean and how they relate to competition in the technology sector. This piece will answer those questions and others to help inform the current debates around antitrust and competition. Although these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, data portability generally refers to a users’ ability to easily download or transfer their personal data from a digital platform in an organized and machine-readable format, while interoperability generally refers to the ability of computational systems to regularly interact and exchange information with one another through a standardized and well-documented interface in real-time. A user downloading all their photos from a cloud storage platform onto their personal computer or another digital platform would be an example of portability. A user authorizing a social media platform to regularly update their profile with new photos from another platform in real-time is an example of interoperability. Advocates for greater data portability and interoperability argue these tools will boost competition by lowering switching costs for customers and reducing barriers to entry for non-incumbent firms. For instance, the ability to move photos from one service to another can make it easier for customers to switch to a new startup platform and give the startup access to data they can use to create a better product. This can further pressure incumbent firms to reduce prices or improve their quality to keep existing customers. However, critics contend data is not a major barrier to switching services for users and that mandating data portability and interoperability will increase compliance costs with little benefit and could unintentionally hurt competition. Further, critics and advocates argue over the extent of the implementation challenges, which will be the topic of the next section. Data portability and interoperability face several hurdles to implementation. In addition to the costs , there are other challenges, such as designing the right technical standards, and addressing privacy and security concerns. The process of defining and maintaining common standards for portable and interoperable data can be challenging. Each platform will likely have different priorities for how the standards are designed, depending on their business model and those of their competitors. Further, how exactly certain kinds of data should be represented through the application programming interface (API) or portable format might be difficult to define between services that do not use the same ‘language’ &#8211; for example, how might a ‘retweet’ on Twitter be represented on Facebook? Will Instagram’s ‘stories’, images and videos meant to disappear after 24 hours, be shared with competitors who can display them in perpetuity? The coordination challenges, technical feasibility, and scope of the various standards are important issues to consider and address. Data portability and interoperability also raise privacy and security concerns. Interoperable APIs, by design, grant easy access to secure data systems using methods to verify whether any requests for data are legitimate.&hellip;",

Stakeholders lack confidence in project milestones, and there is limited ability to track infrastructure projects as they move through the process. Weak coordination among federal agencies has also been a major issue. The lengthy and complex permitting and environmental review processes can add to projects’ time and cost, while deterring private capital from investing. Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015, known as FAST-41, sought to address these issues. Project sponsors can request to participate in a process which provides for coordinated and expedited multiagency reviews, so long as they abide by FAST-41 requirements. FAST-41 also created a Permitting Dashboard to increase transparency, listing federal projects with a timetable for when permits will be approved. Additionally, FAST-41 established the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC) to improve interagency coordination and reduce timelines for project approvals. The FAST-41 process begins with a consultation, followed by a determination as to whether the proposed project is eligible—or “covered”—under the law. Within 60 days, a permitting timetable is released including a delineation of all required permits, reviews, and approvals and target dates for achieving them.

Source: Federal Infrastructure Projects Permitting Dashboard  FAST-41 has brought substantial, concrete improvements to the permitting and environmental review process: Transparency and predictability: The Permitting Dashboard provides an easily accessible resource so all stakeholders can track projects as they make their way through multiple reviews. With a clear understanding of the process and timelines, project sponsors—and the general public—can more effectively anticipate the start date. Under FAST-41, the final completion date for reviews cannot be pushed back more than 30 days without consulting the project sponsor. Interagency coordination: FPISC harmonizes the process for permits across multiple agencies to encourage resource-sharing and avoid duplication, requiring relevant agencies to submit a comprehensive project plan and timetable to complete all necessary approvals. According to FPISC’s annual report to Congress for fiscal year 2020, FAST-41 reduced timelines by 45% to complete an environmental impact statement (EIS). The average FAST-41 project took about 2.5 years to complete an EIS, compared to 4.5 years for the average EIS duration from 2010-2018. One project saved up to $12.6 million as a result of time savings. Accountability: FPISC has a mandate to hold agencies responsible for adhering to review timelines and mediate any disputes. The council must also report significant delays to Congress as well as annual reports that assess agencies’ progress in implementing best practices and performance schedules. Stakeholder Participation and Reasonable Limitations to Judicial Delays: FAST-41 requires those that might file a NEPA challenge to first participate in the permitting process by commenting during the environmental review process. It also reduces the statute of limitations for challenging&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 22, the House passed the Averting Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting SIVs Act of 2021 (Allies Act) by an overwhelming majority of 407-16. The bill, which was introduced in the House by Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), received an astounding consensus on both sides of the aisle to protect the lives of Afghans who aided and served alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Even though immigration has been a bitterly partisan subject in Congress, the passage of this bill demonstrates that immigration reform on some key issues is still possible. The Allies Act increases the ceiling of special immigrant visas made available to qualified Afghan nationals and eases some restrictions related to the program. The bill also makes an additional 8,000 visas available for principal applicants, not counting dependents, under the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program. This is in addition to the 4,000 visas that were authorized under the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 2021. Congress first passed the Afghan Allies Protection Act in 20091 as part of that year’s omnibus funding measure; the bill was designed to provide 7,500 visas over five years. Congress subsequently passed several program extensions in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2021, and since December 2014 the SIV program has allocated 26,500 visas for Afghan applicants, including for surviving spouses or children of an Afghan national who assisted the U.S. military. Furthermore, on July 27, the Senate Committee on Appropriations included equivalent provisions to the Allies Act in the Senate’s bipartisan emergency funding bill for Capitol Hill security. The package commits $1 billion for the SIV program, including providing the Department of Defense’s Overseas, Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid program with $500 million in emergency transportation, housing, and other services for Afghan partners who are leaving the country. On July 29, the Senate unanimously passed the emergency spending package, 98-0. The House followed suit the same day, passing the bill with a vote of 416-11, and sending the bill to the president for signature. This willingness to come together and legislate on important immigration issues is a reminder that Congress still works when it wants to. While major immigration reform has been unable to overcome this era’s partisan stalemate, the passage of the Allies Act of 2021 is a timely reminder that bipartisan action is still possible. This is a victory for both parties, and functions as a reminder that Congress can deliver immigration reform when necessary and urgent.",

And while all eyes are on Olympic champion Simone Biles and her decision to pull out of the women’s gymnastics team final and individual all-around competitions, BPC is reminded by her choice of how important it is to act on integrating mental health and primary care. In BPC’s March 2021 report, Tackling America’s Mental Health and Addiction Crisis Through Primary Care Integration, our Behavioral Health Integration Task Force outlined a comprehensive set of policy recommendations to achieve this goal. The recommendations are based on a model that is already demonstrating evidence of improved outcomes and cost effectiveness: integrating mental health and substance use care with primary care. While research has documented the link between physical and mental health, it is hard for many of us to imagine that those in peak physical health can and do suffer from mental health challenges. This is likely part of the enduring stigma around mental health issues that deters many elite athletes from seeking help. However, BPC believes this only serves to bolster our claim for the need for behavioral health and integration for the rest of us: 51.1 million Americans suffer from mental health issues during any given year, with many more likely not reporting their challenges to health care providers. This is a need that has only grown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and one which has likely been intensified by new research indicating individuals with mental health disorders are at greater risk of mortality from COVID-19. An important step toward integration is expanding the workforce and increasing primary care provider capacity. The goal here is to provide primary care providers with supports that would enable them to improve mental health screenings, deliver more treatment for mild to moderate conditions, and coordinate care for patients who need specialized services. While nearly 40% of people who receive behavioral health care already get it through their primary care provider, many of those providers just don’t have the training, financial resources, guidance, and staff to deliver integrated care. In order to successfully integrate care, BPC’s task force recommended defining for payers a set of baseline service standards and performance metrics informed by a wide array of stakeholders. This will ensure access to quality care is equitable across geographic regions and among people who are underserved. These standards can be used to build upon existing payment models to drive large-volume integration in Medicaid, as well as incorporated into financial incentives within Medicare and Medicare Advantage for individual providers. Some states have already tackled this issue through Medicaid Managed Care Organizations, with results indicating both cost savings and better health outcomes for their patients. Simone Biles isn’t the first Olympic athlete to draw attention to mental health concerns, and we can’t imagine she’ll be the last. But for now, we know one thing is true: she has snagged a win better than Gold in expanding the discussion around the importance of prioritizing&hellip;",

    "content": "The debates around privacy and security will likely broaden as immersive technologies become more pervasive in civil society. Virtual reality headsets can track people&#8217;s eye movement, while augmented reality glasses can record bystanders in various locations. The Bipartisan Policy Center brought together a diverse range of stakeholders representing industry, civil society, and other relevant organizations for a convening on XR privacy and security to preemptively discuss many of the policy debates likely to occur in the coming years. To encourage candor, the convening followed Chatham House rules, so this post will not identify individual participants. Hypothetical Scenarios The initial phase of this convening focused on two hypothetical scenarios involving XR applications. The goal was to imagine potential privacy and security challenges that would arise while looking for various remedies and safeguards to prevent harm. We presented the first scenario about a VR app that helps identify and manage stress for health care and workplace purposes. The application relied on capturing certain biometric information, such as eye movement. We first asked participants to identify the privacy and security challenges involved in this scenario. Many participants identified the collection, storage, and use of biometric data to be a primary concern. Once stolen, biometric information is virtually impossible to change. Your fingerprint cannot be reset the same way a password can be. This makes data breaches a major concern. Personal information may also be inferred through biometric data, such as health characteristics, age, and gender. This raises the prospect of discrimination against a protected class in areas such as hiring. Compliance with existing healthcare regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), was another concern raised; participants were uncertain when HIPAA laws would apply. Power asymmetries between workers and companies also raised concerns among participants. For instance, what rights do employees have to opt-out of such a service, could employers access any data collected about employees, and what rights did employees have to review and delete any data collected about them? Participants suggested several methods for addressing these various challenges, including safeguarding data using encryption, anonymization, autodeletion, or adding user access and control of the data and audit trails. Policy-focused suggestions included enforcing compliance with existing privacy laws, restricting the use and sale of data, and informing users about risks using similar devices. The second scenario presented was about AR glasses that could help users navigate a city while recording their surroundings to improve the glasses&#8217; navigation capability. In this scenario, participants expressed concerns primarily focused on bystander privacy, especially in sensitive locations. For instance, someone walking by a health clinic and recording people entering and exiting the building. From location data to facial recognition, bystanders often unintentionally give up their data as they walk through a public space. Multiple participants discussed what constitutes meaningful consent in this scenario and more broadly. Again, participants questioned how the data is collected and stored on such a device, especially for children and un-consenting adults. Participants also raised concerns about user privacy (such&hellip;",

    "content": "Decades of insufficient action in the face of climate change has created a reality where emissions reduction strategies, like switching to renewable power and electric vehicles, cannot entirely solve the problem; instead, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible need to be paired with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in order to keep global warming below critical temperature thresholds. In fact, a 2019 report by the National Academies finds that &#8220;if the goals for climate and economic growth are to be achieved&#8221; CDR globally must scale to the gigaton level by 2050. This is echoed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which points out that all pathways for limiting global warming to 1.5°C require gigatons of CDR each year. To achieve this scale, a portfolio of solutions including both natural and engineered CDR will be crucial. Direct air capture (DAC), which removes carbon dioxide from the ambient air, is one of the most scalable forms of CDR because of its siting flexibility and limited land-use requirements. However, despite the urgent need to scale DAC to the gigaton level, less than 10,000 tons of global annual capacity are currently operational. While the exact capacity of CDR needed globally in 2050 and 2100 largely depends on how rapidly and deeply countries reduce emissions, we do know that a large scale up in capacity is necessary this decade to enable the supply chains and cost declines necessary for gigaton-scale carbon removal with DAC in later decades. It’s worth noting that while this scale up is large in a relative sense because DAC capacity is starting from a very low baseline, the absolute scale up of DAC capacity looks far less daunting when compared to clean energy deployment. Although the primary focus of climate policy and investment must continue to be on deploying clean energy technologies and protecting forests, setting a 2030 goal for DAC deployment will help ensure alignment with what science dictates is necessary for midcentury climate targets. While climate change is global, the U.S. has a unique opportunity to establish itself as a world leader in DAC deployment and to ensure that the technology is ready to play a meaningful role in the fight against climate change. To establish this leadership, BPC&#8217;s DAC Advisory Council recommends a deployment target of at least 7 million tons of annual DAC capacity (operational or under construction) in the U.S. by 2030. Delaying the deployment of DAC by even a few years could substantially hamper our ability to meet midcentury climate goals. With 7 million tons of annual capacity in 2030, DAC capacity would then need to grow by approximately 30% for each of the following 20 years to reach the gigaton level by 2050. This is aggressive, but doable–wind and solar technologies have scaled up with year-over-year growth rates in the range of 15-30%. If, however, we have only deployed 2 million tons of DAC capacity by 2030, even an aggressive 30% growth rate will leave us woefully short of&hellip;",

    "content": "There is much we don’t know about how families afford child care, but here’s what we do know. The child care marketplace prices many parents out of the market, resulting in devastating effects for working families and the American economy. The true cost of child care is more than what most parents can afford. The pandemic made it harder for parents to afford child care. The pandemic put more stress on an already broken model, as costs have increased, revenue has decreased, and our survey data estimates that around 10 percent of all child care providers have permanently closed. Even with how hard it is to afford child care, it remains an essential expense for families. BPC and Morning Consult conducted a survey of 800 parents of young children in households where all parents were working. This is our fifth parent survey to better understand how work settings are changing, how that impacts child care demands, and how families are paying for their changing child care needs. The survey was conducted between May 20 and May 31, 2021 to determine parents’ use and preferred form of financial supports for child care, including the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC). The CDCTC, enacted in 1976, is a tax policy that reduces families’ federal income tax liability—or the amount they must pay in federal income taxes each year. Families may claim up to $3,000 in care expenses per child or dependent for up to two children or dependents. The family, based on their income level, can then receive between 20-35% of those expenses back as their credit. The higher the families’ income, the lower percentage they are allowed to claim. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) altered the CDCTC for 2021. The ARP: Increases the maximum amount of child or dependent care expenses families can claim from $3,000 to $8,000 per child or dependent; Increases the percentage of those expenses families will receive as a credit from up to 35% to up to 50%; and Makes the credit fully refundable. Making the credit fully refundable is critical to better supporting low-income families. Ensuring low-income families are eligible to receive a tax credit for their child care expenses, even those with little or no tax liability, is another method of financial assistance so families can better afford the high costs of child care. To calculate how much your household might be able to receive, check out BPC&#8217;s CDCTC calculator. The following describes key findings from the May survey. For the purposes of our analysis, low-income refers to incomes under $50k, middle-income refers to incomes from $50k-$100k, and high-income refers to incomes above $100k. Although the CDCTC is widely available, less than half of parents (42%) report receiving it. Although low-income parents stand to benefit the most from financial assistance, low-income parents (42%) are less likely than middle- (52%) and high- (50%) income parents to report receiving the CDCTC for their child care expenses. Parents in suburban (44%) and urban (42%) areas are more&hellip;",

The bills passed largely along partisan lines, with notable exceptions on both sides. There was wider bipartisan support for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act (H.R. 3843) and State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act (H.R. 3460) than the other bills, but both still faced opposition. The following is a factual summary of each bill without commentary on the alleged problem they seek to remedy, or if they are the appropriate response. The following bills create a new designation, the “covered platform”, that is utilized in several of the bills in this package. A “covered platform” is a status that can be designated by the FTC or Department of Justice upon an online platform that meets all three of the following criteria: has at least 50 million active monthly users in the U.S.; has at least 100 thousand active monthly business users in the U.S.; and is owned or controlled by someone with a market capitalization of over $600 billion. H.R.3816 &#8211; American Choice and Innovation Online Act Prohibits covered platforms from: Engaging in conduct on their platform that advantages their own products and services, disadvantages other business user products or services, or discriminates between similar business users Utilizing non-public data generated by business users Restricting business users from accessing data they generated Interfering with a business user’s pricing strategy Restricting or impeding interoperability within their platform An exception to the above restrictions is made if a covered platform can clearly and convincingly demonstrate that a practice either: Does not harm the competitive process Is narrowly tailored and cannot be achieved “through a less discriminatory means”, and was necessary to comply with federal and state law or to protect user privacy and data Increases consumer welfare (per Bentz amendment) H.R.3825 &#8211; Ending Platform Monopolies Act Prohibits covered platforms from owning businesses, other than the covered platform itself, that: Utilize their platform for the sale of their own products or services Offer a product or service that a business user would need to purchase for access or preferred placement on the covered platform Create a conflict of interest. H.R.3826 &#8211; Platform Competition and Opportunity Act of 2021 Restricts acquisitions by covered platform of current or potential competitors, or acquisition that would enhance the covered platforms market position Restricts acquisitions by covered platform of current or potential competitors, or acquisition that would enhance the covered platforms market position An exception is made permitting platforms to acquire other entities if the assets are valued at less than $50 million (per Ross amendment).

    "content": "The discussion of migrants arriving to the United States in the last several years has primarily focused on migration from the Northern Triangle of Central America and Mexico to the southern border, with little attention to migrants arriving from other countries. Yet, so far in fiscal year 2021, the most dramatic increases in migrant arrivals are from countries in Central Europe, South America, and the Caribbean. Last week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released their June 2021 data that includes information concerning the citizenship of migrants arriving to the United States at both its northern and southern borders.1 Even though migrants from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries make up nearly 75% of the encounters so far in FY2021, they are not the only countries contributing to the record-setting number of migrant encounters. Figure 1 shows the 10 countries with the most encounters by CBP (persons who are inadmissible at entry or encountered between the ports of entry) in FY2020 and fiscal year-to-date 2021. Most notably, 54,543 migrants encountered in FYTD2021 were from Ecuador, compared to just 10,241 by this same time in FY2020. Brazil has also increased its share of migrants arriving to the U.S. this year with 29,492 encounters compared to 8,749 in FYTD2020. This is more than three times the number of migrant encounters Brazilians had in all of FY2020. Earlier this year, encounters with Cuban migrants rapidly increased, hitting a peak in March of 5,716. While the number of Cuban encounters to the U.S. has steadily decreased since then, monthly encounters are still significantly higher than they were in FY2020. While the top-10 origination countries in Figure 1 provide a clear picture of the border dynamics, it is also important to note the countries that have seen the biggest increases in arrivals. As shown in Figure 2, Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Haiti make up the fastest-growing migrant-sending countries between June 2020 and June 2021. Encounters with migrants from Venezuela increased 13,951% between June 2020 and June 2021. In comparison, Mexican migrant encounters only increased by 137% in that same time period. This influx of Venezuelan migrants comes following a massive exodus of Venezuelans to other countries in South America over the last few years. In response to the growing humanitarian crisis and many years of lobbying, the United States granted temporary protected status (TPS) to Venezuelans currently present in the U.S. in early March 2021. Migrants from Brazil are the second fastest growing population. In June 2020, 80 Brazilians were encountered by CBP. In June 2021, 6,678 Brazilians were encountered—a marked 8,248% increase. This increase correlates strongly with Brazil’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 data, Brazil has recorded the world’s second highest COVID-19 death toll, and as of July 2021 surpassed 19 million confirmed cases. Reports have referred to these Brazilian migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border as pandemic refugees. In addition, between June 2020 and June 2021, the number of encounters of Haitian migrants grew by 2,906%, making&hellip;",

    "content": "The Senate recently passed S. 1260, the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 (USICA), on a bipartisan 68-32 vote. Sponsored by Sens. Schumer (D-NY) and Young (R-Ind), the legislation contains $250 billion in new spending focused on a wide variety of topics, including scientific research, microprocessor manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and space exploration. However, at the heart of the USICA is the $150 billion Endless Frontier Act (EFA). The bill failed to move in the 116th Congress. The companion bill, sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna, has been in committee since April 2021. The Endless Frontier Act is a thematically focused piece of legislation, touching National Science Foundation (NSF) research, manufacturing, supply chain resiliency, and technology. At the core of the EFA is a plan to create and fund a new directorate within the NSF, the Directorate of Technology and Innovation. The NSF is one of the premier STEM research funding sources in the United States, with a 2020 budget of $8.2 billion. The bill funds the new directorate with $5.8 billion per year over the next five years or approximately 70% of total previous NSF funding. The legislation would also designate $52 billion over the next five years for existing NSF activities, or $10.4 billion per year. A substantial expansion in STEM research and manufacturing funding could be transformative for the American technology and innovation sector. In addition to increased NSF funding, the EFA would identify, designate, and provide $10 billion in funding to create several regional innovation hubs across the country. Legislative details are unclear regarding funding for regional technology hubs. Nevertheless, information can be extrapolated from several of the sources that the legislation can be traced. A 2019 joint Brookings Institute/ITIF report, ‘The Case for Growth Centers: How to Spread Tech Innovation Across America’ and a book by MIT professors Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson, ’Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revive Economic Growth and the American Dream’ discuss the idea of utilizing federal funding to supercharge the American innovation industry. Both addressed several broad-based issues associated with concentration among the innovation firms in Silicon Valley, Boston, the NC Research Triangle, and Seattle, such as high housing costs, gridlock, and an agglomeration of technology jobs. Importantly, each devised plans to develop the innovation industry throughout the rest of the country. The EFA builds off their work with a goal of promoting innovation throughout the country. The bill would authorize the Department of Commerce to use tax and regulatory incentives, public-private partnerships, workforce development, and other methods to establish and grow the hubs. However, the most significant issue that arises from federally funded regional innovation hubs is how to ultimately select the winning locations from across the country. The methodology utilized in the Brookings/ITIF report places substantial value on population, innovation capacity, the skill level of the population, and distance from an existing innovation hub. Drs. Gruber and Johnson measure the initial three, in addition to several other socioeconomic metrics, including home prices and crime levels. Possibly the&hellip;",

    "content": "This was originally posted by Melville Charitable Trust, which supports the work of BPC’s Housing Advisory Council. One of the enduring lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic is how fundamental housing is to us all. As the pandemic raged, our homes became places of safety and sanctuary. Spending more time at home became a public health imperative—with our homes transformed into full-time places of work and school. In the post-pandemic world, working at home will likely be the “new normal” for tens of millions of Americans. Unfortunately, at a time when homes are becoming even more central to our lives, too many Americans are facing severe housing affordability challenges. There is less housing available for rent or sale than at any time in the past 30 years, as the annual supply of new homes runs some 100,000 behind new housing demand. In total, the construction of new housing in the past 20 years fell over 5.5 million units short of long-term historical levels. With supply so scarce and demand so high, it is no surprise that rents and home sale prices are skyrocketing. The result of this supply-demand mismatch is that millions of households—most with low and moderate incomes—are burdened with unsustainable rents, often exceeding 50% of their monthly paycheck. Communities with rising rents and cost burdens, not unexpectedly, see commensurate increases in homelessness. At the same time, millions of potential first-time homebuyers—many of them millennials born in the 1980s and 1990s—are being priced out in their local housing markets and blocked from stepping on the first rung of the homeownership ladder. The result is fewer households benefiting from the wealth-building opportunities that owning a home can provide. We cannot ignore the racial dimensions of the housing affordability crisis either. People of color are dramatically overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness, with African Americans representing about 40% of the homeless population even though they represent only 13% of the general population. Black, Native American, and other people of color are also disproportionately represented among those who pay unaffordable rents, often in substandard homes located in communities with few opportunities. Racial gaps in rates of homeownership are similarly stark: while today’s white homeownership rate is 73.8%, the rate for Hispanics is 49.3% and for Blacks is 45.1%. Multiple studies have shown that family wealth is intimately connected to homeownership: the median net worth of homeowners is more than 40 times that of renters. Taking proactive steps to close the racial gaps in the homeownership rate is essential to creating a more just and fair society that will benefit everyone. We are heartened that several important housing initiatives are being considered in the ongoing discussions about how to upgrade America’s infrastructure. Importantly, many of these initiatives also enjoy strong bipartisan support. Significantly expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, a program initially created by Sens. George Mitchell (D-ME) and John Danforth (R-MO), can help harness tens of billions of dollars in private investment to build and preserve millions of affordable rental homes.

    "content": "On June 15, 2021, Rep. Henry Cuellar introduced the bipartisan Returning Worker Exception Act of 2021 which seeks to exempt all returning H-2B visa workers from the cap system. According to the bill, this cap-related reform will help ensure that small and seasonal businesses can find necessary workers during the post-pandemic economic recovery. The legislation would require the Department of Labor to provide an online registry of available jobs to the public as well as improve the program’s anti-fraud measures to better protect U.S. workers and migrant workers. Congress has so far failed to reconcile the H-2B federal level policy to meet states’ needs for temporary and seasonal workers. This new bill is Congress’ latest attempt at modernizing the visa program’s contentious cap regulation. The H-2B visa program is used by U.S. employers to hire temporary and seasonal nonagricultural foreign workers. While the program remains popular, its cap-provisions are a contentious issue among lawmakers and immigration experts. Proponents of tightly regulating the visa program argue that employers use them to undercut U.S. worker wages, whereas those arguing for liberalization suggest that most H-2B employers are following the program rules and violations are not systemic. Liberalization proponents also insist that increased regulations making the legal pathway too onerous will make violations and the hiring of unauthorized workers more attractive. Currently, the H-2B visa program is relatively small, capped at 66,000 visas per year. However, employers’ need for temporary and seasonal workers has outgrown the programs capacity. Since 2010, the demand for H-2B workers has steadily increased, and each year the cap is exhausted relatively quickly, making it challenging and competitive for employers across the country to fulfill their labor needs. To address this supply and demand imbalance, Congress has implemented some cap-related reforms over the last several years. Some of these reforms include dividing the H-2B visa category semi-annually; 33,000 from October 1-March 31 and 33,000, plus all the unused visas from the previous fiscal year, from April 1-September 30, allowing employers with differing seasonal worker needs to access visas. Other reforms include exempting certain types of workers and foreign employees already in the United States or who are returning within the same fiscal year. Occupations such as technicians and fish roe processors have been exempted, and so have workers in the U.S. territories such as Guam and Puerto Rico. However, these policies have sometimes exacerbated the challenge for employers by making it harder to find seasonal workers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that the H-2B cap for FY2021 was reached on February 12, 2021, and any other employment that started before October 1, 2021, would not be reviewed, leaving many employers scrambling to fulfill summer labor needs. In each fiscal year since 2017, Congress authorized the Department of Homeland Security to exceed the 66,000-cap and make additional H-2B visas available at its discretion. Each year DHS has done so, but even the additional visas are not enough to meet employer demand. In 2021, the Biden administration added 22,000&hellip;",

    "content": "Key Takeaways Reform for greater inclusion of business owners of color. Upgrade SBA systems and processes. Expand institutional participation in government lending support programs. On the last day of May 2021, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) officially ended. This initiative, created by Congress in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, was a centerpiece of the federal government’s emergency relief efforts. In total, Congress authorized just over $800 billion for small business loans through PPP. In an event just before the end of PPP, the Bipartisan Policy Center asked, “After PPP: How Should Small Business Lending Programs Be Reformed?” Together with our partner, PayPal, we brought together several experts to explore lessons learned from the crisis. The discussion extended a highly substantive dialogue on small business finance in March. Reflecting on the Paycheck Protection Program PPP wasn’t perfect; there were complaints of improper payments and fraudulent applications. The Small Business Administration’s Inspector General cited other issues, too. Yet it was also effective in helping many small companies survive the crisis and sustain employment. Representative French Hill (R-AR) highlighted the bipartisan origins of the “amazing” program in the CARES Act of March 2020. My hat’s off to the bipartisan leadership in passing CARES and former Secretary Mnuchin in crafting this concept. … Government, on a bipartisan basis, in an emergency, can step up and do something new and innovative that was very responsive to the unique crisis. Congressman Hill is a former banker and co-founder and co-chair of the House Entrepreneurship Caucus. Other event participants also cited the unique and successful aspects of PPP. The program “really stretched our minds in terms of the world of possibilities with small business lending,” said Shafika Deria, senior government relations associate at JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co. Deria pointed to “policymakers and lenders alike … asking more questions, they’re listening, and they’re even more aware of the needs of small businesses” because of PPP. Likewise, Scott Stewart, CEO of the Innovative Lending Platform Association (ILPA), called the PPP achievement “astonishing.” Nevertheless, for many small businesses, the pandemic hangover persists. Janice Jucker is owner and president of Three Brothers Bakery in Houston, and co-chair of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices National Leadership Council. Still Work to Be Done As Jucker pointed out, many small businesses will feel the effects of COVID-19 through 2021 and into 2022. “It takes years,” Jucker said, “to recoup a 35% revenue loss.” Policymakers cannot expect to simply return capital access and loan support programs to the pre-crisis status quo. An area most in need of policy reform is inclusion, expanding capital access for business owners of color. Citing JPMorgan Chase Institute research showing racial gaps in small business cash liquidity prior to the crisis, Deria emphasized the “need to build in inclusion from the start” for public programs. Upgrading the SBA For fiscal year 2020, the SBA was authorized to approve $22.5 billion in loan guarantees through its 7(a) program. PPP was a new&hellip;",

    "content": "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued new policy updates in the USCIS Policy Manual to clarify the criteria for expedited processing; improve guidance on requests for evidence (RFE) and notices of intent to deny (NOID); and increase the validity period for initial and renewal employment authorization documents (EADs) for certain noncitizens with pending adjustment of status applications. The new guidance reverses Trump administration policies altering USCIS’s prior internal adjudication protocol for the H-1B high-skilled nonimmigrant visa. In 2019, BPC analyzed how the Trump administration’s internal guidance on adjudication affected H-1B petition RFE rates as well as the rate at which those receiving an RFE were subsequently approved. Specifically, we discussed how an October 2017 memo raising the burden of proof for H-1B petitions and rescinding the policy requiring officers to defer to prior determinations for extension of nonimmigrant status which was blamed for much of the increase in denials. Following the Biden administration’s reversal of that memo, early data suggests that the RFE rate for H-1B petitions could continue to decline for the rest of the fiscal year. According to new USCIS data, in comparison to fiscal years 2018 and 2019, FY2020 data show a significant decrease in the percentage of H-1B petitions that received an RFE even before the end of the Trump administration. As shown in Figure 1, the number of H-1B petitions that received an RFE dropped from approximately 40% in FY2019 to 29% in FY2020 (which ended October 1, 2020). As shown in Figure 2, even if an H-1B petition received an RFE, the rate at which petitions were subsequently approved has steadily increased since FY2018, from 62% in FY2018 to 73% in FY2020. This increase in the RFE approval rate indicates that the challenges H-1B applicants faced to get their petitions approved during the Trump presidency started to improve even before the recent guidance change. As shown in Figure 3, the number of H-1B petitions that have received an RFE in the first quarter of FY2021 has fallen to 25%, a stark drop from the quarterly highs of FY2018 and FY2019. Furthermore, even if the petition received an RFE, 85.4% were subsequently approved in the second quarter of FY2021, suggesting that the Biden administration’s early policy reversals are influencing how often a petition receives an RFE, and whether that petition is subsequently approved. The decrease in the H-1B RFE rate and the increase in the RFE approval rate over the last year have been driven by two factors. The first is court rulings. In the last year, several court rulings struck down Trump-era policies, resulting in changes to several previous USCIS H-1B adjudication procedures. Innova Solutions v. Baran (2020) and ITServe Alliance v. L. Francis Cissna (2020) led to the dismantling of key policies used to restrict H-1B petitions such as the “Contracts and Itineraries Requirements for H-1B Petitions Involving Third-Party Worksites” and the October 2017 policy memorandum previously mentioned. Secondly, the Biden administration has followed suit with the courts’ logic, rescinding&hellip;",

Overall, parents in our survey reported: Negative changes in their children’s daily routines and A high interest in acquiring support to address their child’s social and emotional health. As we recover from the pandemic, it’s important that policymakers, child care providers, and families keep these issues top of mind as future investments are made to best support children’s development. Parents reported that the pandemic had a negative impact on their children’s routines and behaviors. One-quarter of parents reported that their children’s daily eating habits (24%), ability to follow rules (24%), and amount of sleep nightly (23%) changed negatively over the past month. When exploring these behavioral impacts by geographical area, we found parents in urban areas were more likely to report negative health changes than parents from suburban or rural areas. Urban parents’ reports of negative changes in daily eating habits (33%) and communication skills (21%) were about double that of parents in rural areas (16% and 10%, respectively). Interestingly, parents with higher income levels were more likely to report certain negative developmental changes like changes in amounts of sleep, attention span, and communication skills. The survey results also highlighted differences between families needing care during traditional hours versus those needing care during non-traditional hours. Parents needing care during non-traditional hours were more likely to report that their children’s overall development had changed negatively across all eight indicators. More notably, 1 in 3 parents needing care during non-traditional hours reported negative changes in their children’s eating habits, amounts of sleep, and ability to follow rules. Moreover, geographical differences were also present in parents’ reports of their child’s overall suspension or expulsion incidences from child care because of behavioral or disciplinary issues. Urban parents (14%) were more likely than suburban (3%) or rural parents (8%) to say that their child had been suspended or expelled from child care. The parent survey responses also revealed that the majority of parents would be interested in a social and emotional health consultation if it was made available to them by their primary child care arrangement. Social and emotional health consultations have been shown to improve parent-child relationships, reduce and avert mental health problems, and promote children’s social and emotional competencies by guiding and supporting parents in raising healthy children. Overall, three quarters of parents (76%) reported being interested in a social and emotional health consultation, with 38% of parents reporting they are very interested and 38% of parents reporting they are somewhat interested. Parents with a higher educational and income level were more likely to express strong interest in a social and emotional health consultation. Urban parents (57%) were twice as likely to report strong interest in this type of consultation compared to suburban (29%) and rural (24%) parents. Parents with Hispanic children (48%) were most likely to&hellip;",

We also include a national survey of undergraduates’ views on the classroom climate for open exchange. A Military Appointment at Swarthmore Colleen Flaherty| Inside Higher Ed | June 14, 2021 “Swarthmore College on Friday reaffirmed its partnership with the Chamberlain Project and therefore its commitment to hosting a military scholar, following months of internal debate. ‘I did not arrive at this decision easily, and I appreciate that it will disappoint if not anger some segment of our community,’ President Val Smith wrote in an all-campus message &#8230; ‘I ultimately drew from the college’s mission and my fundamental belief that critical to the liberal arts is our ability to engage in the exchange of diverse and often opposing views, not to shut them out.’” It’s Time for an Overhaul of Academic Freedom Emily Levine | Washington Post | June 9, 2021 “Even as it protects an increasingly small share of academia, the absence of a positive vision for academic freedom untethers its beneficiaries from responsibilities to society or citizenship. Academic freedom and tenure are instead linked in a circular logic: Academic freedom is expressed through tenure, and tenure is justified by the need for academic freedom… Only through a new consensus can educators move beyond a negative definition that arises out of conflict to a positive definition attuned to speech in an educational environment that furthers the mission of the academy.” Joint Statement on Efforts to Restrict Education about Racism American Association of University Professors, PEN America, the American Historical Association, and the Association of American Colleges &#038; Universities | June 16, 2021 “We, the undersigned associations and organizations, state our firm opposition to a spate of legislative proposals being introduced across the country that target academic lessons, presentations, and discussions of racism and related issues in American history in schools, colleges and universities. … First, these bills risk infringing on the right of faculty to teach and of students to learn. The clear goal of these efforts is to suppress teaching and learning about the role of racism in the history of the United States. … Second, these legislative efforts seek to substitute political mandates for the considered judgment of professional educators, hindering students’ ability to learn and engage in critical thinking across differences and disagreements.” The statement has been co-signed by over 100 organizations. How to Truly Protect Academic Freedom Tom Ginsburg | Chronicle of Higher Education| June 16, 2021 The author recommends the establishment of campus offices of academic freedom: “Without an institutional base to protect free inquiry, standards are applied in an uneven way. The risk is that administrators will simply give in to the loudest voice in the room, which will, by definition, never be someone whose full-time job is to speak up for academic freedom.

    "content": "Higher education researchers have found six experiences that make for success after graduation. High on the list: being active in extracurricular activities like student government associations. SGAs are bodies that work out the details of campus life through the student senate, the student judiciary, and oversight of student clubs. Increasingly, SGAs have weighed in on free expression matters. Student leadership on free expression can contribute to the civic mission of higher education—building the capacity for citizens to work with those who come from different political persuasions. An example of an SGA making a positive impact on free expression include a student senate resolution at the University of Richmond that led to the university’s statement on free expression. In addition, student governments at Colgate University and Gettysburg College endorsed free expression philosophies, and this year students at the University of Nebraska passed a system-wide bill supporting freedom of the press. But other SGAs are restricting free-flowing discourse and viewpoint diversity. Here, we explore four types of free expression controversies that have confronted SGAs in the past three years, how they affect campuses, and several explanations for this phenomenon. Members of SGAs have passed resolutions or issued statements that condemn student speech or seek to regulate future expression. In May 2021, a law school SGA tried to condition funding for student groups on whether the group promoted critical race theory or related concepts in its events. The move was repealed after pressure from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which wrote that the requirement “puts student clubs in a bind” by forcing them to put on events that are unrelated or contrary to their mission. In July 2020, an SGA officially condemned a student as “ignorant” and “hateful” for writing on his personal blog that systemic racism did not exist in the United States. Heads of the College Democrats and College Republicans rebuked the resolution as student government overreach. In November 2020, SGA officials organized a protest against College Republicans and administrators after a private college’s Instagram page quoted the club president in a series about first-time voters: “there’s a space where you can support a Republican candidate without getting a side eye or without being baselessly labeled as hateful… we should be able to coexist.” At the protest, the college president apologized for the Instagram post. In November 2019, an SGA at a private university condemned the campus newspaper for following standard journalism practice. The newspaper had contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on a story about a local “Abolish ICE” protest. In September 2019, a public university SGA president and vice president issued a statement in response to a student’s private Snapchat post of a plantation gift shop with the caption, “I wonder if they sell slaves.” A student senator faced a censure vote after he criticized leadership for condemning a “crude joke.” Student governments often credential new student organizations, a process known as “recognition.” Recognition provides clubs with funding, access to campus-wide email, a slot on&hellip;",

    "content": "The pause on student loan payments and interest has provided needed relief for borrowers amidst the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, the pause is scheduled to conclude on January 31, 2022; Democrats have proposed extending the pause at least through March 2022 in order to provide additional breathing room for borrowers, while Republicans have pushed for payments to resume as planned in order to limit the ongoing costs connected to the student loan pause—budgeted at about $85 billion over the last two fiscal years. Regardless of when payments resume, their continuation will prove difficult for some borrowers. Prior to the pandemic, nearly two out of five loans expected to be in repayment in the federally managed portfolio were either delinquent or in default. Making matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives and financial circumstances of households of color disproportionately. Black and Hispanic borrowers experience financial difficulties and default at particularly high rates. Additionally, Black and Hispanic workers were more likely than white workers to experience unemployment during the COVID-19 crisis, and their unemployment rates remain higher. In order to facilitate the transition back into repayment—for all borrowers, and especially those who are struggling financially—the Department of Education should provide clear information about the return of student loan obligations and proactively offer borrowers repayment options designed to minimize financial distress. The Department of Education and loan servicers should notify all borrowers of their balances and payment schedules well ahead of the reinstatement, as borrowers may need time to adjust their budgets or make household decisions to manage reentering repayment. In this transition, many borrowers would benefit from enrollment in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. As opposed to the standard, 10-year plan with a fixed monthly payment, IDR plans tie payments to a portion of a borrower’s discretionary income. Unfortunately, the current array of IDR plans can make it challenging for borrowers to determine which one is in their best interest. Moreover, enrollment in IDR is often burdensome for borrowers, requiring significant paperwork, including annual income verification. Despite the flexibility offered by IDR plans, less than half of borrowers in repayment are enrolled in an IDR option. To ensure borrowers have easy access to affordable monthly payments, BPC’s Task Force on Higher Education Financing and Student Outcomes endorsed providing borrowers with a single IDR plan, making it the default repayment plan, and allowing for automatic income verification through data-sharing—changes that would put downward pressure on default and delinquency rates. There is bipartisan momentum in Congress behind these reforms, including the Repay Act, co-sponsored by Sens. Angus King (I-ME) and Richard Burr (R-NC), that would consolidate IDR plans and simplify the repayment process for borrowers. Short of these actions, however, as borrowers return to repayment, the Department of Education should facilitate access to IDR by emphasizing it as an option and streamlining the approval process as much as possible.

    "content": "The broadband divide is one of the more confounding issues US policymakers have attempted to solve over the last several years. Billions of federal dollars have been used trying to connect the last 14.5 million unconnected households to the internet, with little success to show for it. While the conversation is typically focused on bringing high-speed internet to the most rural homes in America, the digital divide is just as great in our cities. According to a 2018 American Community Survey, 13.7% of urban households have no fixed connection to the internet, while 18.7% of households in rural America share the same lack of connectivity. This is not meant to diminish the need for solutions to either problem but illustrates that the digital divide is not monomorphic. Solutions are needed for both urban and rural households, and due to the drastic geographical differences, the solutions will most likely look very different. Policymakers have been attempting to solve the issue by utilizing wired broadband. Over the past decade, billions have been spent in an attempt to bridge that divide, with billions in additional Covid funds having been designated for broadband and internet connectivity solutions. In addition to the billions already spent, estimates to bring high-speed wired broadband to the entire US are staggering. Industry advocates say it could cost anywhere between $20 and $350 billion to build a nationwide modern fixed network. Such varied estimates exist due to multiple technologies that could theoretically be utilized for the build-out, as well as noisy and misleading broadband coverage maps from the FCC. Combined, these issues make the process uncommonly opaque. The dominant technology planned as part of most broadband infrastructure plans is the wired broadband that will be used to connect 80-90% of US households, or between 97 and 110 million households (of 122 million total US households). For moderate costs, wired cable or fiber technologies can be brought to the majority of households. However, the primary issue still exists of significant divides on the periphery. That periphery is where several fixed wireless broadband technologies could make inroads that have made considerable progress in recent years. Satellite Internet Some may view satellite internet as the internet of the future or as science fiction, but that would ignore the increasingly positive effects that satellite internet is already delivering for users. What makes the new generation of satellite internet possible is an array of satellites launched into low-earth orbit (LEO) that form “megaconstellations” and connect the internet signal from the internet service provider (ISP) to the user’s device. Not only can this service theoretically connect to some of the planet’s most remote areas once enough satellites are put into orbit, but download speeds have already shown to be over 100Mbps with acceptably low latency between 29-41ms. This performance would be more than adequate for remote education, telehealth, and other streaming required events. As additional satellites are launched, improvements are expected in the product.

    "content": "Workers need child care. Without it, employees with young children may reduce their hours and productivity or leave the workforce altogether. More than half (57%) of parents said child care responsibilities impacted their ability to work over the last month. Businesses have a vested interest in ensuring their staff can access and afford child care: when companies offer child care benefits, they see increased employee retention and loyalty, improved productivity, and a better workplace environment. Despite the clear advantages, 2020 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates just 11% of all workers have access to employer-provided child care, and those with lower incomes were less likely to receive a benefit. To encourage businesses to provide child care to their employees, the federal government offers companies a tax credit to help cover some of the associated costs.1 The Employer-Provided Child Care Credit, under the Internal Revenue Code Section 45F, offers employers a tax credit of up to 25% of qualified child care expenditures and 10% of qualified child care resource and referral expenditures, both detailed below. The credit is capped at $150,000, meaning employers would have to spend $600,000 on qualified child care expenditures to receive the full credit, and any further spending exceeding that amount would not be reimbursed.2 Qualified child care expenditures include costs associated with acquiring, constructing, rehabilitating, or expanding property to be used as part of a child care facility, and for the operating costs of such a facility, including supporting child care workers through training, scholarships, and wages. Though it is often called the “Child Care Facilities Credit,” employers may also contract with licensed child care programs, including home-based providers, in addition to operating on-site child care facilities, to offer child care services to their employees. Businesses often partner with child care companies such as the Learning Care Group, Bright Horizons, and KinderCare to offer this benefit. Additionally, any amount paid under a contract to help employees find child care is considered a qualified resource and referral expenditure. These services must be accessible to all employees and cannot favor those who make higher wages or by ranking within the company. Not much recent information is available about the employers or employees who benefit from this credit. In 2013, the most recent year for which data are available for the take-up of the credit, employers claimed $16.7 million in associated child care costs, representing just around 0.02% of all general business tax credits claimed for the year. The companies who used the credit the most were in the fields of finance, information, and manufacturing. This low take-up rate helps reflect the limited child care assistance provided by employers in general. Given how little recent data is available, Congress requested in July 2020 that the GAO to evaluate the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit and submit a report including characteristics of employers and employees receiving the credit, challenges employers cited for not using the credit, how employees benefit when their employers use the credit, and recommendations.

    "content": "On June 2, 2021 Reps. Zoe Logfren (D- CA) and John Curtis (R-UT) introduced the bipartisan Equal Access to Green Cards for Legal Employment (EAGLE) Act of 2021 to strengthen the temporary H-1B high-skilled visa, remove certain restrictions on green cards for employment-based visas, and make it easier for employers to hire foreign workers based on merit rather than nationality. Congress has attempted and failed to pass legal immigration reform to modernize America’s high-skilled immigration in the past. In fact, the EAGLE Act is the reintroduced version of the Senate amended Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act (H.R 1044) which unanimously passed the Senate in 2020. The Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act was a popular bipartisan attempt to reform America’s legal immigration that passed the House in 2019 by a significant margin and passed the Senate on a voice vote, with amendments. However, the House and the Senate never reconciled their versions and the bill lost momentum while the Senate amendments caused some opposition to the bill. Other attempts have also been underway to repair U.S.’ broken legal immigration system. Earlier this year, Congress introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act (USCA) of 2021 in both the House and the Senate, an attempt at a comprehensive immigration reform based on the Biden administration’s proposal. The USCA proposes similar legislative changes that ease employment-based immigration. However, it lacks reforms of the temporary high-skilled visa system. While the verdict is still out on whether Congress can successfully pass comprehensive immigration packages, BPC suggests that stand-alone bipartisan bills, such as the EAGLE Act, can be effective vehicles to reform the country’s broken employment-based immigration system. The EAGLE Act, like USCA, proposes to eliminate the 7% per country cap on employment-based green cards. The 7% per country cap, instituted in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, continues to be a hurdle for immigrants from certain large countries that have higher applications for green cards. Nationals of India and China face unprecedented backlogs in accessing permanent residency in the United States due to these caps. For example, Indians have the highest backlog of any nationality with approximately 800,000 petitions and an estimated wait for a green card in the EB-2 and EB-3 categories of 89 years. These bills aim to make it easier for foreign workers to access green cards, regardless of their country of birth, albeit in diverse ways. The USCA and the EAGLE Act would protect dependent children of H-1B visa holders from “aging out” of status due to back logs by ensuring that children of H-1B workers remain eligible for a green card regardless of their age. The “aging out” of dependent children of H-1B visa holders has been a major concern for many immigrants. Currently, children of foreign workers, who are dependent of their parents’ temporary visas, are at a risk of aging out of eligibility once they turn 21. If an immigrant visa is not available on time, then the dependent child is required to convert to another nonimmigrant status or&hellip;",

    "content": "Among the many economic disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the troubling rise in long-term unemployment stands out due to its lasting effects on individual careers and the economy. In particular, the number of Americans unemployed for at least 27 weeks rose by 3.1 million during the pandemic. Moreover, despite 9.3 million unfilled jobs today, long-term unemployment remains elevated. To better understand this issue, it is important to examine the trend, the consequences for workers, and the ongoing impediments to reemploying workers. Early on, pandemic-related shutdowns of economic activity led to millions of people rapidly losing their jobs with few options to return to work. Although the economic contraction was brief, serious restrictions on business operations remained for well over a year, contributing to a marked rise in long-term unemployment. The number of Americans unemployed for at least 27 weeks rose from 1.1 million (19% of unemployed workers) in February 2020 to 4.2 million (43% of unemployed workers) in March 2021. Long-term unemployment has since declined to 4 million in June 2021, corresponding with the rise in vaccination rates and the loosening of social distancing requirements. The relatively rapid rise in long-term unemployment over just one year is unique, in comparison to prior downturns. Typically, long-term unemployment rises in response to deep and sustained recessions that result in slow labor market recoveries. During the Great Recession, for instance, long-term unemployment rose from 1.3 million (17% of unemployed workers) in December 2007 to 6.8 million (44% of unemployed workers) in April 2010. Of note, the labor market recovery from the Great Recession was much slower than the recovery from the pandemic. After the end of the Great Recession in June 2009, the unemployment rate took five years to reach 6.1%. By comparison, the unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in April 2021, just one year after reaching a historic high of 14.8% in April 2020. Today’s situation is even more troubling than the long-term unemployment figures indicate. Labor force participation is notably lower than it was pre-crisis, as many workers opted to leave the workforce all together instead of continuing to seek employment. Specifically, the labor force participation rate sharply declined by 3.1 percentage points in just two months (from 63.3% in February to 60.2% in April 2020). Although the participation rate partially rebounded during the summer of 2020, it has since stagnated and, as of June 2021, remains 1.7 percentage points below the pre-pandemic rate. While not technically classified as unemployed, these are largely people who would otherwise be working (absent the events of the past 15 months), and public policy should be crafted with them in mind, as well. A spell of long-term unemployment can financially scar a worker for the rest of their career. The Congressional Budget Office notes that long-term unemployment is associated with losing skills, such as those related to technical aspects of an occupation. It can also harm a worker’s productive value in other ways by, for example, cutting them off from their professional networks. Making matters worse, employers are less likely to hire individuals with long spells of unemployment, due to a stigma that workers who have been jobless for long periods are poor performing. One study found that the chances a worker receives a callback for a job interview declines with the duration of the period of unemployment, with most of that decline&hellip;",

    "content": "Proposals to increase the national minimum wage have emerged from both sides of the aisle: A few prominent Senate Republicans proposed a $10/hour minimum wage, while a $15/hour minimum wage has been a common goal of the Democratic party. In a more targeted approach, President Biden’s American Families Plan proposed increasing wages for all employees in Pre-K, Head Start, and child care programs. There is no doubt that the early childhood education workforce is severely underpaid and that something urgently needs to change. The median hourly pay for child care workers was $12.24 per hour, or $25,460 per year in 2020, below the current federal poverty level of $26,200 for a family of four. This under compensation has long been unacceptable for a workforce that is educating our nation’s children and serving as a backbone to our economy by making it possible for so many parents to go to work. Consequently, national discussions concerning raising the minimum wage are of great interest for the child care workforce and providers and could have significant impacts on them. While an increase to the minimum wage would improve salaries for early childhood educators, it would challenge the child care business model as child care businesses operate under slim margins. Below is an update to our 2019 analysis, describing how the potential effects of a minimum wage increase underscore key structural flaws in the child care market that must be addressed in conjunction with such wage increases. Without a clear plan on where funding for these wage increases would come from, policymakers should not overlook that there are possible unintended impacts on the child care workforce, providers, and parents. As we wrote previously, changes in the federal minimum wage could have far-reaching implications for the cost of child care. Many studies have shown that increasing the minimum wage would impact small businesses differently than large corporations. This would be particularly true for child care businesses. For these reasons, it is critical to understand the potential domino effect of an increased federal minimum wage and how higher labor costs might be passed on to parents, who are already struggling to afford child care. Understanding these impacts from the outset and developing a plan to address them could help minimize these unintended cascading effects. As it stands, two-thirds of parents report they are unable to pay more than $200 per child per week, or $10,400/year, for child care, including more than a quarter (27%) of parents who said the most they could afford was $100 per week and 12% saying they can afford nothing at all. Before a minimum wage increase is implemented, policymakers should consider how to support the child care sector on a longer-term basis so providers are not forced to pass along increased costs to parents, who are already paying a high price. Current Landscape. To better understand how minimum wage increases might impact the child care industry, we have compiled the varied levels at which states set their minimum wages, how those wages have changed from 2019 to 2021,&hellip;",

    "content": "The pandemic forced many families to adapt to new work environments and structures, highlighting the flexibility of many workplaces. At the same time, it uprooted an already unstable child care system and disrupted the care many parents rely on no matter where they work from, underscoring the fragility of the system in adapting to change. As we enter the recovery phase, it will be important to understand how work settings are changing and the impact that has on child care demands, especially in the wake of a pandemic that will have a continued impact on the future of work. In May of 2021, BPC and Morning Consult conducted a survey of 800 households with children under the age of 5 where all caregivers were employed. This is part of a series of surveys to better understand parents’ child care needs and preferences. This latest survey focused on how child care arrangements may change as parents return to work. Below are some key take-aways from the survey. Understanding the future of work and how parents and employers will navigate remote work options post-pandemic could have major implications for how parents make choices about their child care. This survey asked parents about their current and preferred work arrangements moving forward to measure what this could look like. A majority (58%) of parents are currently able to work at least a portion of their week remotely, and most are taking advantage of this: just 15% of parents say they are working onsite or in the office full-time while 81% of parents who can work remotely are remote at least some of the time. Q: Does your employer currently allow you to work any portion of the work week remotely? Looking ahead, 60% of parents say they want to work remotely at least part of the week, including 29% who wish to work remotely full-time. Parents are also most likely to prefer the work situation that they are currently in. Complicating child care needs, more than one-quarter (29%) of parents report they are made aware of their work schedules no more than 2 weeks in advance. Black parents, parents with low educational attainment, and those who earn less than $50,000 are more likely to be made aware of their work schedule no more than 2 weeks ahead of time. In-line with our previous surveys, we asked parents to report on the status of their child’s current learning situation. One in ten parents reported their child care provider had closed permanently, largely unchanged from our last survey conducted in December 2020, in which 11% of parents said the same. While this survey is not longitudinal, the equivalent findings strongly indicate as many as one in ten child care programs have permanently closed due to the pandemic. Currently, 29% of parents report the child care arrangement they had at the start of the pandemic was open without any changes to hours or capacity. 15% report their provider is still temporarily closed. 19% of programs are open&hellip;",

    "content": "When it comes to child care, there is no one size fits all approach. Parental decisions about child care are a balance, taking into consideration affordability, what type of care parents prefer and children thrive within, parent work hours, and location. For these reasons, a mixed delivery system that supports Pre-K and other early education programs in community-based, child care settings provide optimal parental choice and foundational supports to strengthen child care programs. Some states have adopted mixed delivery systems to implement early care and education programs. They achieve multiple goals at once: preserve parent choice and streamline funding. For families, a mixed delivery system allows parents to choose among different program types and select one that best meets their needs, and children can participate in a program that meets their development and learning style. For early learning providers, a mixed delivery system increases fiscal stability by allowing multiple funding streams to support it. Mixed delivery systems are structured to enable some—or all—publicly-funded Pre-K slots to be offered in diverse settings that meet health, safety, and performance standards. For example, in a mixed delivery system, Pre-K slots are offered in child care programs, including center-based child care and family child care homes, that operate for a full day and full year. This means that a variety of settings can meet a parent’s needs for child care that aligns with their work hours. Below we describe four states that have successfully implemented a mixed delivery model that supports parental choice and efficiencies within a blended funding system for child care programs. Each of these states have evaluated their approaches and links to the evaluations are provided. Washington Washington policymakers passed the Early Start Act in 2015, and unified early childhood state agencies and prioritized integrated services between the state’s child care subsidy program and the state’s Pre-K program, the Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, or ECEAP. ECEAP serves 3- and 4-year-old children in a variety of settings for families at or below 110% the federal poverty level or children on an Individualized Education Program. Some families over the income limit may also qualify. During the 2019-20 school year, ECEAP provided 14,000 children access to Pre-K at more than 390 sites in school districts, center-based child care programs, and family child care. ECEAP is managed through 54 contracts with school districts, child care programs, educational service districts, community colleges, local governments, tribal organizations, and nonprofits. Additionally, Washington is piloting a companion program, called Early ECEAP, for children birth to 3 years old. Both ECEAP and Early ECEAP are modeled after Head Start, providing comprehensive services in a two-generational model, in addition to full-day, full-year slots for young children. Strengths: By partnering two programs—ECEAP and Early ECEAP—Washington provides full-day, full-year services for working families in accessible settings. The companion programs also provide continuity in care for children, as children can transition into ECEAP as they reach preschool age.

    "content": "Businesses are recognizing the need to promote the health and well-being of their employees and the communities they serve now more than ever. There is no better example of this than the COVID-19 pandemic, during which business operations have taken unprecedented steps to partner with public health and clinical organizations to support the pandemic response. Yet, many of these actions may be temporary. The health and business sectors have a critical opportunity to build on the momentum sparked by the COVID-19 crisis to create more sustainable partnerships and initiatives to promote health. The business community can and should be a force for promoting the health of its employees and communities over the long term. The ways in which businesses have rallied during COVID-19, finding innovative ways to support the pandemic response, have highlighted why businesses should be invested in public health. Over the past year, some corporations contributed infrastructure, technology, or production line capacity to support the manufacturing and distribution of critical supplies. For example, several automotive companies, including Ford and General Motors, partnered with health care organizations to manufacture ventilators. In Washington state, Providence St. Joseph Health partnered with a local furniture factory to produce personal protective equipment for health care workers. Other companies lent their expertise to improve coordination or operations for testing and vaccination. Silicon Slopes, a group of startups and technology organizations in Utah, provided technological support to the state government to increase testing capacity. In North Carolina, Honeywell has been leading a public-private partnership with the state to support vaccination, with plans to set up vaccination sites in sports stadiums. The Biden administration recently acted to encourage even greater participation of corporations in the pandemic response. On February 26, 2021, the administration announced a new partnership with major corporations and business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, and other business leaders. Through the new partnership, the Biden administration enlisted the help of corporations in promoting safe public health practices, boosting public health messaging, and improving access to vaccination. Under this effort, companies committed to providing employees with paid time off to get the vaccine, as well as developing novel ways to lend their expertise to the cause. The pandemic makes clear why businesses have a vested interest in the health of their employees, consumers, and communities. Yet this was true before the pandemic, too, and it will remain true after the emergency subsides. Public health and the economy are closely linked. In 2016, chronic diseases among Americans were estimated to cost $2.6 trillion in lost economic productivity. Businesses suffer without healthy workers and a healthy customer base to buy their products and services. Alternatively, they can attract consumers and loyal employees by demonstrating their company’s commitment to health and well-being. While the mobilization of the business community during COVID-19 has been encouraging, businesses have an important role in promoting health during non-emergencies, as well. Private companies have the money, resources, and staffing to elevate public health&hellip;",

    "content": "Given President Biden’s recent Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk1, and in particular, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) request for public input, the stated policy goal of regulating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) disclosures, including climate-related data, is an attempt at providing investors and other stakeholders with consistent, comparable, and reliable data that may be used to make informed investment decisions. Whether disclosure of ESG data, or specifically climate-related data, continues to be under a voluntary principles-based approach, is yet to be determined. While financially material information is already required to be disclosed under existing SEC regulations, and 90% of S&#038;P 500 companies produced suitability reports, consistency and comparability of that data is driving the disclosure issue. Disclosure is at the core of ESG issues. While what encompasses ESG is for a different discussion, assuming the “what” is determined, the difficult question for companies then becomes “how” to disclose their ESG data. Specifically, what standards and frameworks to use and whether the metrics used adequately represent an individual company&#8217;s assessment of relevant disclosure material? There are several different standard and framework setters including those created by government agencies, non-profits, and industry-developed. Who are the leading standard and framework setters and what is their role in providing relevant information to the public? Historically, sustainability issues, sometimes including such terms as “corporate social responsibility,” were relegated to what has been referred to as &#8220;impact-investors.&#8221; These investors wanted their investments to have an impact on the issues they thought important. Then, as concerns about climate change increased, large institutional investors, such as BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard started asking for more ESG-type information from companies. This resulted in companies compiling sustainability reports. These sustainability reports often included qualitative data unique to the individual company. Additionally, the broader investment community and stakeholders were interested in comparing data between companies as well as data on how companies were impacting the environment. This brings us to the standard and framework setters who had already begun to establish principles and templates for disclosure. Over the years there have been many broad-based standards and frameworks contemplated, but the &#8220;Group of Five&#8221; (Group) have been the most widely used and are now collaborating on certain issues. The Group includes: The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); CDP (formerly, the “Carbon Disclosure Project”); The Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB); The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC); and The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). While the Group has different approaches to their standards and reporting, there is overlap that they, as a group, consider complementary. This overlap can be seen in the brief description of each. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an international organization created in 1997 to ensure companies follow certain environmental conduct principles. Originally, it provided guidelines for sustainability and then in 2016 transitioned to produce global standards on various topics. Today, its purpose is to assist organizations and government entities evaluate, and ultimately communicate, the impacts they have on the broader environment.

    "content": "Rep. Paul Tonko (left) and Rep. David McKinley learn about clean energy technology research with engineering students at West Virginia University. The two congressmen visited CSX and Appalachian &amp; Ohio Railroad freight operations in Grafton, WV. Rep. Paul Tonko (far left) and Rep. David McKinley (3rd from left) met with chemical plant and natural gas refiners in the large industrial complex of the Ohio River valley. The two congressmen received a briefing at Cleveland Cliffs Weirton Steel operation along with the United Steelworker union. The uneven and steep terrain of West Virginia is a metaphor for an economy that has been reliant on mineral markets and prices to provide the raw materials for the nation’s manufacturing might. When demand and prices have been high, West Virginia prospered. But when markets crashed or labor strife occurred, the state’s dependency on a fossil-based economy was exposed. Shaped by ancient geological forces, West Virginia literally has an underground economy that, starting in the late 1800s, began to extract coal, oil, natural gas, and timber to fuel the American industrial revolution. Railroads expanded their trackage in the state after the Civil War, and mines were able distribute their “black gold” to steel mills, power plants, and other destinations for succeeding decades. But today, West Virginia sits at a crossroads. With the state’s Marcellus Shale play still holding substantial recoverable resources, particularly in natural gas but also coal, the region faces a nation deeply concerned about the environmental externalities of mining, fracking, and the emissions from burning these minerals. Uncertainties in the energy regulatory framework and a push to move the country’s energy usage to cleaner, renewable resources is causing an economic and social upheaval in the Mountain State. Into this conundrum journeyed the American Congressional Exchange (ACE) this spring, where Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY-20), who represents New York’s Albany-Schenectady and Hudson/Mohawk River valley areas, visited David McKinley (R-WV-1) in northern West Virginia. Each district has a long tradition of manufacturing and a keen understanding of the power requirements to electrify industrial output. Moreover, both members serve on the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee and Tonko and McKinley are chair and ranking member, respectively, of the Environment &#038; Climate Change Subcommittee. Although these two veteran lawmakers have worked together and found common ground on some energy issues, Tonko had never visited West Virginia. The congressman from Wheeling, WV is a 7th generation McKinley and distantly related to our 25th President. Both McKinley and Tonko served in their states’ legislatures and are certified engineers; McKinley established a successful architectural and engineering practice while Tonko spent his early career in energy policy in New York State agencies. This ACE trip found us oscillating between hopeful technologies in newer economies and the isolated, challenged areas where understandable fears and deep frustration pervade the communities. Yet, in all the places we visited with the two congressmen, there remains a strong identity and attachment to the rough-hewn landscape and the independent spirit that was first evoked in 1861 when&hellip;",

    "content": "Our economy is starting to show signs of life, but is still not meeting hopes and expectations for a big bounce back. The main challenge, as evidenced by the latest jobs report, is that labor force participation remains stagnant, and people are not entering the workforce. This leaves companies struggling to hire, and our economic recovery stifled. While there are many contributing factors, one distinct reason is a lack of agency in how to balance their work and caregiving responsibilities caused by a nonexistent care infrastructure around our country. Our nation’s caregiving structure was a house of cards prior to the pandemic, and it is in no way set up to provide the flexibility families need as they seek to return to work. To support rehiring and reentry into the workforce, we must institute long-lasting family- and business-friendly policies that help our economy, and our families, get back on track. Every day, parents make important decisions about who is caring for their children—whether they can provide that care themselves, or if they will rely on the help of a family member, friend, or a child care professional. While some parents would prefer to stay at home during their child’s earliest years, for many, this is simply not an option. Prior to the pandemic, more than two-thirds of children under the age of five had all available parents in the workforce, and women made up a majority of workers. These parents, working either out of necessity or choice, had the rug pulled out from under them during the pandemic. Since 2020, mothers with young children have left the workforce in staggering numbers. The United States is the only OECD country that does not offer paid maternity leave, and one of only two that does not offer paid paternity leave. We also rank among the bottom three OECD countries in terms of public expenditures on early care and education. This results in just 20% of all workers having access to parental or family caregiving leave, including just 9% of workers in the lowest income quartile. And as many as one in three young children with working parents may lack access to child care in their communities, a gap which is especially pronounced in rural areas, while the high cost can be prohibitive for many families, particularly those with the lowest incomes. This leaves parents without the flexibility they needed to make the right decisions for themselves and their family. It has also caused companies to clamor for qualified workers. This reality will have long-lasting implications on our economic strength and on the health and success of families. A new analysis by the US Chamber of Commerce found the inability to hire qualified workers is the most critical and widespread challenge businesses are facing. Over 90% of state and local chambers of commerce say worker shortages are holding back their economies, and in several states and industries, including education and health services, there are fewer available workers than available jobs.

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center recently conducted a survey with Morning Consult on issues in higher education, including student debt forgiveness and free college. The survey’s results suggest widespread concern about college affordability but a lack of consensus on how to best address this challenge. Bold plans to cancel student loan debt receive lots of airtime, but public opinion is split who should qualify—or even if—the federal government should intervene. 67% of adults support some level of student debt relief, with a quarter of those polled (24%) supporting full cancellation and 20% against any loans forgiveness. Republicans are significantly more likely (40%) to oppose the federal government forgiving student debt than Democrats (4%). When considering a range of options for loan forgiveness, however, stronger support exists (41%) for some sort of loan forgiveness that benefits all borrowers, compared to debt cancellation that only targets low-income borrowers (27%). Unsurprisingly, respondents with student debt are more in favor of forgiving all student debt (48%) than respondents without debt (20%), but public opinion did not vary significantly by education level. Public servants, such as teachers, first responders, and social workers, occupy roles that often require a college degree but offer only modest wages. Just prior to the pandemic, BPC polled on whether the federal government should help these types of borrowers pay off their loans, with 57% of respondents in favor. More than a year later—after many public servants worked on the front lines during the crisis—support for public service borrowers has grown by seven percentage points, to 64%. Despite broad approval, Democrats are significantly more likely (82%) to favor providing student loan assistance to public servants than Republicans (45%). Those who are currently enrolled in college—or expect to enroll in the next two years—indicate overwhelming (87%) support for this idea. Across generations, a majority of respondents also responded favorably. Millennials were the most supportive (77%), while only 52% of Baby Boomers agreed public servants should receive student loan support from the federal government. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is an existing program that offers loan forgiveness for public servants after 10 years of loan repayment, but a convoluted application and stringent eligibility requirements have resulted in just 2% of PSLF hopefuls seeing their loans forgiven. Given the strong support for this type of program among the general public, policymakers should consider reforms to PSLF that would enable more public servants to get help paying off their federal student loans. A majority of respondents (65%) support the federal government giving money to states to provide students with free tuition at public colleges. This high level of support is unsurprising, given that the proposal is often pitched as being “free” (even though in reality taxpayers foot the bill). Groups opposing free public college include a plurality of Republicans (48%) and adults aged 65 and over (46%). Rather than free tuition, reducing prices by having states and the federal government act together resonated more strongly among respondents. 69% of adults support the federal government providing additional&hellip;",

Local and state policymakers should think twice before diving in with unaccredited, partisan “auditors.” The Justice Department is emerging as the critical backstop against these charades, which like in Arizona, have the potential to constitute illegal security breaches of 2020 election ballots. In northern Michigan counties, enraged MAGA agitators continue the 2020 battle for ballot inspections. The attorney who injected the Cyber Ninjas into Antrim County’s elections promises free “forensic audits” to any other county in the state. So far, none has taken them up on the offer, but pressure is mounting. According to the Department of Justice all ballots and other election records must “be retained either physically by election officials themselves, or under their direct administrative supervision.” It is the Justice Department’s duty to enforce the federal election records retention law. The Justice Department should have insisted on Arizona election officials overseeing the security of the ballots. Arizona has thoroughly breached the 22-month federal retention period, throwing the chain of custody into question. The Justice Department, arriving late to the game in Arizona, curiously seems to accept the breach in federal law, which has placed Maricopa County’s election ballots in the hands of Cyber Ninjas, an Arizona State Senate contractor whose owner has a history of virulent election conspiracy advocacy. Court records reflect no discussion of the federal law during litigation over the State Senate subpoenas. Surely, with knowledge of the law, the judge could have accommodated both the Senate’s request to view ballots and the federal retention law requiring Maricopa County election officials to remain in control of the ballots. The purpose of the federal law is to ensure records are admissible in federal (civil or criminal) legal proceedings. Perhaps more important, a clean chain of custody could prove essential to refuting fanciful and unhinged conclusions generated by highly partisan contractors. Already, the contractors in Arizona are making unsubstantiated, fantastical claims that records have been destroyed or are missing, and then walking back those pronouncements much more quietly. Another unintended consequence of Arizona’s fiasco is a large, wasteful expense for Maricopa County. Last week Secretary of State Katie Hobbs informed the county that delivery of ballot tabulation equipment to the Ninjas “constitutes a cyber incident of critical infrastructure”. In consultation with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Secretary Hobbs noted the break in the chain of custody jeopardizes the integrity and use of that equipment in any future election. Decommissioning and replacing equipment is a huge monetary cost for such a flawed endeavor. When the Ninjas come calling, state election officials and the Justice Department must stop any local governments from handing over control of election ballots and equipment. It is plainly illegal to do so. The Justice Department must immediately issue a formal letter to state election officials stating the retention law requirements&hellip;",

    "content": "In March, House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&#038;I) Committee Chair Peter DeFazio (D-OR) announced that members of the House of Representatives would be able to submit funding requests for transportation projects in their districts. Also traditionally known as earmarks, these member designated projects are eligible for inclusion in the House surface transportation bill, which authorizes funding for America’s roads, public transit, and other transportation infrastructure. DeFazio introduced an initial version of the $547 billion surface transportation bill on June 4. The decision to allow specific member designated projects, which have not been included in the last two surface transportation reauthorizations, reflects BPC’s recommendation that such projects be restored, subject to appropriate safeguards around transparency and project selection. BPC’s work on earmarks suggests that they are helpful in engaging members of Congress in negotiating and advancing bipartisan legislation, as well as demonstrating tangible benefits to constituents in their districts who may be asked to pay more for transportation. In an important gain for transparency, the T&#038;I Committee posted all the member designated requests it received on its website, including the project name, amount requested, and requesting member. Between early March and the deadline of April 23, House members collectively sought 2,380 projects totaling nearly $15 billion. According to BPC’s analysis, those requests broke down as follows: Roads and bridges: The majority of requests, more than 1,300 (57%), were for roads and bridges. These projects included repaving and maintaining highways and roads, expanding and widening roads, safety improvements, and repairing and constructing bridges and overpasses. Public transit and rail: About 400 requests (17%) were for public transit and railroad projects, including maintenance, expansion, and modernization projects, as well zero-emissions bus initiatives. Pedestrian and biking: About 400 requests (17%) were for pedestrian and biking projects like sidewalks, bike lanes, trails, greenways, and wheelchair accessibility ramps. Multiple or other: About 200 requests (9%) were for projects that included multiple types of transportation modes or for other types of projects, such as those related to technology or planning. Road and bridge projects were more expensive on average, with an average cost of $7.4 million compared to averages of $5.8 million for public transit and rail projects, and $3.6 million for pedestrian and biking projects. DeFazio stated that each district would be allowed an estimated maximum of $20 million in individual member requests, and that members did not need to vote in favor of the bill to receive that funding. However, many representatives submitted requests for much more than $20 million. In fact, the ten most expensive requests, mostly highway projects, totaled over $3 billion, more than 20% of the total cost of all member requests. About three-quarters of representatives submitted requests, including about half of Republicans and nearly all Democrats. Requests came from every state except Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. While some districts requested much more than others, if the final legislation caps earmarks at an equal amount per district, there will be greater distributional parity among those that submitted requests.

    "content": "In April and May 2021, Morning Consult and the Bipartisan Policy Center conducted a two-wave survey to try and answer some critical questions around immigration reform efforts with a new administration and narrow Democratic control of Congress. Specifically, we wanted to know: what immigration policies does the public prioritize and what policies would they be willing to accept from the other side or give up from their own side, to get something done?1 Figure 1 shows the table of immigration policy priorities we asked respondents to accept or drop, based on the policies identified as most important by respondents from each party (the policy priorities were randomized for the survey). There was some overlap between the top policies identified by Democrats and Republicans. Partisanship remains strong on immigration issues and the latest BPC/Morning Consult poll aligns with other national polls showing that Democrats and Republicans differ intensely on their highest policy priorities. However, on issues that are less of a priority, there may be more openness to bipartisanship and agreement. Strategies of “piecemeal” rather than comprehensive legislation may therefore have a better chance of passage. Expanding legal immigration to support the economy and fill jobs has broad support, but current events at the border still affect overall support for immigrants. Finally, there are differences between Trump-aligned and party-aligned Republicans on these issues, suggesting there are avenues to work across the aisle on legislation.

    "content": "As America begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the housing market has been resilient. Housing demand is extremely strong and home values are rising in markets across the country, providing a significant boost to the U.S. economy. But these positive trends should not obscure a problem with major implications for homeownership access and affordability: the acute shortage of the lumber needed to build new single-family homes and apartments. This shortage has led to a dramatic spike in lumber prices, which have more than quadrupled since last Spring. Earlier this month, the price of 1,000 board feet of lumber, a basic unit of measurement in the homebuilding business, skyrocketed to an all-time high of $1,686. To put this figure in perspective: prior to the pandemic, the record high price was $582. Over the past six years, the price has typically ranged between $275 and $450. Many home builders and construction firms have been willing to take the hit to their bottom line by absorbing these price increases. Others have simply chosen to delay construction of new homes despite strong demand. We saw these delays play out earlier this year, when starts of new single-family homes dipped significantly. But this past March, new housing starts reached their highest level since 2006, demonstrating strong demand and the lack of inventory for existing homes. Looking ahead, the need for lumber to support new homebuilding will most certainly continue to grow. Not surprisingly, rising lumber costs are being reflected in overall building costs. According to the National Association of Home Builders, the cost of building an average new single-family home has increased by nearly $36,000 since April 2020 while that of the average new multifamily unit has increased by nearly $13,000 over the same period. These cost increases adversely impact consumers in the form of rising home prices. Under current economic conditions, every $1,000 increase in the median price of a new single-family home effectively excludes, or “prices out,” more than 150,000 households nationwide from the opportunity to buy that home. Members of the 75 million strong Millennial generation (those born between 1980 and 1998) make up the largest share of home buyers, so it is no surprise they are among the hardest hit by these price increases. Many are now seeking to step onto the first rung of the homeownership ladder with the goal of benefiting from the wealth-building opportunities that owning a home can provide. The recent increases in new home prices created by the lumber shortage act as a barrier to the fulfillment of these aspirations. Forty-four percent of Millennials are members of minority groups, making them more diverse than any preceding generation. So higher prices for new single-family homes disproportionately impact young Black and Hispanic households. The result will likely be a further widening of the already-enormous racial disparities in homeownership rates—the rate for whites currently exceeds that of Blacks by nearly 30 percentage points and Hispanics by nearly 25 percentage points. What’s creating today’s lumber shortage? There are a&hellip;",

    "content": "A bipartisan negotiation in the House last week encouragingly overcame some of the biggest disagreements with establishing a commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the Capitol. The deal’s arrival in the Senate has now encountered hurdles, but not insurmountable ones. Questions regarding the scope of the investigation, the composition of commissioners, and how subpoena powers could be used were the major flashpoints preventing the House from moving forward on legislation. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and Ranking Member Rep. John Katko (R-NY) reached a consensus by modeling the commission on the successful, bipartisan 9-11 commission. The House passed the agreement with a bipartisan vote of 252-175. Subsequently, Republican senators stated a belief that H.R. 3233 unfairly empowers the chairman of the commission, who would be appointed by the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate. They anticipate that a Democratic-appointed chairman will hire only Democratic-minded staff. First, it is worth noting that, with the exception of how the leaders of the commission are referred to, the language of H.R. 3233 relevant to staffing mirrors exactly that of the 9-11 commission. The House bill states: “…the Chairperson, in consultation with the Vice-Chairperson, in accordance with rules agreed upon by the Commission, may appoint and fix the compensation of a Staff Director and such other personnel as may be necessary to enable the Commission to carry out its purposes and functions…” The 9-11 Commission legislation included this virtually identical wording: “The chairman, in consultation with vice chairman, in accordance with rules agreed upon by the Commission, may appoint and fix the compensation of a staff director and such other personnel as may be necessary to enable the Commission to carry out its functions…” Additionally, the actual historical record of the highly regarded 9-11 Commission provides a template for how this arrangement should be executed. Commission Chair Gov. Tom Kean (R-NJ) and Vice Chair Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-IN), who wrote to the president and congressional leaders in February calling for a similar commission, went to painstaking lengths to vet their eventual staff together. Kean commented: recently at a Bipartisan Policy Center event: “We worked very carefully to find the right staff. We turned down numerous recommendations. I turned down recommendations from White House to start the work. Lee and I would talk about these positions and make sure that every single one of them were top quality people.” Notwithstanding the indistinguishable language on staffing between the House legislation and 9-11 and the historical operational precedent, two amendments to the House bill would provide additional concrete measures to prevent rank partisanship from permeating the commission’s staff: First, put into statute what was the informal practice of the 9-11 Commission: allow the vice chair to select the deputy staff director. In hiring the executive director, with Vice Chair Hamilton’s consultation, Chairman Kean selected a national security professional who had a long track record in Republican administrations. When it came time to hire the deputy executive director, the person selected&hellip;",

    "content": "Capital markets and financial disclosures are a key aspect of a functioning financial system and modern economy. They play a major role in the allocation of capital across the economy. Capital markets are intermediaries where financial securities are bought and sold (such as the New York Stock Exchange). Capital markets can be divided into primary and secondary capital markets. Primary capital markets are where investors buy newly issued securities from an issuer (e.g., a corporation) to help it raise capital. Issuers can use capital from primary markets to fund a variety of activities, such as paying workers, building new factories and plants, and making acquisitions. Secondary capital markets are where investors trade previously issued securities. Secondary capital markets don’t directly raise money for issuers, but they make it easier for issuers to sell securities on primary markets. This is because investors have more incentive to buy newly issued securities if they can quickly sell them at a reasonable price in secondary markets when necessary. The rest of this piece will focus on primary capital markets for corporate securities (which will just be referred to as “capital markets”), but much of this logic applies to capital markets in general. For capital markets to work well, investors need information to determine whether a company is a good investment or not. A lack of information about a company can discourage investors from buying securities in the company because they cannot properly evaluate it. It can also make investors more susceptible to deception and fraud. Financial disclosures can help provide investors with access to this information, so they can decide which companies to invest in and how to best allocate their capital. This can make the economy more efficient by directing capital towards productive and well-managed companies. Financial disclosures can include information such as a company’s cash on hand, net income, and liabilities for investors to evaluate. The federal government mandates financial disclosures from publicly traded companies to provide investors with useful information for making investment decisions and to help protect these investors from deception, fraud, and abuse. Public companies must provide certain information in these disclosures, but they have more discretion on whether to disclose other information. Deciding what information a company should disclose to investors is a balancing act. Disclosing too little information can prevent investors from adequately evaluating a company, which can lead them to underinvest or make poor investment decisions. However, disclosing too much information, can be overly burdensome to the company and overwhelm investors with excess information. Getting financial disclosures correct is important in fostering a well-functioning capital market. These disclosures can help investors determine where to invest and provide productive companies with a vital source of capital.",

    "content": "As the Senate considers the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act Of 2021, we want to highlight a critically important but little noticed provision addressing the challenge of work/life balance faced by the STEM workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a pre-existing weakness in today’s economy, namely the difficulty working parents, particularly women, have in managing professional and family life. Even before the pandemic, this predicament had been particularly troublesome in the professional field STEM (science, technology, engineering, math), where women have been historically underrepresented. The provision in the legislation requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and relevant federal agencies to issue guidance that prohibits discrimination in the awarding and administering of research grants due to an applicant having a newborn child, newly adopted child, or caregiving responsibilities for an immediate family member with a severe illness. The legislation further requires that such grants be flexible to accommodate for caregiving needs, including extensions and supplemental funding as necessary. In other words, a researcher cannot be discriminated against for taking family leave. As STEM businesses and policymakers seek answers to grow and strengthen the STEM workforce, consider this: A report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) notes that among new mothers working in STEM, over 4 in 10 leave full-time employment after having their first child, nearly double the rate of new fathers. The authors note: Even mothers who remain in the professional workforce full-time encounter stereotypes painting them as less competent than equally qualified men and childless women (33), and face salary penalties and career barriers even while contributing the same dedicated work (34–36). In addition, unlike most working fathers, many professional working mothers confront dominant cultural expectations that their children deserve their single-minded devotion—devotion presumed to be incompatible with the work dedication expected of professionals (37). As such, what may appear as professional women’s unconstrained personal choice to leave their careers to care for family is often the outcome of overdetermined, socially patterned expectations that constrain mothers more frequently than fathers (32, 38, 39). The report also adds: Importantly, our results also show that parenthood in STEM is not solely a “mother’s issue.” Both new mothers and new fathers are significantly more likely to leave full-time STEM work than their similar childless peers. Seventy percent of new mothers and 95% of new fathers continued working full-time in 2010, yet a sizeable proportion of these new parents left STEM for a full-time job elsewhere. This suggests that it is not necessarily full-time work per se, but full-time work in STEM fields particularly, that is difficult for new parents to combine with childcare responsibilities. Of course, the solution is not to encourage STEM professionals to avoid parenthood altogether or to advise young adults with family plans to avoid STEM careers. Rather, the concerning levels of attrition of new fathers and mothers mandates the need for legislative, organizational, and cultural changes. This is solid advice, and consistent with a recent Morning Consult -BPC poll&hellip;",

    "content": "President Biden’s domestic infrastructure and jobs plans emphasizes a massive, unprecedented clean energy transition. Media coverage has perhaps understandably focused almost entirely on the high levels of public spending in the plans. But as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen noted recently, the main purpose of federal policy is to stimulate private sector investments which will represent the lion’s share of capital flowing into clean energy in the decades ahead. The goal of most public direct investment, incentives, and tax policies is not to build the clean energy economy of the future by the government. Rather it is to create the conditions so the private sector can build the world class system America needs to be competitive. This focus on unleashing private sector investment must be at the center of the infrastructure policy agenda, and Democrats must emphasize it more forcefully to gain Republican support. Fortunately, American businesses of all types are rapidly becoming convinced of the value proposition in clean energy. From United Airlines’ commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, to General Motor’s shift to an all-electric vehicle fleet, to ExxonMobil’s new plan to build a massive carbon management cluster near Houston, the movement by the mainstream business and financial community toward a climate-forward, low-carbon business model is striking. The question now is can Congress write a bipartisan bill that unleashes U.S. private investment and makes these business goals commercially viable. As a former energy project developer during the initial clean technology push a decade ago, I can attest that the commercial landscape is far more dynamic today. In the previous boom, there were innovative projects desperately seeking capital, which was scarce and expensive. Today, the situation has matured so there is an abundance of capital chasing clean technology projects. Yet the rising investment demand for clean energy opportunities is creating a “pile up” of dollars, suggesting that while some elements for climate-focused investment are aligning, conditions are still not quite right for transformational change. The central role of the government now should be to help unleash this pent-up cash. Government has not acted sufficiently in part because there remains confusion and disagreement on Capitol Hill and elsewhere about how decarbonization can be accomplished. Arguments from the left suggesting government should take on the responsibility of decarbonization—and contentions from the right that the private sector can do it alone—both miss the mark. Experience in both policy and industry suggests success is only possible if government works in close collaboration with the business community, designing policies that enable private investors to deploy their capital into financially attractive investments. For one thing, the public sector cannot invest directly at scale to build and operate all the infrastructure that is needed for net-zero by 2050. Energy is one of the largest economic sectors in the world, and public resources simply cannot do it all, fast enough, with the requisite entrepreneurism and risk tolerance to meet our climate goals. Nor are governments able to rapidly adapt to changing market opportunities, competition, and technological evolution. At&hellip;",

    "content": "Our readings include four bills passed by state legislatures in the past month and a higher education report under consideration by a fifth. These bills range from proscriptions of certain curricular content to surveying campuses about viewpoint diversity. Since 2017, 26 states have passed legislation concerning free expression on campus. Tenured Professor Abruptly Fired After Raising Allegations of Anti-Semitic Speech by Linfield University’s President Press Release | Foundation for Individual Rights in Education | April 29, 2021 “A university embroiled in sexual abuse scandals has abruptly fired a tenured professor who criticized the handling of those controversies and alleged that the university’s president and chair of its board of trustees made anti-Semitic comments.” In response to the professor’s allegations, posted on Twitter, administrators shut down a faculty email listserv and informed the professor that he was terminated for “ false and defamatory statements.” Administrators responded to concerns that the move violated faculty handbook protocol, saying they were not aware the handbook had been updated to afford protections for tenured employees. A trustee has resigned in protest. A Troublesome Year Leads to President’s Firing Greta Anderson | Inside Higher Ed | May 14, 2021 The Bureau of Indian Education removed the president of Haskell Indian Nations University, Ronald Graham, amid allegations that he suppressed student speech after he “sent a threatening ‘directive’ to Jared Nally, editor in chief of Haskell&#8217;s student newspaper, The Indian Leader. Graham ordered Nally to stop routine reporting activities and threatened to impose sanctions&#8230; Graham sent a similar ‘directive’ to Haskell faculty members in March, which said employees may not engage in ‘defaming, slanderous, damaging and inflammatory’ behavior and said ‘derogatory opinions’ about administrators are not protected by academic freedom.” West Virginia Senate Bill 657 West Virginia 85th Legislature | April 26, 2021 The legislation requires higher education institutions to treat student organizations equally, and mandates that public universities develop free speech education materials, clearly post speech policies, and report “a description of any barriers to, or incidents of disruption of, free expression occurring on campus” to a state commission. The law prohibits free speech zones but allows for time, place, and manner restrictions of speech that disrupts the functioning of campus. Violations may be remedied through court action against the institution and its employees in their official capacity. Gov. Jim Justice (R-WV) signed the legislation into law in April. North Dakota Senate Bill 2030 North Dakota 67th Legislative Assembly | April 27, 2021 In order to receive funds under North Dakota’s matching grant program, higher education institutions must certify that they are unaffiliated with any person or organization that performs or promotes abortions not used to save the mother’s life. This includes “sponsoring any program producing, distributing, publishing, disseminating, endorsing, or approving materials of any type or from any organization which&#8230; do not give preference, encouragement, and support to normal childbirth.” Violators are subject to lose nearly $3 million in state funds.

    "content": "This is part of BPC’s ongoing series on broadband policy and the digital divide. The President’s infrastructure plan and recent COVID relief funds have designated billions for connecting Americans to the internet. Covid-19 has only increased the need to address the digital divide. In March of 2020, as Americans shifted to remote work and education, the average daily broadband usage jumped 41% to 6.3 GB per user during office hours. Every month, American families use over 344 GB of data, roughly 38 times the rate they were using ten years ago. Estimates indicate that over 19 million Americans do not have broadband access or are underserved in their internet connection. It is important to designate the differences between a wired broadband connection and a wireless broadband connection in looking at these issues. The “Last Mile Connection” determines the speed by which regions have access to the internet. This blog will talk specifically about the Last Mile wired connections and the speeds that they provide customers who use them. We hope that this information will help inform Congress and the public on their options for accessing high-speed internet and deciding how to allocate government broadband funds. We have also detailed the need for Congress to utilize wireless broadband connections. Each of the technologies covered in this blog will have two speed ranges- the download and the upload speeds. Download speeds indicate how fast data can be downloaded to a computer from the internet. Because downloading information to a computer has typically been the model needed to interact with the internet, these speeds are significantly higher than the upload speeds. To stream a YouTube clip in HD a device needs at least 5 Mbps. Upload speeds have become a significant factor in modern internet applications because they impact the data sent to the network, including any video connections for remote education or work situations. In addition, cloud-based document editing with multiple users will also use a large percentage of a connection’s upload bandwidth. Symmetrical upload and download times mean that data travels at the same speed in either direction. Proposals to “future-proof” broadband suggest high-speed symmetrical bandwidth. Types of Wired Broadband Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)- Download speeds-5-35 Megabits Per Second (Mbps); Upload speeds 1-10 Mbps DSL transmits data over traditional copper telephone lines already installed to homes and businesses. It is typically considered the slowest of modern internet connections. DSL-based broadband provides internet transmission speeds ranging from 5 Mbps to 35 Mbps. In some cases, DSL can reach download speeds of over 100 Mbps. The availability and speed of DSL services depend on the distance from a home or business to the closest telephone company facility, making it a slower option for rural areas. For that reason, DSL providers do not guarantee the speeds that they advertise. The upload speeds of DSL are significantly lower than the alternative connections. They typically range between 1-10 Mbps. Because DSL has been around the longest, it is the most available form of wired internet connection.&hellip;",

    "content": "The dynamic among freedoms enjoyed by professors as scholars, educators, and citizens has been in tension for well over a century, leading the academic community to refine these boundaries in times of uncertainty. Under the principle of academic freedom, professors can conduct research, even in areas fraught with controversy, manage their classrooms according to their judgement, participate in college governance, and express themselves as private citizens. The meaning of academic freedom for faculty is sometimes contested in campus settings when scholarship, classroom conduct, and governance leads to controversy. But perhaps even more frequent are debates about the meaning of academic freedom outside the university gates. Though they are members of an institution, professors are also citizens with First Amendment rights. Comments, publications, or actions carried out by professors external to their positions with their universities has led to controversy in recent years, although the phenomenon is nothing new. Is it acceptable for faculty to take off their professorial caps and speak their mind freely, like any other citizen, or must faculty exercise unremitting self-restraint and decorum in the content and tone of extramural statements? Likewise, what is the role, if any, of the university in responding to faculty extramural expression? The rise of online expression has increased uncertainty about the bounds of academic freedom. Over the past century, the rules and mores governing academic institutions have been reshaped several times. These episodes provide context for how campus leaders should engage with our current upheaval. Events in the early 20th century helped set the stage for formal statements on extramural expression. Ross Affair (1900) Edward Alsworth Ross was fired from his position at Stanford University after making remarks contrary to the financial interests of university co-founder Jane Stanford. Mrs. Stanford was heavily invested in the railroad industry, of which Ross was openly critical, saying on one occasion, “A railroad deal is a railroad steal.” He was subsequently dismissed from his faculty post and the incident ignited a fiery debate over academic freedom and university control over ideological expression. Bassett Affair (1903) Not long after Ross left Stanford, John Spencer Bassett was scrutinized at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina—now Duke University. In 1903, he published an article challenging popular views in the South about race relations. He praised notable African-Americans like Booker T. Washington, whom he described as “the greatest man, save General Lee, born in the South in a hundred years.” His publication led to an outraged op-ed in the Raleigh News &amp; Observer and many demanded his termination. Though its vote was not unanimous, the board of trustees decisively rejected Bassett’s resignation, citing academic freedom. The American Association of University Professors In 1915, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) was founded, prompted in large part by extramural utterance cases like those of Ross and Bassett. The AAUP outlined its views on free expression in the 1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure. The document lays out the organization’s beliefs about the role of a faculty&hellip;",

    "content": "Florida has been the punchline to every election-related joke for the last 20 years. Yet Florida has spent the past two decades transforming its election laws into a model for the country. Recent changes are hard to explain, given the success of the 2020 election and the opposition from Florida election administrators. Despite a firestorm of criticism, the new Florida law, SB90, does not make many voter-facing changes. The experience in 2022 will be quite similar the voting in Florida in 2020. SB90 makes some positive changes; it also makes some head scratching ones that will neither improve access nor the security of the ballot. In the end, the new bill seems mostly like a missed opportunity to improve the voting experience for Floridians. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Task Force on Elections recently released updated recommendations for logical election policy with the aim of creating a secure process and multiple avenues for ballot return. Here’s how the new law stacks up against our recommendations.  Changes to Voter Registration Procedures BPC’s task force recommended that states adopt voter registration policies that are more secure and easier. Florida already had some pro-voter provisions that protect security, for example online voter registration participation in an interstate consortium for sharing voter registration information across state lines. However, the state also has the earliest legally allowable registration deadline, almost a month before Election Day, and the state legislatures declined to change this in SB90 despite technological advances and other states’ experience that shows closing registration four weeks before Election Day is not necessary. SB90 allows third-party groups more time to complete tasks and increase the likelihood that voters who register close to the deadline will get registered one way or another. It extends the window when registration applications must be returned from 10 to 14 days and requires the organization to notify the applicant if they will be unable to deliver the application to the supervisor’s office in time and must advise the applicant to either mail in the application or to register online. These changes are improvements. Other requirements in SB90 for voter registration are mixed. The new law requires that the applications completed during third-party drives go to the supervisor of elections in the county in which the voter resides, complicating efforts by groups or universities who are registering many voters from across the state and risking errors that could be avoided by allowing one central return location, as required by the National Voter Registration Act. Fines imposed for mistakes will also be a deterrent for groups making good faith efforts to register voters in a state without automatic voter registration, another BPC recommendation. However, this change will also make it easier for supervisors of elections to process these applications, especially those who were saddled with the high costs of sorting registrations to the appropriate county supervisor. SB90 includes backend changes to voter registration that voters will not see, but that will improve election administration. Following multiple instances of system crashes during the past two cycles, SB90 mandates that the Secretary of State complete a comprehensive risk assessment of the online voter registration system—that includes load testing, malware and vulnerability screening, evaluation to prevent cyber-attacks, and potential risks to voter data—to be done every two years. This is good practice for maintaining the database on which much of the election ecosystem relies. Minimal Changes to Voting Options and Counting the Vote For most Floridians, they will not see a wholly different suite of voting choices in November 2022 than they had in 2020. Voters in Florida will still have access to early voting, mail&hellip;",

    "content": "For the first time in half a century, federal policymakers are seriously considering significant investments in, and structural changes to, our nation’s early care and education system. These long-overdue developments simultaneously impact two generations: they allow parents to work and provide for their family and support children’s educational and lifelong success. They would also be transformative for our country, as our economy and society grow stronger when families have access to affordable, high-quality early care and education programs in their communities. There could be no better investment than in our nation’s early care and education programs, especially as we recover from the pandemic and get our economy back on track. Yet, successful public policy considerations are almost always more complex than they first appear. Recently, historic investments in the child care system from the COVID-19 relief packages have helped set the stage for reframing how we can best support our nation’s working families and child care businesses. Policymakers have an opportunity to build on the lessons learned over the last year and make long-lasting changes to improve our nation’s early care and education system. Doing so will require a holistic approach. Recognizing the fact that children are learning at all times and in all places, below are four recommendations that policymakers should consider when contemplating expanding early care and education programs at the federal level. Several proposals have been introduced in Congress that would change the way the system functions and is financed. President Biden’s American Families Plan proposed expanding our nation’s public K-12 education system by four years, specifically including universal Pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds. Separately, the plan would invest in our nation’s child care system by providing funds to make child care more affordable, support higher quality, and invest in the child care workforce. The role of Head Start and in serving our nation’s most vulnerable children is unclear. Without a more clear delineation, the nation stands a chance of having three separate and competing programs all providing early care and education for three- and four-year olds. While BPC appreciates the concurrent investments to the child care system, it is concerned that creating a new universal Pre-K program outside of the existing early care and education system would have several negative consequences on parents and the child care industry. The child care system is already in a precarious position. The demand for child care greatly outpaces the supply, creating a significant gap in the availability of high-quality and affordable options for parents. Child care often costs more than parents can afford, so to fill capacity, many programs charge tuition based on what parents can pay—not on the true cost of providing high-quality services. And because providing care for infants and toddlers requires more adult staff, it is more expensive to offer and more costly for parents. Businesses help offset the losses from operating infant and toddler classrooms by serving more preschool aged children. This means that many providers have more space for preschool children and less&hellip;",

What this translates to, in agricultural terms, is a 59-98% increase in global food demand over the next three decades. As the timeline to avoid the worst impacts of climate change shortens, global leaders are tasked with advancing agricultural technology that is more innovative, more efficient, and more resilient than ever before. Moreover, these solutions need to be considerate of land scarcity, adaptive to climate change, and mindful of justice and inclusion. Vertical farming is one solution that is changing the way we think about food production. Vertical farming is a type of controlled-environment agriculture (CEA), in which crops are grown indoors in vertically stacked rows that rely on LED lighting technology in the place of natural sunlight. The three types of vertical farming techniques are described below. Source: Modified from https://www.investmentbank.barclays.com/our-insights/vertical-farms-green-agriculture-on-the-rise.html  Vertical farming allows fresh produce to be grown without natural sunlight, soil, or chemical pesticides. Despite requiring fewer inputs than traditional farming, the optimized environments maintained in vertical farms allow crop yields to be maximized year-round, regardless of weather patterns, daylight, or season. New Jersey-based company AeroFarms reports that it produces 390 times more food per square foot than conventional farming, all while using 95% less water. In fact, vertical farms use up to 99% less water than traditional farms, and the small fraction of water that is needed is recycled back into the indoor system for reuse. This stands in stark contrast to traditional agriculture, which currently accounts for 70% of global freshwater withdrawals. The ability of vertical farming to produce more food in up to 99% less space is especially appealing in crowded urban areas, with one company producing 120 pounds of mushrooms per week in a bookcase-sized space. Impressively, vertical farms can be implemented almost anywhere, making local food production a possibility in places where open-field agriculture is not possible. By shortening the food supply chain for open land-constrained areas, vertical farms can offer fresher, safer, and more nutritious produce to neighboring communities in less time. By reducing the amount of food miles it takes for produce to get from farm to table, vertical farming allows nutritional content (which can decrease significantly during transport and storage) to be maintained, while also avoiding transportation-induced carbon emissions. Furthermore, in reducing food miles, food waste is minimized because less food is lost in transport. This is a key benefit to vertical farming, because for traditional field farming, “about one quarter of produced food is lost along the food supply chain.” Vertical farming has attracted attention from the public and private sector alike, as the market for vertical farming is projected to hit $12.77 billion globally by 2026. Multiple American vertical farming companies have received multi-million dollar capital investments from investors like Jeff Bezos, Apple, Google Ventures, IKEA, and the United Arab Emirates, which hopes to use this technology to expand domestic food production. Due to factors like higher energy costs and expensive lighting technology, very large investments are necessary&hellip;",

    "content": "In early March 2021, Tate’s Bake Shop, a well-known national cookie company with a factory based in East Moriches, New York, made headlines following allegations that it threatened to deport immigrant employees who were seeking to unionize. The story began in early 2020 when 500 factory workers, a majority of whom are unauthorized, raised concerns about working conditions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, during the summer of 2020, Tate’s employees reached out to relevant union leaders of Amalgamated Local 298, who subsequently tried to organize the workers. However, before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) mailed union ballots to eligible employees, accusations surfaced that Tate’s had threatened to deport any employee participating in union organizing.1 The allegations against Tate’s, which was sold by the original owner, Kathleen King, to Mondelēz International, Inc. in 2018, reflect a long-standing labor law dilemma that Congress has not yet reconciled with immigration law—namely, how to address unauthorized workers that have been integrated into the American workforce. Unauthorized workers have always been a part of the United States’ workforce, a fact that the pandemic has heightened and emphasized across various essential industries. In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) made it unlawful for an employer to hire, recruit, or refer for work any immigrant knowing that the person is unauthorized to work; to employ any person without verifying his or her work status; or to continue to employ a non-citizen knowing of such person&#8217;s unauthorized work status.2 The act established an employment verification system that requires the employer to attest that the employee&#8217;s work status has been verified by examination of a passport, birth certificate, social security card, immigrant documentation papers, or other proof of work authorization. Tate’s is not the first company to employ unauthorized individuals and subsequently threaten immigration action after they expressed the desire to unionize. In 2002, Hoffman Plastics Compounds Inc. laid off employee José Castro, an unauthorized worker who had engaged in union-organizing. Initially, the plastics company had hired Castro based on documents that appeared to verify his authorization to work. Upon investigating the layoff, the NLRB found that Hoffman violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and ordered backpay to be paid to Castro. Per the NLRA, harassment in response to unionization efforts is illegal, and workers are protected under the act regardless of their immigration status. At a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to determine the amount of backpay owed to Castro, Castro testified that he was indeed born in Mexico, that he had never been legally admitted to, and therefore authorized to work in, the United States, and that he had been hired by Hoffman only after forging a birth certificate belonging to a friend born in Texas. Based on Castro’s testimony, the ALJ found that the NLRB was precluded from awarding Castro backpay on the basis of a pre-IRCA Supreme Court decision, Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, (467 U.S. 883), and by IRCA itself, since he was unauthorized. The&hellip;",

    "content": "Mapping tools, such as the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) National Broadband Map are used to illustrate where broadband internet services are available and help determine economic opportunity gaps propelled by access to 21st century infrastructure. To connect Americans, it is essential to know where to invest in broadband infrastructure. To improve access, it must first be measured. The accuracy of these maps is vital to informing how broadband investments are deployed and funded. Multiple government agencies use data from the FCC maps to inform spending, including $20 billion used by the FCC’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to bring broadband to rural homes, more than $13 billion invested in rural broadband through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Reconnect Program, $9 billion per year administered through the Universal Service Administrative Company’s (USAC) Universal Service Fund, and $4.3 billion of broadband infrastructure projects overseen by NTIA. However, shortcomings of the FCC’s dataset have been identified and criticized. Most notably, the Form 477 that service providers use to file data to the FCC counts an entire census block as ‘served’ if just one household on the block has good broadband access. This misleading information only makes it more difficult to close the digital divide in rural areas with large census blocks that have widely discrepant access to broadband. Moreover, a residential block is considered to have broadband ‘available’ if the service will be provided within a 10-day period. *Data from FCC 2019 Broadband Report based on Form 477 data and Microsoft   Coverage maps do not tell the entire story. Only 5.6% of the U.S. population lacks “access” to broadband coverage at the standard 25/3 Mbps speed, still 34.9% of the population does not subscribe to broadband services. When isolating the disparity between “availability” and “adoption” in urban areas, most people are not able, or are choosing not to take advantage of the benefits of high-speed internet access. The cost of internet service – from equipment to installation costs on top of monthly fees – is one of the main barriers preventing people from getting online. Politicians have discussed ways to lower costs and boost adoption in rural and urban areas where internet is accessible. The American Jobs Plan proposes one method, known as price transparency, to encourage service providers to disclose their prices to the public and boost competition. FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has created a plan to progress the database of broadband availability and no longer rely on deceptive and restricted information. She is committed to upholding the Broadband DATA Act that requires the FCC, beginning in March 2020., to change its broadband data collection methods. Further, additional funding was provided in the December 2020 stimulus package. In a recent development, the FCC has dedicated resources to crowdsourcing information for its mapping tools including through its FCC Speed Test. The Speed Test will help inform consumers, policymakers, and other stakeholders about broadband services across the U.S. However, not everyone can participate in a&hellip;",

    "content": "As the United States continues to ramp up its vaccination campaign and the job market picks up strength, the country is rounding the corner of one of the largest economic downturns since the Great Depression. It is typical during economic downturns that support for increasing immigration loses steam. However, if the United States hopes to make a complete recovery, Congress needs to reconcile with the idea that increasing immigration may be instrumental in ensuring continued, long-term economic growth, as well as key in maintaining the country’s global competitive advantage. In 2017, the Bipartisan Policy Center published a report on America’s demographic challenge, arguing that immigration has and can mitigate some of the negative fiscal and economic effects of slowing population growth and an aging population in the United States. Now, almost four years later, many of the challenges outlined in the original report have been exacerbated by the pandemic, further supporting the notion that increasing immigration can help in solve the demographic problem. In early 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that 2030 will be a turning point for the demographic makeup of the United States. As shown in Figure 1, all baby boomers will be older than 65 by 2030, which will expand the size of the elderly population so that 1 in every 5 residents will be of retirement age. By 2060, the Census Bureau projects that nearly 1 in 4 Americans will be an older adult. Although the Bureau projected births to be nearly four times larger than the level of net international migration1 in coming decades, a rising number of deaths and declining fertility rates will increasingly offset how much births can contribute to overall population growth. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this trend. While the official 2020 Census demographic data will not be published until this summer, initial results released in April 2021 show that the U.S. population has grown at the slowest rate since the 1930s. The birthrate also declined for the sixth straight year in 2020, and has fallen by approximately 19% since its peak in 2007.2 Experts anticipate that when the final data is published, it will likely detail an unprecedented stagnation in population growth, a continued decrease in Americans’ geographical mobility, more pronounced population aging, a first-time decline in the size of the white population, and rising racial and ethnic diversity among millennials, Generation Z, and younger groups. Because of the pandemic, 2020 also witnessed the largest annual decline in the number of immigrants entering the United States. In 2019, the Census Bureau projected that net international migration was set to fall to its lowest levels this decade, and recent federal data supports this conclusion. According to the Cato Institute, the total number of immigrants legally entering the U.S. declined by 87% this past year, as the State Department closed its consulates and President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending new visa issuances to most immigrant categories. BPC’s research suggests that even before Trump’s proclamation, the United States was experiencing&hellip;",

    "content": "A new Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult poll shows the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a massive impact on the workforce as millions of workers have reduced the hours they work or stopped working altogether due to caregiving responsibilities. Parents with young children, as well as Black and Hispanic caregivers, have been impacted the hardest. Caregivers who have access to paid family leave (PFL) benefits have been better able to manage work and caregiving, while those who are not working or working fewer hours said paid family leave would make them more likely to return to work or to work more. The poll found that of people who stopped working during the pandemic, 15% &#8211; or 10.6 million workers – said that caregiving responsibilities was a cause. Among those who reduced their hours, 16% &#8211; 11.7 million workers – cited caregiving as a reason. With workers who stopped working and did not look for new work, 8% to 11% cited caregiving as a cause. This suggests that 3.4 to 4.6 million workers dropped out of the labor force during COVID-19 at least in part due to caregiving. 71% of parents with children under the age of two said that caregiving affected their ability to work during the pandemic. Of all adults who stopped working, 8% cited caregiving needs resulting from school or child care program closures—totaling over 5 million adults. Black adults were three times as likely as white adults (22% to 7%) to cite caregiving for relatives as a reason they stopped working. Among caregivers, Black and Hispanic workers were much more likely to cite this responsibility as significantly impacting their ability to work than white workers (39% and 35% compared to 24%). This poll found that only 28% of currently employed workers had the option to take paid family leave over the past year, despite emergency government measures and benefits offered voluntarily by employers. Moreover, currently employed men were twice as likely as women (36% to 18%) to have the option—28 million men to 13 million women. While this poll finds a troubling and chronic dilemma for people – especially parents – struggling to balance work and caregiving, it also offers a glimmer of hope. Among adults with access to paid family leave, 71% said the benefit helped them continue to work. 86% of parents with children under the age of 12 said it helped them keep working. Among Hispanic and Black adults with a PFL option, 78% and 73%, respectively, said it helped. Among all adults who had PFL benefits, more than half (51%) used the benefit during the pandemic. Among those who did not have PFL benefits, over one-third (34%) said it would have helped them to continue to work. 38% of all unemployed workers said PFL would help them return to work sooner. That percentage jumps to 47% for unemployed parents, to 50% of unemployed Black workers, and to 59% of unemployed workers currently seeking work.

    "content": "View the infographic School and child care program closures, as well as widespread illness, have resulted in historic caregiving responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. To better understand the labor market implications of these challenges, the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult conducted a poll on the impact that caregiving has had on workers since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role that paid family leave has and can play in helping adults balance caregiving and work. The poll finds that since the onset of COVID-19, many workers have had no choice but to cut back their work hours or leave their job all together. Meanwhile, paid family leave has helped the vast majority of those with access to the benefit continue to work and would have helped a substantial portion of those who did not have a paid leave benefit. Many individuals also felt that paid family leave would help them return to work or increase their work hours. Of those who stopped working during the pandemic, 15%&#8211;roughly 10.6 million workers—cited caregiving as a reason. Two-thirds (66%) of Black and Hispanic caregivers say that their caregiving responsibilities impacted their ability to work during the pandemic. 71% of workers with the option to take paid family leave say that it helped them continue to work, including 86% of parents with children under 12. 38% of unemployed workers today say they would be more likely to return to work sooner if they had access to paid family leave, including 47% of unemployed parents. 53% of workers who reduced their work hours during the pandemic say that they would be more likely to increase their hours if they had access to paid family leave. Morning Consult polled a national sample of 2,200 adults. The poll was conducted between April 6-April 14, 2021. Caregiving played a substantial role in disrupting work during the pandemic. Caregiving was a factor for over 10 million adults who stopped working during COVID-19, and over 3 million who left the labor force. Of those who stopped working, 15% cited caregiving as a reason. That translates to roughly 10.6 million adults stopping work, at least in part, due to caregiving.1 Among those who stopped working during the COVID-19 pandemic: 8% cited caregiving demands resulting from school or child care center closures. 9% cited caregiving responsibilities for other family members or relatives. Black adults (22%) were three times as likely as white adults (7%) to cite caregiving for other family members or relatives. Men were more likely than women to cite caregiving as a reason they stopped working. Of those who stopped working, 10% of women and 19% of men cited caregiving.2 Among those who stopped working and didn’t look for work, 8% to 11% cited caregiving.

    "content": "What do new data on business creation mean for economic recovery—and for policymakers seeking to support that recovery? On one hand, entrepreneurship appears to be surging. On the other hand, part of that surge might be entrepreneurial activity that doesn’t necessarily lead to job creation. Here, we look at three different datasets and what they might be telling us about entrepreneurship, jobs, and the economy. During the first quarter of 2021, on average, 450,000 new business applications were filed with the government. That was nearly double the pre-COVID monthly average. Since July 2020, the monthly average for new business applications has been 90 percent higher than the pre-pandemic average from 2004 to February 2020. This is according to data collected by the Census Bureau in its Business Formation Statistics. What is a “new business application”? It’s a filing with the Internal Revenue Service for an employer identification number, EIN. As the nearby chart shows, monthly business applications generally trended upward from 2014 to the beginning of 2020. They shrank sharply in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April 2020. Record-setting months followed. Not all business applications are classified the same way, however. Some are deemed to be “high-propensity,” meaning the Census Bureau deems them to have a high propensity of becoming an employer business. That is, one with employees. Thus, some applications are from “likely employers” and some are from “likely nonemployers.” This determination is based on a set of factors. As shown in the chart, the monthly number of high-propensity business applications never recovered from the Great Recession. The monthly average, from mid-2009 to February 2020, remained about 23 percent below the 2004-07 average. Since then, from July 2020 to March 2021, the monthly average of high-propensity applications has been 32 percent higher than the pre-pandemic average. Business applications, from both likely employers and likely nonemployers, has surged since the summer of 2020. Analysis by John Haltiwanger has shown that this surge has been particularly strong for restaurants and retail stores, especially e-commerce. Given the nature of the crisis of the past year, that’s not too surprising. The overall increase in business creation in 2020 is also reflected in another set of data from the Census Bureau, the Current Population Survey. This is one input into the Kauffman Foundation’s annual report on early-stage entrepreneurship. The report for 2020 shows a record high “rate of new entrepreneurs,” at 0.38 percent. This indicates that, in any given month, 380 out of every 100,000 Americans were involved in starting a new business—that they were not doing three months earlier. As the chart indicates, this was a sharp increase over 2019—after two years of decline—and the highest level in 25 years of data. Encouragingly, the rate of new entrepreneurs increased for every demographic group: men and women, immigrants and the native-born, every age group, every educational level, and every race and ethnicity. The Kauffman Indicators and CPS data also track what’s called the “opportunity share” of new entrepreneurs—the percentage&hellip;",

There are a variety of ways in which broadband, or high-speed internet, can be delivered, which complicates policy efforts that do not lend themselves to a one-size-fits-all approach.The pandemic has thrust broadband access and the digital divide to the forefront of American life. Millions of students have been attending school virtually, with many struggling to obtain or maintain sufficient internet speed. Restrictions on in-person shopping and community lockdowns moved many services online, putting Americans who cannot afford or access broadband internet at a disadvantage. Those American workers fortunate enough to work from home have faced challenges with access to limited internet bandwidth. This new normal has elevated access to high-speed internet/broadband from a luxury to a necessity. These conditions have made the need for addressing the pre-existing “digital divide” a hot topic amongst policymakers. Depending on the source, there could be anywhere from 19 (the FCC’s estimate) to 162 million people (Microsoft’s estimate) without access to high-speed internet at home. Congress took steps in passing Covid relief packages to address the gap in broadband access by providing $7.1 billion in funding for broadband connectivity and infrastructure for schools and libraries. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan appropriates $220 billion to states. These funds are for broadband infrastructure investment and support to individual households to bring down the cost of broadband. Many believe the budget is insufficient to fully address the digital divide, and Congress is expected to provide additional assistance through future infrastructure bills. The FCC has made closing the digital divide a priority with considerable excitement about the deployment of 5G. The fifth-generation standard is breaking new ground in wireless technology and improving internet access, but how and if it can be used to close the digital divide remains unclear. As they wrestle with issues related to broadband access, policymakers must have a basic understanding of what broadband is, what 5G means (and how it differs from 2G, 3G, and so on), and how it all fits into the landscape of closing the digital divide. What Does “G” Mean? G refers to generation. Several years ago, your cell phone started displaying 4G instead of 3G. We are entering the fifth generation (5G) of specifications that define mobile technology standards. Standards, set by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), include minimum and maximum speeds, hardware and software, IT protocols, frequencies, and spectrum. . The lifespan of these generations has typically been about a decade. The first generation was built on analog technology, which enabled cellular voice calls to be made. Then, 2G leaped to using digital infrastructure, which enabled the transmission of multimedia files, SMS texts, and digitally encrypted phone calls over the network. 3G was a Big Leap Forward When 3G networks first came online in 2002, it was like trading a Ford Taurus in for a Formula One car. The average speed of 3G connections is 3 megabits per second (Mbps), which was 30 times faster&hellip;",

    "content": "Women in the United States comprise roughly half of the workforce, and it has been estimated that 72% of female workers will become pregnant during the course of their career. And yet, pregnant workers in this country still do not have the full legal protection of the law. Many expectant women continue to be discharged from their jobs or denied reasonable accommodations that would enable them to fulfill their duties safely, leaving them and their families economically and physically vulnerable. Over the last 10 years, there have been almost 40,000 pregnancy discrimination complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and recurrent litigation, emphasizing the inadequacy of current statutory protections. The passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 served to amend Title VII of the landmark Civil Rights Act (1964) to specifically target and “prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy” and function as a critical protection for women in the workforce. The law specifically bans “discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,” terms broad enough to protect the full spectrum of pregnancy disability. In addition, the statute also requires employers to treat pregnant women on an “equal” basis with other temporarily disabled employees, including in the establishment of accommodation or benefits. Unfortunately, the law contains significant carve-outs that leave far too many women unprotected. Businesses with fewer than 15 employees are exempt from the provisions of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, despite the fact that almost 20 million Americans work in our nation’s smallest businesses. In addition, the law’s equality standard does not confer additional legal protections or accommodations for pregnant women, which leaves them open to termination or forced unpaid leave. In 1990, enactment of The American Disabilities Act created a new standard wherein employers are required to provide a “reasonable accommodation” for disabled persons to allow for the equal access and participation in the job, unless it would cause the business “undue hardship.” While pregnancy itself is not considered a disability under the ADA, many related conditions and impairments, such as gestational diabetes and hypertension, are protected inclusions. The Pregnant Worker’s Fairness Act, a bicameral bill, was introduced in the Senate yesterday by a group of bipartisan lawmakers led by Sens. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA). Its House counterpart is led by Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and John Katko (R-NY). This legislation will help to “eliminate discrimination and promote women’s health and economic security by ensuring reasonable workplace accommodations for workers whose ability to perform the functions of a job are limited by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.” The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, if enacted, would foster non-discrimination practices by making it unlawful for businesses to: Deny reasonable accommodations to employees subject to limitations resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions. Companies with less than 15 employees or those that can demonstrate “undue hardship” resulting from such regulation would be exempt. Deny a covered employee the right to an interactive process with the employer regarding the specific limitations and reasonable accommodations needed, or accept unsolicited accommodations.&hellip;",

    "content": "Democracy policy issues continue to dominate the national discourse in the wake of the 2020 general election. While topics like absentee voting and campaign finance reform are drawing the most attention, prison-based gerrymandering—a consequential redistricting issue that raises pressing questions about representation—has gone largely undiscussed. Because of the pandemic, states are still waiting for 2020 census data to draw their local, state-level, and congressional districts for the next decade. This delay offers states a unique and urgent opportunity to end prison gerrymandering and undo its anti-democratic impact on our electoral system. Since 1790, the census has determined population distribution by counting people at their ‘usual residence,’ or the place where they live and sleep most of the time. This means that incarcerated individuals are counted as residents of their correctional facilities—not the places where they lived prior to imprisonment. In most states, this census data is then used to apportion political jurisdictions for the next decade, despite the average length of a prison sentence being less than three years. Population change between census cycles is inevitable, and largely out of government control. However, prison populations are predictably transient, so counting them in accordance with the ‘usual residence’ policy cements unnecessary inconsistencies into political maps each decade. Nevertheless, through the early 1970s, the small scale of the national incarcerated population meant that counting prisoners this way had little impact on representation. This is no longer the case. The national prison population has increased by 500% since 1974, and today more than 1.4 million people are incarcerated in state and federal prisons. Because of the ways in which mass incarceration policies intersect with and exacerbate broader social and economic disparities, communities of color—particularly Black Americans—are overrepresented in today’s carceral system. Despite comprising 13.4% of the U.S. population, Black Americans account for 32.9% of the state and federal prison population. While Black and Latin0 communities make up an unequal share of the prison population, prisons themselves are disproportionately located in rural, white communities. Rural and nonmetro constituencies—which are 80% white and make up just 20% of the US population—house more than 40% of all state and federal prisons and 60% of recent prison construction. The representational disparity this creates is stark: following the 2011 redistricting cycle, more than 160 prison districts across 31 states had incarcerated Black populations that outnumbered their non-incarcerated Black constituencies. Furthermore, in all but two states, prisoners lose the right to vote for at least the duration of their prison sentence. When disenfranchised prison populations are counted as residents of generally unrepresentative constituencies, they artificially inflate the institutional representation of prison districts at the expense of their home communities. This phenomenon is referred to as ‘prison gerrymandering.’ The transfer of populations (and, subsequently, representational clout) from prisoners’ home communities to prison districts is significantly impactful. A recent case study of Pennsylvania determined that, if all prisoners in the state were counted in their home districts, four majority-white, non-metro state assembly districts would no longer meet the minimum population threshold&hellip;",

    "content": "“XR” is a general term for immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Contrary to popular belief, these technologies can be used for much more than just gaming and entertainment purposes. People and businesses are already using XR for various other purposes, such as improving retail experiences, testing furniture virtually in a home, and designing digital prototypes for cars. The growth of the XR market over the past decade, and its potential going forward, gives policymakers reason to notice and think through its policy implications. XR can currently be segmented into three main categories: AR, VR, and mixed reality (MR). AR superimposes digital information like an image or text onto real objects or environments. Current examples include the yellow yard marker on football broadcasts or face-altering filters on social media platforms. VR is an interactive experience that allows users to leave physical reality and wholly immerse themselves in a virtual space. For instance, NASA uses a VR training facility to train its astronauts for rescue scenarios on spacewalks or to handle objects in space through immersive simulations. MR combines these two experiences so that virtual and physical objects can interact directly, such as a doctor who gets to practice complicated surgeries in an operating room through a projected simulation. These technologies are not always distinct from each other and fall on a spectrum from most virtual to least. XR is a fast-growing market, with large tech companies putting significant resources into developing XR products. Kenneth Research estimates XR production will grow by 46.5% annually from 2020 to 2026 and calculates global demand for XR to reach $346 billion by 2026. Statista estimates that around 77 million XR headsets will be shipped to customers by 2024. According to Grand View Research, the VR market (a subset of the XR market) has grown from around $205 million in 2016, to almost $22 billion in 2021, and is forecasted to increase at an annual rate of 18% from 2021 to 2028. While these forecasts may prove overly optimistic, the market is already large enough for policymakers to start learning about the technology and the policy implications. Today, XR technologies are becoming increasingly mainstream. XR tools have become more commonplace in a range of industries and government, from retailers letting customers try on eyeglasses with AR to the military training soldiers with MR, to schools using VR for educational experiences (such as virtual field trips). Advancements in XR hardware and software will continue to make these technologies more accessible while people discover additional innovative use cases. XR technology brings potential benefits and challenges that policymakers may need to address. Benefits include finding new ways to educate students, design products, and convey information. Workforce training and R&amp;D policy can help guide the development and application of these technologies to raise living standards and boost economic competitiveness. Challenges include finding ways to protect privacy and secure data, fostering inclusion and access, and addressing other critical issues, such as safety and bias. In&hellip;",

In fact, 2020 marked the sixth consecutive year in which ten or more billion-dollar natural disasters impacted the United States, including devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that sea levels and precipitation will continue to increase, and extreme weather events continue to grow more frequent and severe over the decades ahead. In light of these projections, America urgently needs to make investments to make communities more resilient, especially to protect against flood-related disasters—the costliest and most frequent disaster threat in the nation.

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center , together with S&#038;P Global, recently launched an ESG Task Force to serve as a resource for federal policymakers who have begun wrestling with questions around corporate governance and how companies factor environmental and social considerations into their business and financial operations. In the coming months, BPC and the task force will be examining many dimensions of this. Here, we look at some basic questions about ESG that have not yet been adequately answered. How is ESG defined? Once defined, how is ESG information disclosed? And once disclosed, how is ESG information used? Environmental, Social, and Governance—aka, “ESG”—has quite possibly been the fastest growing economic concept our country has seen in decades. ESG issues have taken corporate governance by storm. What started out as factors to assess companies’ sustainable and societal impact has grown into a broader set of factors used to evaluate a company’s long-term economic success. Traditionally, the concept&#8217;s three letters, E, S, and G, subdivide various issues depending on perspective. The &#8220;E&#8221; generally focuses on environmental issues such as climate change, sustainability, and pollution. The &#8220;S&#8221; generally focuses on social issues such as workforce development, diversity, and community impact. The &#8220;G&#8221; generally focuses on governance issues such as executive compensation, board diversity, and corporate culture. Traditionally, while many of these issues were seen to relate in some way to corporate performance, they were not incorporated into a company’s financial metrics. This is because they did not meet the test for what information is considered financially material and relevant to a reasonable investor. That is the current standard for materiality, with boards of companies given the discretion—based on their intimate knowledge of a company—to determine what information is or is not material. The materiality standard was set by the U.S. Supreme Court to help determine the balance between how much information is enough for investors and how much is overwhelming. Companies are not required to disclose information merely because investors or the general public want it. Rather, they must disclose those things that are financially material to the well-being of the company. ESG shifts the debate over materiality. Previously, as noted, the question was about how much material economic information should be disclosed. Now, new questions have been raised about inclusion of traditionally non-economic factors in the materiality analysis. In many cases, too, those non-economic factors are judged by qualitative measures, adding another layer of debate. With ESG gaining more attention and prominence, disclosure becomes central to evaluating companies—and central to the issues that policymakers will find themselves addressing. This is to say nothing about the added complexity when considering various global regulating agencies and associated geopolitical issues involved in assessing ESG. Once a piece of information is considered material and therefore should be disclosed, the next step is determining how it will be disclosed. Unlike traditional quantitative economic data, the qualitative nature of ESG data becomes more difficult to disclose in a comparable format. As a result, several organizations have developed disclosure frameworks to&hellip;",

    "content": "Numerous measures to address migration at the U.S.-Mexico border were implemented during President Donald Trump’s term, many of which were highly controversial. Over the past four years, policies at the southwest border have included the construction of a border wall and the apprehension and expulsion of many asylum-seeking migrants. The situation at the border became one of the Trump administration’s primary concerns, and the response was characterized by increasing restrictions and decreasing access to the United States. Having promised to roll back many of President Trump’s immigration policies on the campaign trail, President Joe Biden’s plan to gradually undo the Trump administration&#8217;s border policies have been complicated by recent increases in the arrivals of families and children at the border. The administration is facing increasing pressure from some Democrats and immigration advocates to move quickly while Republicans have blamed the recent increases in arrivals on that very same campaign rhetoric. Regardless of the press sound bites, Biden has left many of Trump’s border policies in place, at least for now. Trump’s Legacy President Trump campaigned on the promise to construct a massive border wall, a project that has failed to meet expectations, with only 47 of the promised 800 miles built during his four years in office. Research on the effectiveness of border walls in deterring migrants has been largely inconclusive, yet as of October 2020, the Department of Homeland Security maintained that a physical barricade at the border works. According to the department, infrastructure added to the border wall during the Trump administration included internally hardened steel-bollard barriers, new and improved all-weather access roads, perimeter lighting, enforcement cameras, and other related technology to effectively control crime at the border and aid U.S. Border Patrol officers in its maintenance. Additionally, President Trump’s February 2019 declaration of a national emergency concerning the southern border cites “a humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests” and increasingly worsening unlawful migration. This declaration permitted the use of the armed forces at the border and the diversion of billions of dollars from other federal programs to construct the wall. Biden’s Actions On his first day in office, President Biden signed a proclamation terminating President Trump’s 2019 emergency declaration, arguing that the construction of a border wall was “not a serious policy solution” and a misuse of U.S. taxpayer dollars. In his action, President Biden paused both the construction and funding of the border wall as well as the repurposing of contracts with private contractors. However, as of March 2021, the president’s decision to freeze funds is currently under investigation, as the Government Accountability Office reviews whether or not President Biden violated congressional budget rules. Recent press reports of remarks by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas indicate that some unfinished portions of the wall may yet be constructed, but the administration’s recently-released discretionary budget proposes to rescind (send back to Congress) unused funding previously appropriated for the wall. The future of the border wall is therefore unclear. Trump’s Legacy The Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), also referred&hellip;",

    "content": "The higher education system suffers from a lack of affordability that can limit access for low-income students, a challenge BPC’s Task Force on Higher Education Financing and Student Outcomes addressed in its final report last year. The latest proposal to make college more affordable for low-income students comes from Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) with the Earn to Learn Act. The newly introduced bipartisan bill would incentivize saving for college though a savings match program, while helping students develop healthy financial practices. Even prior to the pandemic, 44% of low-income households reported being unable to pay all of their bills in a typical month. Within that financial reality, saving for college is an immense challenge—one that has been compounded by rising prices at higher education institutions and the declining purchasing power of Pell Grants. These trends have pushed a college degree even further out of reach for low-income families. The Earn to Learn Act seeks to address this problem by implementing a college savings vehicle through which low-income families could contribute to a college savings fund and receive a generous 8:1 matching grant. These grants would supplement other sources of federal aid, including Pell Grants, and reduce debt burdens among low-income students without affecting aid eligibility. The Earn to Learn Act is modeled on an Arizona program of the same name that serves Pell-eligible students. Early evidence of program impact is promising: over half of participants are graduating without student debt. Those who do carry debt graduate with a lower burden than similar borrowers at the same schools—less than $10,000, compared to approximately $23,000 for their peers. While these are encouraging outcomes, additional research to determine whether a more moderate match ratio would produce similar results may be useful. A lower matching incentive would allow the program to serve a greater number of students. Every dollar that eligible families save for college in excess of $500 would be matched by $8 in grant funding. Match funds would be paid directly to the institution of higher learning upon enrollment. The program would be implemented by a state agency or non-profit that would retain a high degree of flexibility with regard to program design, such as the selection of eligible educational institutions and the determination of what income levels would qualify. The bill allocates $100 million in federal funding to the program each year through a competitive grant, with administering agencies required to demonstrate both a commitment of non-federal funds as a 1:1 match as well as capacity to launch and implement the program. In order to receive the match, students must: Be from a low-income family Contribute at least $500 to an educational savings account Successfully complete a personal finance training program Submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Be admitted to an institution of higher learning Fulfill any other requirements set by the state or administering organization States or administering organizations would also be responsible for verifying enrollment and tracking student outcomes through data sharing&hellip;",

    "content": "The economic fallout from COVID-19 continues to exact a toll on America’s patchwork unemployment insurance (UI) system. State trust funds, which normally finance benefits, have been strained by an unprecedented swell of claims. According to new data from the Department of Labor, the trust funds of 40 U.S. states and territories have resources below the minimum solvency standards recommended by the federal government. Meanwhile, unemployed workers continue to face difficulties accessing benefits, a result of administrative problems stemming from heightened demand and historic underfunding. In order to shore up trust fund resources, states are borrowing from the federal government. As of January 1, 2021, 18 states have a total of $45.5 billion in outstanding loans. When these loans come due, it could dampen the economic recovery by imposing additional federal tax increases on employers. (It is worth noting that many of these employers will already face higher state taxes this year, a result of “experience rating,” which ties a business’s UI payroll tax rate to the number of workers accessing benefits.) Policymakers could address this challenge by linking trust fund relief to administrative improvements, which would help avoid tax hikes while simultaneously enhancing benefit delivery. As we detailed in a previous blog, the UI system is a federal-state partnership. Under normal circumstances, states are primarily responsible for the cost of benefits, which are financed by state payroll taxes on employers. (The federal government has taken on the cost of the expansions and benefit supplements enacted in response to COVID-19.) These state resources are held by the U.S. Treasury Department in individual trust funds for each state. The federal government also applies a UI payroll tax on employers, which is used to fund the administrative costs for UI. States can borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department to finance benefits if their trust funds come under pressure. States that are unable to repay their debt in full within roughly a two-year time period enter what is known as a “credit reduction state.” When this occurs, employers in the state lose eligibility for a tax credit on their federal UI payroll tax, causing their effective tax rate to sharply increase from 0.6% to 6% on the first $7,000 of wages. The additional revenues are then used to pay down the debt states owe to the federal government. This system provides an important cushion for states, allowing a self-financed way for unemployed workers to continue accessing benefits regardless of the solvency of a state’s trust fund. Unfortunately, however, given the potential long-term economic ramifications of COVID-19, employers could very well face these tax increases before the economy reaches full employment. New research suggests that this could lead to reductions in hiring, potentially hampering the economic recovery. Meanwhile, unemployed workers continue to face delays in accessing UI benefits due to antiquated infrastructure and increased claims. In February, just six states reported meeting the federal standard of providing benefits to 87% of applicants within three weeks. Additionally, the system suffers from significant fraud.

    "content": "New U.S. Customs and Border Protection data released in early April reveals an historic increase in the number of unaccompanied children being encountered at the border, as well as overall encounters, with the number of encounters this fiscal year already surpassing the total number of encounters seen in FY2020. The new figures come as the Biden administration has struggled with the logistical challenges of processing arriving migrants, particularly housing the record-setting number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. Should these trends continue, the Biden administration will likely face continuing challenges in adapting border infrastructure—originally designed to process single adult individuals—to process more children and families. As Figure 1 shows, the total number of CBP encounters1 at the southwest border continued to outpace prior trends seen in the last several years. In March 2021, CBP encountered a total of 168,195 arrivals. This brings the year-to-date total for encounters in FY2021 to 550,406, well surpassing the total number of encounters seen over the course of FY2020.2 Source: CBP (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) The March CBP data reveals the extent to which the number of unaccompanied children (UACs) and families arriving at the southwest border has increased exponentially. As shown in Figure 2, the number of children apprehended by Border Patrol reached 18,663 in March alone, the largest monthly total since the Border Patrol began keeping track. This figure is well above the previous monthly highs when CBP apprehended 10,620 children in June 2014 and 11,475 children in May 2019. Source: CBP (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)  The rise in UACs arriving at the border are primarily non-Mexican minors (i.e., children from the Northern Triangle countries). As shown in Figure 3, in FY2021 year-to-date, only 11,785 of the 47,642 unaccompanied minors encountered at the border have been Mexican nationals, compared to the 34,076 children from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Encounters of UACs have fluctuated significantly in the last decade. In FY2011, for example, Mexican children accounted for 73% of UAC apprehensions, while those from the Northern Triangle countries accounted for only 27%. By FY2019, the proportions had reversed, with Mexican nationals comprising 14% of all UAC apprehensions at the southwest border while 86% were from the Northern Triangle countries. The FYTD2021 data reflects this continuing trend with approximately 72% of children encountered being from North Triangle countries, while only 25% encountered are from Mexico. Source: CBP (1)(2) This significant rise in UACs arriving at the border is a result of many factors, including two deadly hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic, that have exacerbated poverty levels in the Northern Triangle region. In addition, the rise has coincided with the Biden administration’s decision to exempt UACs from the Title 42 program, which immediately expels most arriving migrants from the United States, pursuant to public health grounds. Instead, UACs apprehended by a Border Patrol agent are now brought to a local Border Patrol station and processed for transfer to the Department of Health and Human Services, pursuant to immigration law.

While media coverage of this sweeping legislation has focused on vital components like stimulus checks, extended unemployment insurance, small business support, and vaccination assistance, less attention has been given to the $10.4 billion allotted to support U.S. agriculture and rural communities. As described by a recent Farm Bureau analysis, this amount enables the purchase and distribution of agricultural products, advances COVID-19 mitigation efforts for agricultural workers, bolsters health care in rural communities, and provides debt forgiveness for farmers of color. The ARP provides $4 billion in USDA provisions to restore gaps in the food supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure long-term food supply resilience. Funding is allocated for food distribution by food banks, restaurants, and nonprofits to feed families and to provide reliable demand for farmer products. This includes support for food processors and distributors, farmers markets, food banks, local food systems and producers in the form of grants, and loans to respond to COVID-19 and protect workers. Additional provisions in the ARP account for the unique challenges the COVID-19 crisis has imposed on rural America. The Act establishes $500 million in funding to help increase access to COVID-19 vaccines and food assistance provided by local communities, and rural hospitals. Beyond programs administered by the USDA, the ARP makes investments in rural communities by providing financial assistance for housing costs and expanding internet connectivity. The ARP includes provisions for $10.4 billion in funding to support U.S. farmers in the form of training, technical assistance, and most significantly debt relief. Nearly half of this funding will specifically target the historically “socially disadvantaged,” which the legislation designates as a class of producers that includes African Americans, American Indians or Alaskan natives, Hispanics, and Asians or Pacific Islanders. The ARP will effectively cancel $4 billion worth of debt incurred by farmers of color, forgiving 120% of the value of loans from the Farm Service Agency, FSA guaranteed loans, and CCC Farm Storage Facility loans. Approximately $1.01 billion will go toward providing technical assistance, and financial support for these producers. Notably, the ARP sets floors for spending and allows for discretion regarding where additional funding is spent: Amount (floor) Program or Priority Area $50,500,000 To provide financial assistance to socially disadvantaged farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners that are former farm loan borrowers that suffered related adverse actions or past discrimination or bias in USDA programs. $50,500,000 To provide outreach, mediation, financial training, capacity building training, cooperative development training and support, and other technical assistance on issues concerning food, agriculture, agricultural credit, agricultural extension, rural development, or nutrition to socially disadvantaged farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners, or other members of socially disadvantaged groups. $50,500,000 To provide grants and loans to improve land access for socially disadvantaged farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners, including issues related to heirs’ property. $50,500,000 To support and supplement agricultural research, education, and&hellip;",

Another Win for Christian Student Group at University of Iowa Elizabeth Redden | Inside Higher Ed | March 23, 2021 In a legal victory for University of Iowa student association Business Leaders in Christ, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit found that school administrators can be held personally liable for discriminating against the group when it revoked their status as an official campus organization. The ruling stems from a 2017 lawsuit in which Business Leaders in Christ sued the university, and won (twice) in district court, after school officials derecognized the religious group because their rules denied leadership roles to sexually active gay students. Meriwether v. Hartop et al. United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit | March 26, 2021 The Sixth Circuit has ruled that Professor Nicholas Meriwether can proceed with a First Amendment lawsuit against his employer, Shawnee State University. The court found that “Meriwether has plausibly alleged that Shawnee State burdened his free-exercise rights” after the school disciplined him for creating a “hostile environment” when he refused to call a transgender student by preferred pronouns. Meriwether instead referred to the transgender student by surname and to the other students using “Mr.” or “Ms.” Protesters Rally in Support of Former Coach Shay, ETSU Basketball Players Slater Teague, Kaylyn Kluck, Anslee Daniel | WJHL 11 News | April 6, 2021 At East Tennessee State University, students and community members gathered to support Jason Shay, who resigned as head coach of the ETSU men’s basketball team amid backlash after the team kneeled during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice.

    "content": "The ongoing debate over the role and purpose of corporations is complex, vibrant, and long-running. There are also many unanswered, and even unaddressed, questions about the boundaries of company responsibility, the nature of corporate-government interaction, and more. Those are the topline takeaways from a three-part series of discussions that the Bipartisan Policy Center hosted with JUST Capital and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce from July 2020 to February of this year. Topics ranged from how corporations were responding to the COVID-19 crisis to the evolving nature of capitalism, and everything in between. Tom Quaadman, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, and Martin Whittaker, CEO of JUST Capital, were incredibly generous with their time and thoughtfulness on these issues. Below, we have summarized the main themes from those discussions. Some of them foreshadow what will be examined by a new task force BPC launched on ESG: environmental, social, and governance factors. Others relate to big-picture issues of corporate purpose. All of them are relevant to the emerging debate in Washington over what the public and its elected representatives expect from companies. The nature and purpose of the corporation have evolved over hundreds of years. Debate over its proper role and orientation toward society has been present since the beginning. The U.S. Chamber, Quaadman pointed out, has been exploring ESG and the question of stakeholder interests for several years with partners across the country. But the long-running discussion over corporate purpose and responsibility has been given renewed energy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies found themselves in the position of not only reacting directly to the virus and its effects, but also helping their employees, customers, and communities respond. The crisis has raised new questions, too, about how companies interact with the government. Such debate—and inevitable disagreement—is a good thing, according to Quaadman and Whittaker. For one thing, it is so far being driven by the market, by companies themselves. For another, it reflects a healthy dynamism of capitalism and shifts in the nature of competition. To a casual observer, the debate about corporations is simple: do they have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value or to serve the interests of a broader set of stakeholders? Quaadman put this question in terms of two different types of education he received. In school, he said, he learned that “corporations are not eleemosynary institutions.” They exist to create value for their owners and investors. At the same time, as an Eagle Scout, he learned “to leave your campsite better than you found it.” And that, according to Quaadman, is what stakeholder capitalism and ESG come down to: “whether a company is being a good corporate citizen and making their portion of the world a better place,” even as they pursue their value creation purpose. What they do with stakeholders must connect to creating long-term value. For Whittaker, stakeholder capitalism reflects continuing shifts in the economic landscape and the general public’s expectation of companies. Every company, he says, “has a&hellip;",

Infrastructure modernization is among a small set of issues that enjoys active bipartisan support. Congress should seize this moment to develop a proposal with input from both parties via the traditional legislative process. There are urgent economic and environmental needs to accelerate the construction of modern, clean and resilient infrastructure. The principles identified below offer a bipartisan foundation for substantive and legislative success. One Investment, Multiple Benefits  Clean, modern infrastructure investments have a strong multiplier effect, improving economic growth, creating millions of good-paying middle-class jobs, protecting our climate and environment and advancing environmental justice. Further Delay Is Not an Option  A major infrastructure investment is essential for our economy and environment. Building infrastructure that reduces greenhouse gas emissions is like putting money into a savings account with a high rate of compound interest; the earlier one makes the investment, the more it will be worth by 2050. Smart and timely investments in clean infrastructure can provide a foundation for achieving climate goals that relies more on innovation and less on taxes and regulation. To get to our destination, we need to answer these three key questions: What is the definition of infrastructure? How do we build it faster? Do we pay for it now or in the future? Defining the Scope  With a potentially large infrastructure bill on the horizon, every stakeholder and interest group is understandably advocating that their priorities be included in the definition of infrastructure. While there is appetite among many in Congress to advance a variety of national interests, we believe Congress should focus infrastructure legislation on the transportation and water systems, high quality broadband, and energy infrastructure needed to increase resiliency, grow the economy, and support the timely and economically viable decarbonization of our economy. Approving and Permitting Projects  The processes to provide project permit approvals at all levels of government are inefficient, creating unnecessary delays that increase project costs, reduce investment, and significantly delay the environmental, societal and economic benefits of new and improved infrastructure. We will not succeed in modernizing the nation’s infrastructure absent equal efforts to modernize the permitting and approval process. The necessary regulatory reforms are significant, requiring difficult trade-offs between climate change goals and issues related to federalism, private property rights and judicial review. Importantly, we can significantly improve the process without changing any of the environmental and safety standards on which permitting and environmental reviews are based. Absent dramatic improvement, important projects and new technologies will sit on the sidelines and achieving net-zero by 2050 will be impossible. Paying for Infrastructure  The nation simply cannot afford to pass another multi-trillion-dollar legislative package absent any reductions in spending or new revenue. While some will certainly argue that the imperative of economic recovery and historically low interest rates justify additional deficit spending, Congress must take meaningful action to offset some or all of these new expenditures. The public sector also should not be expected or forced to foot the bill for these investments alone, nor is that&hellip;",

    "content": "Buried in last month’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan (ARP) was a little-noticed $86 billion bailout for multiemployer union pensions. Democrats, rather than working on a compromise, decided to go it alone, bailing out the plans without any strings attached. It sends a terrible message: underfund your pensions and the feds will come to the rescue, no questions asked. So, how did we get here? These pension programs were in trouble long before the pandemic. Twenty-nine years ago, as Executive Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)—the federal agency that insures corporate pensions—I gave a speech at the AFL-CIO&#8217;s pension conference discussing the need for congressional reform of the troubled PBGC to avoid a future bailout. I stressed that too many people were looking at the finances of the single-employer pension insurance program through rose-colored glasses. President George H.W. Bush’s budget, which had been published the day before, stated: “it is time to stop the band-aid approach to repairs and confront the structural problems of the insurance program once and for all.” Reform of PBGC&#8217;s other program—insurance for multiemployer pensions—had passed several years before that conference. As a result, I said the multiemployer program was a rose in PBGC&#8217;s garden (sticking to the horticulture analogy). But as every gardener knows, rose gardens need sunlight, fertilizing, weeding, and pruning. Congress never gave PBGC adequate tools to tend to the growing multiemployer plan problems. Now, instead of making tough decisions, Congress rammed through a bailout for plan sponsors, employees, and retirees alike—unrestricted fertilizer paid by U.S. taxpayers. Multiemployer plans are collectively bargained pension plans, with many employers sponsoring a single plan. These plans allow union members to move between firms but keep their same pension. There are currently about 1,400 plans covering 10.9 million workers and retirees. The plans have $1.2 trillion in promised benefits, but only $500 billion in assets—42% funded. There are roughly 200 troubled plans, including 50 Teamster plans, which are even further underwater. Many of the plans have been in trouble for years because of shrinking, or even disappearing, industries; lax funding rules; bad investment decisions; and sponsoring employers leaving through bankruptcy, or otherwise, and not paying their fair share. Too often in both single-employer and multiemployer plans, employers offer future pension benefit increases in collective bargaining in lieu of the wage increases that the employer could not afford. In insurance terms, that creates a moral hazard. When pensions are taken over by PBGC, benefits are reduced by law. The reductions are more severe in multiemployer plans than single-employer plans. As head of PBGC, it was never a happy situation for me to see benefits being cut. After all, many retirees have worked a lifetime to receive their pensions. However, painful as reductions are, their prospect does add some discipline to the system by helping to discourage excessive, unfunded pension promises. The ARP’s 30-year multiemployer plan bailout has nothing to do with COVID relief. It removes any disciplines by paying full benefits and even restoring benefits to those&hellip;",

    "content": "HR1—the For the People Act—passed in the House, but it faces additional, perhaps insurmountable hurdles in the Senate. The omnibus elections legislation is so wide ranging that it is unlikely to garner majority support in the Senate, let alone the 60 votes necessary to invoke cloture. The bill’s outlook isn’t an indication that Congress can’t pass meaningful election administration legislation. Rather, it offers an important lesson regarding how today’s Congress should tackle election policy topics. Instead of taking the HR1-style ‘kitchen sink’ approach on democracy reforms, Congress should start with targeted initiatives focused on specific problems. This tactic enhances the possibility of attracting bipartisan support, which in turn maximizes Congress’ ability to make necessary, tangible improvements to the American electoral ecosystem. This is not a new approach to elections legislation. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Susan Collins (R-ME) exemplified this strategy just this month, when they announced the re-introduction of the Invest in Our Democracy Act—a proposal to address some key cybersecurity issues, in a time when cybersecurity remains a pressing election administration concern. The Invest in Our Democracy Act would allocate funds to the Election Assistance Commission to cover up to 75% of the costs for election officials to participate in accredited election administration certificate and cybersecurity programs. Those funds would go primarily to officials in smaller jurisdictions, which tend to have limited resources and, as a result, are most vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. The bill would have an important impact. A recent report from US intelligence officials outlined an attempted—though unsuccessful—foreign interference effort in the 2020 general election. Despite the extant threat, cybersecurity and election administration training programs are often prohibitively expensive for election offices—many of which can barely cover current costs. Easing some of that burden amounts to a smart, impactful investment in our election infrastructure. Importantly, the Invest in Our Democracy Act offers a sensible solution to a specific, bipartisan election policy issue (cybersecurity). It was both crafted and is being introduced in a bipartisan manner. Therein lies the lesson: if Congress only takes the all-or-nothing approach to democracy reforms like in H.R. 1, we’re likely to end up deadlocked and empty handed. Through more targeted legislation like the Invest in Our Democracy Act, Congress can circumnavigate ideological and partisan fissures and, hopefully, pass legislation that strengthens our democratic institutions. That’s not to say HR1’s proposals aren’t important. Issues like partisan gerrymandering, campaign finance, felony disenfranchisement are pressing, foundational, and merit federal attention. But if these are policies over which Congress is sharply divided, tethering them to measures that command broader support (such as voter-verified paper ballots and collecting alternative contact information from voters) diminishes the possibility that any election reforms will pass. Congress has an important role to play in the electoral ecosystem. At its best, federal election policy can provide vital support for the officials and administrators who reliably carry out the defining function of our democratic system. However, in order to do that, it needs to become law. As voting policy and democracy&hellip;",

Each piece of legislation allocates funds through grant and program vehicles. An additional $100 billion has been proposed for high-speed broadband infrastructure and subsidies for internet access as part of the White House&#8217;s American Jobs Plan. Taken altogether, this shows a clear interest by leaders in Washington to address the digital divide for Americans struggling to access online resources. It is also essential that Congress address the underlying issues that define the digital divide and invest in solutions.

    "content": "In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act after almost twenty years of failed legislation and four different attempts at immigration reform. When IRCA eventually passed, it helped legalize almost 3 million undocumented immigrants and imposed stricter restrictions on employers from hiring unauthorized immigrant workers, while trying to secure the U.S.-Mexico border against illegal border crossings. However, IRCA remained relatively ineffective in controlling future unlawful immigration. By not addressing reforms to our legal immigration system or creating new legal pathways for migrants, the U.S. immigration system remained vulnerable to requiring more legalization in the future. Between 1990 and 2007 the U.S. unauthorized population tripled from 3.7 million to 12.2 million, and in 2019, around 10.3 million people were living in the United States without status. Thirty-five years after the passage of IRCA and several attempts over the past few decades1 to pass comprehensive immigration reform, President Joe Biden released and Congress introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021. However, like IRCA, the U.S. Citizenship Act leaves a lot to be desired on the legal immigration front, especially regarding high-skilled and lesser-skilled occupations that are related to future U.S. immigration flows. Without meaningful legal immigration reform, President Biden’s bill may provide an immediate and necessary immigration reset but could likely necessitate another broad legalization in the future. The U.S. Citizenship Act would provide an eight-year track to citizenship to most undocumented immigrants, with 3.3 million unauthorized immigrants eligible for an expedited three-year process. Unauthorized immigrants eligible for a pathway to citizenship include Dreamers, farmworkers, those under the Temporary Protected Status program, and their spouses and children. The bill would also invest a significant number of resources in addressing the root causes of migration from Central America and puts forward a plan for the management of the southern border in hopes of effectively handling future illegal border crossings. However, not creating and implementing new channels for legal immigration across the skill spectrum could mean that unauthorized border crossing is likely to continue. Border Enforcement as a Panacea? Much of the immigration reform debate has emphasized increased border enforcement to address these unauthorized migrations. IRCA set out to eliminate illegal border crossing by supplying new technology and increased border funding and resources, as well as implementing requirements for employers to verify the employment eligibility of all new hires. Similarly, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S.744), which passed the Senate in 2013, also set out to tighten our southern border by increasing enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border, adding additional Border Patrol and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, and including National Guard support for securing the border, as a precursor to providing a pathway for unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 also advances some policy initiatives to manage our southern border by deploying smart technology, which bill sponsors say will help detect and prevent illicit activity, improve situational awareness, and counter transnational crime networks.

    "content": "While the battle against COVID-19 has been the primary focus of emergency management efforts in the U.S. over the past 12 months, we also witnessed one of the most active Atlantic hurricane seasons in memory, saw devasting wildfires in the west that turned skies orange, and watched as many communities suffered extreme weather events involving high winds, intense rain, flooding, and below freezing temperatures. For more than a few jurisdictions, response and recovery demands associated with these events came on top of a string of devasting disasters beginning in 2017 and 2018 with historic hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and Michael, and various California wildfires. All the difficulties of long-term disaster recovery that existed prior to the COVID-19 crisis continue to be present as states, local governments, territories, and tribal governments, or SLTTs, figure out strategies for addressing those needs while being stretched to the limit—sometimes beyond the limit—of their capabilities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is at the center of those efforts, given reliance upon its Public Assistance program to finance post-disaster restoration of infrastructure and the National Flood Insurance Program that aids recovery for participating homeowners. In 2018, Congress enacted the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, or DRRA, which contained program and policy changes focused on FEMA and the Stafford Act. While FEMA’s internal scorecard reflects that virtually all DRRA provisions have been implemented, the outcomes for some major components are likely to be a mixed bag. For instance, DRRA provided states and local governments the option to assume responsibility for post-disaster housing missions. However, uptake has been, and may continue to be, limited given the necessary pre-certification processes and the procurement and stringent cost guidelines that seem to hold states and local jurisdictions to a higher standard than FEMA. Alternatively, the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program has been well received in its inaugural grant cycle given its goal to harden community lifelines, its competitive structure, and a relatively reliable funding stream based upon a percentage of appropriations for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. Yet, since DRRA was FEMA-centric, it failed to address the broader scope of problems with and potential improvements for federal disaster recovery assistance. This sort of full scope review is necessary to make improvements that will ultimately result in better outcomes and longer-term resilience. Many other federal agencies have roles in disaster response that vary depending on the supplemental funding made available by Congress and the policy preferences of different administrations. Congress has shown no inclination to place all recovery eggs solely in FEMA’s basket, notwithstanding the multiple authorities present in the Stafford Act. While the availability of programs outside the FEMA orbit is unpredictable, there are indications that various congressional committees may focus on these uneven aspects of federal disaster recovery policy over the next 18 months. Numerous issues are ripe for this review and, as Congress and the new administration set their agendas, considering a few fundamentals is important before drilling down into programmatic details. A central question is: What can be done&hellip;",

    "content": "Small business is an apple-pie issue. Politicians from every point on the political spectrum love to express rhetorical support for small businesses. In her book, Fintech, Small Business, &#038; the American Dream, Karen Mills, the former head of the Small Business Administration, includes a screen capture from HBO&#8217;s “Last Week Tonight” of dozens of politicians calling small business “the backbone of the economy.” There are dissenters from this general position, but no self-respecting politician would be caught denying the significance of small business to the U.S. economy. Everybody agrees on the importance of small business and entrepreneurship and has to say they agree. Entrepreneurs and small business owners, however, don’t really believe the politicians. In a 2020 Kauffman Foundation survey, 69% of entrepreneurs said they “do not think the government cares about them.” This accords with findings from prior surveys. Why the disconnect? Agreement does not always translate into action, at least action that is meaningful for entrepreneurs and small business owners. Even if both Republicans and Democrats agree on the economic importance of small businesses and entrepreneurs, they may not share an appetite for acting—and they may not agree on what those actions should even be. Over the last year, federal policymakers put pecuniary substance behind their rhetorical support. By allocating around $1 trillion for small business support via the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans, they showed a willingness to act on behalf of small and young companies. That’s the question facing Congress and the Biden Administration. The government cannot keep giving direct financial support to small businesses—not fiscally, or mechanically, given the ongoing implementation challenges. Those billions of dollars supplied through federal legislation operated, for the most part, to positive effect. Yet at some point, public policy needs to turn from rescue and relief to growth and opportunity. And that’s where hard decisions will need to be made, because hoping that $1 trillion in emergency funds bided time for a return to the pre-pandemic status quo is the wrong approach. The last 12 months exposed stark challenges facing entrepreneurs and business owners—all of which existed in February 2020. Deep-seated demographic disparities in business ownership and growth, geographic divergence in rates of new business formation and innovation, narrowing paths of entrepreneurial opportunity for many, and restricted access to finance for many potential business owners. It’s easy to read an overly pessimistic picture into such challenges. There were many positive aspects to America’s small business landscape before the pandemic. In the first quarter of 2020, the Small Business Index produced by MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce hit an all-time high. Rates of business formation and growth by Latinos were running at record levels. Yet the pandemic exposed issues that must be addressed if a strong entrepreneurial recovery is to be realized. We must rethink the orientation of public policy toward small businesses and entrepreneurs—and restructure our programs and systems of support. There’s strong agreement in Washington for acting to support small businesses and entrepreneurship. That’s&hellip;",

    "content": "The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law on March 11, 2021 and includes multiple provisions impacting working families and the child care sector. This is the third major piece of legislation in response to the COVID-19 crisis that addresses the fragility of the child care market and the challenges of working parents in accessing affordable child care. More information can be found in explainers on child care in the CARES Act, passed in March 2020, and on the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA), passed in December 2020. The child care provisions within the ARP include $39 billion in one-time appropriations to the Child Care and Development Block Grant, split into two sections, and a separate, permanent increase to the mandatory Child Care Entitlement to States. Together, these two funding streams are commonly called the Child Care and Development Fund and typically must comply with CCDBG rules and regulations. These combined appropriations represent an increase of roughly 211% above currently enacted levels. A description of each of the child care provisions included in the ARP are included below. Separate from the annual appropriations process, the ARP includes an infusion of one-time emergency funds for fiscal year 2021 through CCDBG to support child care, including funding for essential workers, and places no income limits on families who may receive assistance through these funds. Timeline for Obligation: Available to be obligated in FY2021, FY2022, or FY2023. This adds one year to the typical obligation timeline for CCDBG funding. The funds were provided halfway through FY21 and would have effectively afforded states less time than usual.1 Use of Funds: In addition to supplementing regular CCDBG activities (except as described below), funds are authorized to provide “child care assistance to health care sector employees, emergency responders, sanitation workers, and other workers deemed essential during the response to coronavirus by public officials, without regard to the income eligibility requirements of section 658P(4) of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9858n(4)).” Changes in State Spending: Two sections of underlying CCDBG law are waived for these funds. First, states do not have comply with a rule that requires them to spend 70% of their funding on direct services to families. Second, states do not need to spend at least 12% of their funding on quality improvement activities.2 The ARP also creates a new, one-time grant program whereby the Secretary of Health and Human Services awards each state’s lead agency a child care stabilization grant intended to help child care providers remain financially viable through the remainder of the pandemic. These funds shall be allocated in FY2021 to states using the same formula described under CCDBG, including to territories and tribes.3 The legislation also waives, for these funds, certain underlying rules of CCDBG that (1) require specific set-asides for quality activities and direct services, and (2) allow states to spend up to 5% for administrative costs.4 Each lead agency may reserve up to 10% of the grant funds&hellip;",

    "content": "Equal Pay Day is a sobering reminder of the challenges women face in the labor market and the ongoing gender disparities in the US economy. In 2019, the median earnings of full-time, year-round female workers were 82.3% of that of men. Among the multiple, complex societal and economic factors that contribute to the gender pay gap, caregiving responsibilities impact female earnings by influencing their career choices and causing significant work interruptions. As lawmakers consider options for supporting female advancement in the labor market, expanding paid family leave would increase women&#8217;s labor force attachment, improve their job continuity, and empower them to pursue higher-earning occupations—all helping close the gender pay gap. As increasing numbers of women joined the workforce in the 20th century, many began facing what Isabel Sawhill and Katherine Guyot of the Brookings Institution call “the time squeeze,” and had to make difficult choices in their careers to meet family caregiving demands. Research shows that because of caregiving—particularly for children—women more frequently than men experience career interruptions that can have long-term negative consequences for their earnings. Moreover, women tend to value job qualities that support caregiving, such as job security and workplace flexibility, over more demanding and riskier jobs with higher earnings growth. The combination of these factors contribute to what researchers call the “motherhood wage penalty.” For decades following childbirth, mothers tend to earn lower wages and work less than fathers, as well as both men and women without children. Perhaps at no time has the impact of caregiving on women in the workforce been more apparent than in the face of historic caregiving responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. An October 2020 Pew Research survey found that more mothers than fathers felt that they needed to reduce their work hours (34% vs. 26%) or even turn down a promotion (9% vs. 3%) in order to balance work and parenting responsibilities during the pandemic. A BPC-Morning Consult survey found that women were twice as likely as men to say they left work for caregiving responsibilities due to childcare provider or school closures. As a result, among parent-age workers, women have lagged behind men in the economic recovery and are substantially more likely to remain out of the labor force. In particular, as of February 2021, there has been a loss of about 1.5 million parent-age women from the labor force. Expanding access to paid family leave would both support long-term female workforce outcomes and help women return to the workforce during COVID-19. State-level paid family leave programs increase labor force attachment, hours worked, and earnings among new mothers. Studies show that California’s paid leave program increased weekly work hours of employed mothers by 10% to 17%, and it increased the likelihood of female employment one year after childbirth by 23%. Another study found that women who take paid family leave after giving birth are 40% more likely to return to work than those without the benefit. The benefits of paid family leave also extend beyond just a few years.&hellip;",

    "content": "Since the onset of the pandemic, a greater number of parents have reported that their children ages 3-5 years old are experiencing more social-emotional challenges, including increasing levels of challenging behavior. On top of navigating the ongoing pandemic, this uptick in behavioral issues will present an added difficulty for an already-strained early educator workforce. While early educators are being forced to navigate ongoing external stressors such as low pay, limited benefits, and high turnover, their well-being has significant influence over the mental health and behavioral outcomes of children in their classroom. Children thrive most when relationships with early childhood teachers are stable, responsive, caring, and consistent. When teachers are suffering from depression or job stress, relationships can become disrupted, and children can demonstrate more challenging behaviors that lead to higher levels of expulsion. Conversely, educators that have the capacity to foster supportive relationships with the children see lower rates of challenging behavior in the classroom. Unfortunately, even before the pandemic, there were limited federal investments to support early childhood educators who needed or wanted additional resources to respond to their own personal stressors or the challenging behaviors presented in their classrooms. Accessible and age-appropriate interventions can be implemented to support teachers and children, and could successfully reduce the rates of exclusionary discipline, such as expulsion and suspension, in early learning settings. These practices disproportionately impact marginalized populations, such as children with disabilities, children from low-income families, and children of color. To address rates of exclusionary discipline, some initial action has been taken. Some states and Head Start programs leveraged legislative or regulatory changes to restrict the use of harsh discipline in early education. However, these restrictions do not necessarily provide educators and children with alternative options for managing behavioral challenges and promoting everyone’s well-being. In 2014, the federal government promoted the use of early childhood mental health consultations, or ECMHC, to reduce rates of exclusionary discipline and a myriad of states have begun implementing ECMHC. Thus far, one randomized control trial has been published based on Connecticut’s successful efforts to implement ECMHC through their statewide program: the Early Childhood Consultation Partnership. That randomized control trial, conducted by Dr. Walter Gilliam at Yale University, found that the program significantly decreased the levels of problem behaviors children were exhibiting. Despite promising evidence, there has been a chronic underinvestment in systematic mental health supports in early education and care settings. Successful or widespread implementation is further complicated by a national workforce shortage of early childhood mental health professionals. Most recently, the American Rescue Plan, which includes a total of $39 billion in child care funding, includes “mental health supports for children and employees” as an allowable use of the $25 billion in stabilization funds. But with a range of competing priorities, states and providers may struggle to leverage the money for this purpose. On March 26, 2021 BPC’s Early Childhood Initiative will host Dr. Walter Gilliam and Dr. Chin Reyes, who recently completed a second randomized control trial studying ECMHC in Ohio. Their&hellip;",

    "content": "We’re seeing something new with governments and higher education governance in the last five years: government wading into the quality and character of academic discourse on the nation’s campuses. This is truly a new development. Before World War II, governments at all levels tended to leave higher education institutions alone to govern themselves. This hands-off attitude persisted even after the federal government assumed a role in higher education by becoming a significant funder of higher education through the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944—better known as the G.I. Bill—and the post-Sputnik National Defense Education Act of 1958. One exception to this hands-off approach was the adoption of loyalty oaths at public universities and private universities receiving NDEA funds, a few of which still exist to this day. These loyalty oaths were controversial at the time—with the defenders and opponents of such oaths replaying debates that fueled the McCarthy bitterness of the early 1950s—but attempts to strip them from the NDEA failed in Congress. The government continued to hold itself at a remove from higher education governance even as federal funding of higher education reached $75 billion in 2017, allowing higher education institutions themselves, alongside accrediting agencies, to assess academic matters and educational quality. Again, there were some exceptions, notably Title IX sex-discrimination provisions and Title IV student-loan programs. This hands-off approach has started to change, as heightened controversy about the status of free expression on campus has caught the attention of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. and in several states. Lawmakers have responded with various approaches. It is not clear, however, how government can affect the campus environment for open inquiry and free expression significantly through legislation, executive action, or regulation. This blog series comes in several parts: first, a survey of legislative and regulatory steps that have occurred or are proposed on the federal level. Next, a similar survey of state-level statutes and interventions on campus. Finally, an analysis of the nature and limits of legislative and regulatory strategies affecting colleges and universities’ free expression climates. President Barack Obama made headlines when he made open inquiry and free expression a point in his 2016 commencement address at Howard University, at the end of the 2015–16 academic year that saw an uptick in free expression controversies, including at the University of Missouri, Dartmouth College, and Yale University. Obama said: Our democracy gives us a process designed for us to settle our disputes with argument and ideas and votes instead of violence and simple majority rule. So don’t try to shut folks out, don’t try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There&#8217;s been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view, or disrupt a politician’s rally. Don’t do that—no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. But using the bully pulpit, the Obama administration did not seek to intervene in this aspect of college governance, though&hellip;",

Our big reads are two major reports, one on the pressures faced by conservative academics and students, the other about campus expression climate. Viewpoint Neutrality Now! v. Regents of University of Minnesota United States District Court for the District of Minnesota | February 1, 2021 A federal judge has ruled that plaintiffs Viewpoint Neutrality Now! may proceed with their case against the University of Minnesota. The lawsuit alleges that the university practices viewpoint discrimination in how it distributes funds among, and allocates campus space to, student organizations. The court’s ruling emphasizes that the university’s rules giving certain school officials “unbridled discretion” may be unconstitutional, writing “the discretion of the decision-maker who allocated the space in was about as ‘unbridled’ as unbridled discretion gets.” LGBTQ students at BYU light up the ‘Y’ in Rainbow Colors Courtney Tanner | Salt Lake Tribune | March 5, 2021 Students held up rainbow-colored lights on a trail above Brigham Young University. “When they returned to the trailhead, there were some police cars from the university in the parking lot. But no individuals were stopped or questioned. … The school added in a later tweet Thursday that ‘any form of public expression on university property requires prior approval.’ Still, the display had so much support that the students were also greeted on their way down by fans, who circled in their cars blasting songs, including ‘Born This Way’ and ‘I Kissed a Girl,’ from their speakers.” 200+ Faculty Across U.S. Launch Non-partisan Academic Freedom Alliance Press Release | Academic Freedom Alliance | March 8, 2021 “More than 200 college and university faculty members across the United States joined together to launch the Academic Freedom Alliance (AFA), a non-profit and non-partisan organization dedicated to upholding the principle of free speech in academia. In addition to promoting solidarity, the AFA will provide legal support to certain faculty whose academic freedom is under attack. … While membership is currently by invitation only, the AFA plans to open membership to all faculty at U.S. colleges and universities in the future.” LSU Could Lose State Funding Over Book Discussion Fred Childers | BRProud | February 25, 2021 A Louisiana state legislator publicly criticized a February Louisiana State University book event on The Religion of White Rage: Religious Fervor, White Workers and the Myth of Black Racial Progress. The lawmaker expressed concerns that the discussion did not present “a balanced approach” to the topic. “As chairman of the House Education Committee the lawmaker oversees many aspects of education in the state, including funding, and hints at a possible reduction of state funds for LSU.” Montana House Bill 349 67th Montana State Legislature | February 24, 2021 The legislation prevents public universities from discriminating against “a student organization based on the student organization’s&hellip;",

    "content": "In late December 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $10 billion for child care. This relief funding is administered to states through the Child Care and Development Block Grant with broad flexibility over how it may be spent, similar to the CARES Act funding approved in March 2020. As with the CARES Act funding, states can support a wide range of activities with the funds. This 50-state analysis tracks how states are spending their CRRSA child care funding in 2021 and builds on previous tracking of how states spent their CARES Act funding—both CCDBG and other sources—during 2020. States were required to submit a plan for their use of CRRSA funds to the Department of Health and Human Services by February 26, 2021. However, as of March 17, as few as 13 states and the District of Columbia had publicly released plans for allocating their funding. This is due in part to the quick timeline required under law, but also because  43 states experience some level of restriction on how they can obligate federal funding that is unanticipated, including 19 states which must receive legislative approval before spending any unanticipated funds such as those in the CRRSA. Only four of those 19 states—Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Texas—had announced plans for their supplemental funds as of March 17. On March 24, HHS published each state’s letter describing how they plan to spend CRRSA funds. The letters included varying levels of certainty and specificity, many noting that state legislative processes would ultimately determine use of funds. Nebraska, for instance, indicated it was waiting for guidance from HHS before fully developing their plans. Each states’ plan is detailed in the map below. Additionally, the accompanying spreadsheet enumerates how many states plan to engage in certain activities. Of states with plans: All but one—Alaska—intends to offer grants to providers to assist with covering costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty states plan to use their funds to cover parent copayments. Fourteen states announced they will increase subsidy reimbursement rates and 12 will offer payments based on enrollment, not attendance, both to better support providers. Kansas, Missouri, and New Mexico will support investments in child care facilities, while 17 states will use funds to expand supply of child care. Thirteen states will offer mental health supports More than half of states will use funds to support the child care workforce . Fourteen are using funds specifically to support providers who serve school-aged children. States are also using funds in creative ways. For instance: North Carolina and Kansas are purchasing clear masks for child care staff to promote safety while simultaneously ensuring children are comfortable and can learn social skills from their teachers. Indiana is developing shared substitute teacher pools and helping individuals to fulfill substitute teacher requirements. Louisiana will establish a microloan pilot program for child care businesses. Colorado and Connecticut are supporting family child care providers through networks and navigators. Learn more on the map and spreadsheet below. 236",

    "content": "Last week, Congress passed, and President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act into law, which included an historic uptick in funding for families and the child care sector—funding four times the amount of money provided in the 2020 December COVID-19 relief package, and significantly more money than has ever been provided by the annual, federal appropriations process ($5.8 billion was appropriated for the Child Care and Development Block Grant in fiscal year 2021). While this injection of cash is likely appreciated, state child care administrators will find themselves as gatekeepers because this funding will need to be channeled through states before reaching providers and families. It is the largest influx of child care funds to date that states have ever needed to administer. The ARP includes: $14 billion appropriated through the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and $23.97 billion appropriated through a new child care stabilization fund. Attached to this new funding is an added sense of urgency for states to authorize how the stabilization money will be spent quickly. There is a provision in the law requiring obligation of the money within the next two years and a requirement that states report to the Department of Health and Human Services within nine months of enactment (by December 2021) whether they are unable to spend 50% of their allotted stabilization funding. In light of the strains COVID-19 has placed on families &#8211; especially women &#8211; and the child care sector, it is understandable that Congress, providers, and advocates should want to see the money spent quickly. And while some state agencies will be able to work expeditiously, others could face legislative obstacles that will make it difficult to authorize spending the money in a timely manner. According to 2015 data from the National Association of State Budget Officers, and displayed in the table below,19 states must receive legislative approval before spending any unanticipated funds.1 For example, in Oregon, the executive branch is required to make a request to the legislative branch to increase any expenditure authority. Source: National Association of State Budget Officers Budget Processes in the States (Spring 2015) &nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, some states are still facing challenges in spending the $10 billion provided for child care in the December aid package. A recent case study in Idaho found that despite the state receiving $58 million in child care funding from the December relief deal, the legislature only authorized the Governor to spend $24 million, or half of what the federal government gave the state, while the remaining funding was allocated as a state budget line item that cannot be spent until July 2021. These checks and balances at the state-level, while important for accountability, could further complicate the ability for executive agencies to spend the new ARP funding quickly. Idaho is not an isolated or exceptional incidence—43 states experience some level of restriction placed on their authority to spend unanticipated funding (see Table 1 above). While not all of the minor restrictions directly apply to&hellip;",

    "content": "The American Rescue Plan, signed into law last week, provides $40 billion in emergency funding for higher education to mitigate the pandemic’s effect on college and university finances and help campuses return to normal instruction. These resources will be distributed to institutions, and schools must use at least half to provide emergency aid to students facing financial insecurity as a result of COVID-19. Yet, more can be done to support students in the long term. While there are reasonable objections to the bill’s generosity—particularly given that the Congressional Budget Office estimates colleges will continue to spend down these resources several years into the future—the legislation provides a blueprint for a federal-state partnership upon which policymakers should expand. State funding for higher education tends to fall during recessions, and often fails to recover before the next crisis hits. The ARP provides additional federal support for education, but also implements a “maintenance of effort” provision requiring states to maintain existing funding levels in order to qualify for these new federal resources. This is similar to the federal-state partnership proposed by BPC’s Task Force on Higher Education Financing and Student Outcomes, which lays out a durable approach to ensuring consistent resources for higher education in order to promote student affordability and success. Under BPC’s proposal, funding would flow to states as an annual block grant allocated based on measures of affordability, efficiency, and state tax effort. This would reward states with low net prices for low- and middle-income students, those that invest in higher education relative to their resource constraints, and states that demonstrate high rates of degree completion per $100,000 in institutional revenues. For every additional dollar a state invests in higher education over a three-year rolling average, the federal government would provide $4 in matching funds. The matching funds can be used to reduce unmet student need and improve outcomes for low- and middle-income students, but states would retain a high degree of flexibility on how to achieve these goals. One option would be providing additional investment in College Promise programs, which reduce or eliminate tuition for students. Finally, in order to account for the countercyclical nature of higher education funding, states would be required to set aside a portion of their federal grant into a rainy day fund that can be drawn upon in the event of an economic downturn. While there are many federal-state models to consider—including a bipartisan bill introduced in the 116th Congress—a permanent financing relationship between the two levels of government would ultimately reduce the need for Congress to govern by crisis. We urge policymakers to work across the aisle to develop a sustainable and data-driven approach to higher education policy that provides consistent investment and supports underserved students.",

Beneath the headline figures, however, is the continuation of a troubling trend in labor force participation that has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, parent-age women are substantially more likely than parent-age men to remain out of the labor force. While changes in the gender toplines have largely mirrored each other since the beginning of the pandemic, the same is not true among adults ages 20 to 44 who are most likely to have young children: Around the time schools restarted last fall, but remained closed for in-person learning, the female labor force participation rate among parent-age workers began lagging the male rate in their recovery to pre-pandemic levels. As of February 2021, the labor force participation rate of parent-age women remains 2.7 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level, compared to 1.6 percentage points for parent-age men. Among parent-age adults, these differences between pre-pandemic and current labor force participation rates equates to a loss of about 1.5 million female workers and 870,000 male workers. Existing evidence suggests that the combination of historic caregiving responsibilities and job loss during the pandemic could be behind this gender divergence. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many have focused on the unique challenges that female workers face that have impeded participation in the labor force, including disproportionate job loss and historic caregiving responsibilities. To start, Chart 1 contains the cumulative monthly percentage point change in the topline rate by gender since the month preceding the pandemic, February 2020. Of note, the topline rate accounts for all workers 16 and over. Although women were slightly more likely than men to remain out of the labor force by February 2021, change in the female rate has largely tracked that of the male rate. Through the first few months of the pandemic, the labor force participation rates among both men and women declined precipitously, corresponding with the massive job loss occurring at the time. Labor force participation for both genders rebounded through the spring and summer and then stagnated into the fall and winter. As of February 2021, the female and male rates were 2.0 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points lower than in February 2020, respectively. Because the topline labor force participation figures include workers of all ages 16 and over, they likely mask the outcomes of working parents who are facing heightened caregiving responsibilities. To provide a better sense of the outcomes for these workers, Chart 2 examines changes among workers who are mostly likely to have young children, those ages 20 to 44.1 Examining this population reveals a sizeable and persistent gap between men and women. Similar to labor force participation of all ages, the decline and subsequent rebound for men and women largely mirrored each other through the summer. However, at the transition from summer to fall—corresponding with schools restarting but remaining remote—labor force participation among women stagnated while it continued&hellip;",

    "content": "In 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program provided almost 43,000 child care providers across the country with at least $2.3 billion in funding, and allowed almost 460,000 child care workers to keep their jobs, according to our analysis of data released by the Small Business Administration. This funding represents less than 1% (0.44%) of the total $525 billion in lending through the program, a small amount for such an essential industry. In all, less than 7% of the over 670,000 child care businesses received a PPP loan. While we do not have data on the number of child care programs that applied for the PPP, it is clear that only a very small number of the potential applicants received much needed support. The loan program did, however, help to retain about 30% of the child care workforce, helping curb the significant number of child care staff who lost their job during the pandemic. Comparatively, across all 50 states, the SBA estimates that between 72% to 96% of small business payroll was covered by the PPP. The vast majority of loans to child care providers were under $150,000, with only 10% of loans above this threshold. Nationwide, for loans under $150,000, the average amount provided through the PPP to child care providers was almost $37,000. 232 233 From our analysis, states receiving the most PPP funds for child care were, not surprisingly, California, Texas, and New York, where in each state, programs received amounts totaling more than $180 million. Similar trends are apparent in overall PPP loan data. In contrast, states receiving the least include Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming, where in each state, programs received loans totaling under $7 million. Child care providers accessing the PPP were almost entirely for-profit businesses, and were more likely to be for-profit than the overall industry. Just 10% of recipients reported non-profit status, lower than the overall industry makeup in which about 23% are non-profit businesses. Overall, the child care child care industry received similar total funding as sectors such as public administration, management, and utilities companies, but received more total loans than these industries, indicating recipients applied for smaller amounts on average. At the same time, the size of the child care industry is disproportionately large when compared to these sectors, suggesting inequitable access to PPP funds for child care programs. This data also supports our previous concerns about the program, and responses from previous surveys of providers documenting challenges in accessing and benefiting from the PPP. As of August 8, the PPP closed to new loan applications with almost $134 billion in available funding, but the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, passed in December 2020, reopened the PPP through March 31, 2021. The law also increased the program’s total authorization from $659 billion to $806.45 billion, and included reforms such as allowing businesses who have already received a loan to receive a “second-draw” of up to $2 million. On February 22, in an attempt to support our nation’s smallest companies, and ensure that lenders could appropriately work with such&hellip;",

    "content": "Policymakers are increasingly paying attention to and advancing policy on the development and use of artificial intelligence. The technology’s many applications have the potential to greatly benefit society and the economy, but also could pose a potential risk to privacy. Further, while the technologies could do much to reduce bias, if not executed properly, they could exacerbate existing discriminatory practices. AI technologies are not entirely independent actors beyond our control. We can build the tools and shape the policy that will guide their development. The new administration and Congress should take a bipartisan approach to assessing these technologies and if appropriate, place guardrails around AI that reduce its risks but allow it to fulfill its potential. Ever since the term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956, there has been no consensus over a formal definition. While the debate over what constitutes AI has continued to evolve, the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act stipulated that the meaning of AI can be inclusive of the following: Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets. An artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action. An artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks. A set of techniques, including machine learning, that is designed to approximate a cognitive task. An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision making, and acting. AI has become a salient policy issue partly because its applications have the potential to cut across every area of our lives—such as healthcare, education, finance, and criminal justice. Some applications are more innocuous, like algorithms that use data from your past views or purchases as a basis to make movie recommendations, or online chat assistants that learn from previous help requests to navigate a user through a webpage. However, many of AI’s use cases, such as algorithms used to allocate medical resources or autonomous weapons systems, are highly consequential for society, the economy, and national security. To seize the opportunities presented by beneficial uses of AI, such as tracking the spread of the pandemic or personalizing online education, policymakers need to be mindful of the risks, like privacy violations presented by facial recognition or biased data worsening racial disparities in criminal justice. As such, there are several relevant AI-related policy issues that require consideration. Ethics AI’s potential to vastly impact quality of life raises important ethical questions, such as how to address bias, promote fairness, and protect privacy. Lawmakers need to consider what a fair use of AI is and how human values of fairness can be embedded into AI systems. Encouraging the development of standards framework, common terminology, and best practices through a multi-disciplinary approach will be important&hellip;",

    "content": "The latest FCC report on broadband services estimated that 19 million Americans still lack access to high-speed internet services. A recent Bloomberg analysis found evidence suggesting the true figure of offline households was likely double the FCC’s estimates. While the digital divide pre-dated the pandemic, having so much of American life shifted online—from education to work to medicine—has highlighted and exacerbated many existing broadband access issues. Much of the focus on the digital divide has centered on the gulf between rural and urban areas. However, census data revealed that while approximately 5 million rural households do not have access to broadband, this problem is three times as large in urban areas—with around 15 million urban or metro households without broadband. Yet the reasons for this digital divide is not the same in rural and urban areas. In rural areas, coverage and affordability are the challenges. In urban and metro communities, digital literacy and education are the principal reasons.. Policymakers must understand these differences and encourage tailored solutions. Residential access to broadband has become exponentially more important to how Americans work and learn. An internet connection, at sufficient speed, is critical for innovation, jobs, upward mobility, and improved quality of life. Policymakers of both parties, and the FCC, have made universal broadband access a priority. Broadband refers to the transmission of data over a high-speed internet connection. The FCC has benchmarked this at a minimum of 25 megabits per second (mbps) download and 3 mbps upload, which is around 125 times faster than the latency requirements two decades ago. Broadband can be delivered in various ways: A digital subscriber line (DSL) which transmits data over traditional copper phone lines. Cable based internet connections run on the same lines that deliver television to a house. The speed tends to vary based on the number of users on that service at a certain point in time. Fiber optic cables transmit data using pulses of light sent through fiber strands. It is the newest broadband service and, while much faster and more secure than other systems, is less available due to the time it takes to lay the cables. Wireless broadband delivery, which differs from wireless internet service by using a wireless connection for the last mile and a cable or DSL for the rest. It is more common in larger settings, like college campuses or downtown cities. Satellite broadband uses orbiting satellites to provide internet coverage and is most common in rural or sparsely populated areas. This coverage is slower than other broadband types and can be disrupted by poor weather conditions that block the sky. When thinking about digital inclusion, policymakers must broaden the focus from broadband infrastructure and access to include education and digital literacy. Pew Research has found that broadband non-adoption rates are higher among older, poorer, and less educated groups as well as communities of color. Urban areas are more likely to have clusters that fit these demographics, which is why, by population, the digital divide is three times&hellip;",

The commission will play a critical role in ongoing discussions about the role of corporations in American society and how they address and disclose Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. BPC suggests the following questions for Mr. Gensler: 1. Stakeholder Capitalism vs Shareholder Capitalism: In 2019, the Business Roundtable (BRT) created shockwaves here in DC with a statement about the purpose of corporations. Specifically, their assertion that all relevant stakeholders (communities; suppliers; customers; along with shareholders) should be a priority. While some referred to it as a sea change on how we view corporations, others insisted that engaging with all relevant stakeholders was the hallmark of well-run companies. Assuming stakeholder capitalism continues to be at the forefront of discussions, how should companies prioritize stakeholders when conflicts arise between them? Should Boards and Management continue to have a fiduciary to maximize returns for shareholders or does stakeholder capitalism require a new definition of their fiduciary duty? Does proliferation of stakeholder capitalism theory undermine the distinction between traditional corporations and B-corporations? This year we have seen extraordinary social upheaval in the wake of the pandemic. In response, we have heard a lot of talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion. What responsibility do companies bear for addressing these types of social concerns? How should these concerns be evaluated regarding all stakeholders? 2. ESG Disclosure: The Supreme Court indicated that companies should disclose financially material information where there is a &#8220;substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important&#8221; in making investment decisions, though cautioned against too much disclosed information. In 2010, the SEC provided guidance regarding disclosure related to climate change. In that guidance, the Commission explained that existing disclosure requirements includes the costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulation, legal proceedings, risk factors, management discussions and analysis (MD&amp;A), technological innovation, and international agreements. Just last week, acting SEC Chair Allison Herren Lee indicated that the SEC will update the 2010 guidance to create &#8220;a more comprehensive framework that produces consistent, comparable, and reliable climate-related disclosures.&#8221; Does the existing SEC disclosure framework provide for financially material disclosure? If not, what existing statutory authority would justify expanding the current disclosure requirements? While there is a growing interest in evermore amounts of information related to ESG disclosure, how will you balance the desire for increasing amounts of information with a company’s duty to disclose only financially material information in order to avoid the concern the Supreme Court had with too much information for the investor to evaluate? Given the differences between the US and Europeans approaches on corporate disclosure, what is the feasibility of a global standard without statutory changes? Do you believe the SEC should consider modifying the definition of materiality to include &#8220;double” or &#8220;dual” materiality, which includes both material information on&hellip;",

    "content": "Nearly a year of K-12 school closures have caused serious disruptions to an important developmental period for our country’s children. Researchers predict that these disruptions will have serious consequences for America’s economic future. But getting our children back on track will take more than addressing the learning deficits incurred during the pandemic. America must also confront a deeper, more entrenched education problem—one that has put our country’s students behind those from other countries for decades—which, to solve, will require supporting children through another critical developmental period: a child’s years from birth through five. Researchers, parents, and policymakers increasingly express concern that the pandemic is leaving children devoid of the academic and social experiences they need during a critical developmental period. Since schools in the United States have remained online for far longer than expected, there is worry that, even with transitions to remote school formats, learning deficits formed over the past year may produce lasting behavioral and cognitive setbacks. Setbacks which could lead to an unprepared workforce and threaten America’s competitive standing. Statistical models estimating the effects of learning losses associated with the shift to online school formats indicate that students who did not return to in-person school until January 2021 could lose $61,000 to $82,000 in lifetime earnings and that the U.S. could lose 0.8% to 1.3% in gross domestic product per year by 2040, when many of today’s K-12 students will have entered the workforce. While this is a serious concern for America’s future, our country faces an even more disturbing educational reality: prior to the pandemic, the United States’ educational standing had already fallen significantly behind other developed countries. The most recent Program for International Student Assessment data released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, shows U.S. students ranking far below other developed countries in educational preparedness. Only 68% of U.S. students met the OECD’s basic proficiency standards in reading, math, and science, whereas 76% of students in Canada and 94% of students in China did so. Unfortunately, these shortcomings are not new. As BPC discussed in 36 Years Later: A Nation Still at Risk, researchers identified these deficiencies more than four decades ago. Since then, policymakers have implemented numerous education reforms at the local, state, and federal levels. Yet, the issue remains intractable. Wealthier students in the United States tend to perform at levels comparable to those in other high-performing countries, but students from low-income families do not. Despite significant strategic and financial investment in education from 2003 to 2017, a recent analysis of scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress —a well-recognized measure of U.S. student achievement—reveals that achievement gaps between eighth graders from lower and higher income brackets have “remained substantial” through this time period. As BPC has said before, the problem is not that America’s schools are failing all students. Rather, the problem is that the nation is not providing an equal educational opportunity for all students. Such achievement gaps threaten not only the country’s economic growth—estimates suggest&hellip;",

    "content": "Voter confidence took a hit during the contentious 2020 election cycle. There are real discussions to be had around what the most urgent vulnerabilities are in U.S. elections today. However, one thing is abundantly clear: Congress must play a vital role in bolstering the security and integrity of our elections. The House is set to vote this week on a wide-ranging set of proposals aimed at transforming how elections are administered with the For The People Act of 2021, or H.R. 1. Due to the decentralized nature of voting, Congress must proceed cautiously when mandating sweeping changes to states’ long-standing election administration policies. It is crucial that any changes made will strengthen the actual security of the reformed process as well as its integrity. Changes should bolster voters’ confidence that the new procedures will yield trustworthy results. The Bipartisan Policy Center has endorsed many of the election integrity and security provisions in H.R. 1, including mandating and funding absentee ballot tracking programs and voter-verifiable paper ballots. However, some provisions in the House bill are potentially impractical, misguided, and risk perpetuating the chronic underfunding of election infrastructure. Below are some of the well-intentioned provisions that, with modification at the federal level or consideration in state legislatures, would shore up both the security and integrity of our elections. Absentee Ballot Tracking Program A record 46% of voters nationwide cast absentee or by-mail ballots in the 2020 election cycle. H.R. 1 would make many of the state-level policies that facilitated this increase the national standard. To help cultivate public confidence in mail-in voting options, Section 1622 would require states to establish programs for voters to track and confirm the status of their absentee ballots. BPC considers absentee ballot tracking systems to be a best practice for mail-in voting. Allowing voters to confirm their ballot was received and processed (or made aware of any issues),will combat uncertainty and increase voter confidence. While BPC believes most election policy changes should come at the state level, H.R. 1 includes a specific authorization to federally fund this measure. States would establish their own ballot tracking programs (within the statutory guidelines) and the federal government would cover some, or all, of the cost. H.R. 1 caps funding for absentee tracking programs at $3,000 total per jurisdiction. For larger jurisdictions or jurisdictions with no existing program in place, this figure is likely to fall short of the total cost burden. Confidence in electoral outcomes diminished significantly in 2020, but ballot tracking programs allow Congress to materially improve perceptions of security without forcing major changes as unfunded mandates. Voter-Verified Paper Ballots and Hand Recounts Despite the rapid movement towards absentee voting, most Americans still voted in-person during the 2020 election.. H.R. 1 seeks to preserve the security of in-person voting by requiring all voting systems used in federal elections to produce voter-verifiable paper ballots. In a voter-verifiable paper ballot system, voters mark and verify paper copies of their ballots before inserting them into a scanning machine at their polling place.&hellip;",

    "content": "Voter registration is a fundamental component of our election ecosystem that requires regular maintenance to be effective. As Congress debates the For The People Act, or H.R.1, a bill that would dramatically alter the American voting experience, it is fair to ask whether those changes would be an improvement everywhere. Overlaying federal mandates on top of a decentralized electoral system risks stressing already under-resourced jurisdictions, resulting in voter confusion, impossible-to-meet federal guidelines, and potential disenfranchisement. Most of H.R. 1’s voter registration mandates are good policy in line with recommendations of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Task Force on Elections. However, enacting them at the federal level without proper resources would create an administrative burden that will diminish any realized benefits. H.R. 1 addresses several key areas of voter registration, but as laid out below, could address certain aspects better. Online Voter Registration Online voter registration is not new. In fact, 40 states and the District of Columbia already have it in some format. The Presidential Commission on Election Administration recommended it in 2014, and BPC recommended it in 2014 and 2020. In 2021, voters expect to electronically transact with the government in a safe and secure manner. Despite its benefits, H.R. 1 fails to address the lack of requirement to link states’ online voter registration systems to other state databases, like the Department of Motor Vehicles, for near-instant identification verification. This link is vital to securing an election system where administrators can confirm eligibility and avoid issues during the voting process. Overall, online voter registration is a policy all states can, and must, adopt. Collecting Alternative Contact Information from Voters H.R. 1 would require the collection of voter email addresses at the time of registration. This seemingly minor change would have outsized benefits by drastically reducing the time it takes for election officials to contact voters. Currently, many election administrators rely on the U.S. Postal Service for communication with voters. It can be a slow exchange during time-sensitive windows, especially for states that allow ballot envelope curing. BPC endorsed email collection as a more rapid alternative to USPS, with the addendum that personally identifiable information not be publicly disclosable. This minor change—one that Congress can mandate by updating the National Voter Registration Act—would immediately yield better voter outcomes. Automatic Voter Registration Automatic voter registration (AVR) has become an unnecessary flashpoint in recent years. H.R. 1 includes a version of AVR consistent with BPC’s recommendation to offer potential voters the ability to opt-out at the point of service, instead of the more passive opt-in registration processes used in most states. Other versions of AVR happen behind the scenes without the individual’s knowledge. We think such a “back-end” AVR system is not possible in all states at current capacity. In BPC’s view, AVR should simply integrate voter registration into other state point-of-service transactions—like at the DMV or social service agencies—with no option to bypass the voter registration questions without a response from the citizen. This would result in nearly-complete voter rolls, inclusive of&hellip;",

    "content": "Comprehensive immigration reform in the United States has been a challenging issue for decades. Recently, the Biden administration signaled a broad immigration reform bill that included a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people. An official bill was introduced by Democrats in the House and Senate on February 18, but it is difficult to see an easy path for this legislation to advance in Congress as written. While the verdict is still out on whether Congress will enact comprehensive immigration reform this year, smaller, stand-alone bipartisan bills may be better vehicles for improving our broken immigration system. Such bipartisan bills could include the Dream Act of 2021, the Farm Workers Modernization Act of 2019, Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act of 2020, and Citizenship for Essential Workers Act of 2021. On February 4, 2020, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) called on the Senate to end the 20 year stalemate around immigration legislation and pass the latest bipartisan version of the Dream Act of 2021. The re-introduction of the bill received widespread encouragement, including from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The bill provides immigrants brought to the United States as children a legal path towards permanent residency and citizenship. Recent polling suggests passing legislation legalizing “DREAMers” has wide public support across party lines. While approximately 84% of the American public overall supported providing a pathway to legal status for “Dreamers” in 2018, that favorability has gone up in subsequent years. Currently, 95% of Democrats, 84% of Independents, and 73% of Republicans support Dreamers and want to see legislation that puts this group on a path towards legalization. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that under the Dream Act of 2021, approximately 2.9 million people could meet the age and residential eligibility for permanent residency, while 1.7 million people may be eligible for a green card under the bill’s additional criteria. Currently, qualifying undocumented immigrants can apply for the Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrivals program, but its fate has been precarious due to numerous court challenges; an outstanding case in Texas federal court could still rule that the DACA program was unlawful. However, even with multiple court cases against the program, DACA is popular, with around 650,000 participants as of June 2020. Most DACA recipients are from Mexico followed by El Salvador, and DACA recipients are known to have jobs with high skills and higher levels of education than undocumented immigrants who are ineligible for the program. But many DACA recipients still continue to live in fear, uncertain if the program will remain in effect year after year with multiple court hearings. The DREAM Act of 2021 would end this uncertainty and put a big group of qualified individuals on a path towards legal status. Introduced in 2019, The Farm Workforce Modernization Act sought to implement reforms to the preexisting H-2A visa for agricultural guest workers as well as provide a path to citizenship for many undocumented agricultural workers. The bipartisan bill, which was supported by both farmworker advocates and farm owners, passed the House in&hellip;",

    "content": "On the first day of his administration, President Joe Biden announced he would send a sweeping immigration bill, the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, to Congress. After four years of increasing division and polarization surrounding immigration policy, Congressional Democrats unveiled the bill on February 18, which was applauded as a significant step towards ensuring that immigration reform remains top of mind for the new administration and the 117th Congress. As outlined in the White House’s fact sheet, the 350-page bill1 introduced by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Rep. Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.) champions significant and long-needed reforms, including a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants; proposes clearing the family and employment-based visa backlogs by recapturing unused visas from prior years; and addressing the root causes of Central American migration via a $4 billion, four-year inter-agency plan. While these reforms are an important priority for modernizing our immigration system, the bill fell short in addressing long-term reforms of the employment-based visa system for lesser-skilled workers. With the bill facing an uphill battle on account of extremely narrow margins in both the House and Senate, congressional Democrats will likely need to make adjustments to aspects of the bill, if they hope to get it over the finish line, especially in the space of legal immigration reform.2 Here is what the bill does and does not address for lesser-skilled legal immigration reform and what solutions and opportunities congressional Democrats could consider when negotiating with their Republican colleagues across the aisle. While the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 outlines important reforms for agriculture and undocumented workers already in the United States, and increases over all green-card numbers, it does not make any major reforms to the existing permanent or temporary worker visa categories. For example, while the proposed legislation increases the base number for the calculation of the annual ceiling for the admission of employment-based immigrants from 140,000 to 170,000 green cards, it does not make any changes to temporary worker categories or their caps. The H-2B program is not addressed in the bill. While additional green cards are welcome, most employers do not hire foreign workers directly on green cards; most immigrants start on temporary visas before employers are willing to sponsor them. For example, there is no change to the numerical 66,000 cap that applies to the H-2B visa. In recent years, the demand for H-2B visas has far exceeded their cap, leaving employers struggling to find a sufficient workforce. With the number of migrants arriving at the southwest border increasing in recent months, the Biden administration will need to contend with longer term solutions to manage migration at the border. Removing existing barriers and establishing more avenues for legal, lesser-skilled immigration to the United States could be a mechanism to do so, especially as small businesses struggled to fill seasonal jobs with native-born employees. In the days since the bill has been introduced, it has received significant pushback from Republican members of Congress. While Democrats are hoping to push&hellip;",

    "content": "In our previous posting, we walked through what earmarks were, what happened to them, and the consequences of their removal. We concluded that the elimination of earmarks disincentivized lawmaking and bipartisanship and, contrary to common belief, did not reduce deficits and spending. We also argued that only in a few egregious circumstances, which could be avoided with reforms, were outright products of corruption. Given the undesirable consequences of their elimination, it makes sense to consider how earmarks could be restored, and with them, Congress’ constitutional authorities and duties. In this blog, we examine one reason members may be hesitant to restore their power to direct federal funds: the majority of members have no first-hand experience with the practice. Additionally, we provide recommendations for their return that would make them less susceptible to corruption and more accountable and transparent to the American taxpayer. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s recommendation for a reformed system of earmarks is based on four key principles: Fiscal responsibility – The banning of earmarks has done nothing to reduce federal spending or decrease the national debt. Greater accountability – Unelected officials in the executive branch bureaucracy now have greater control over federal spending. The president can easily put his or her mark on the federal budget while Congress has delegated its power of the purse. Responsiveness to Local Needs –The Constitution intentionally gave Congress the authority to direct how money should be expended. Over decades, members have directed thousands of earmark projects to local needs which have been put to good use in accordance with the American idea of representative government. In fact, the practice goes back to the very founding of the country when specific projects were called out in early bills. Increased Functionality – Earmarks create opportunities for individual members to be involved in the legislative process which in turn could reveal unexpected common ground in an increasingly divided institution. The decade-long moratorium has drastically diminished member and staff experience and familiarity with earmarks. A BPC assessment shows that only about 30% of members of the current House of Representatives and just 42% of the Senate served in Congress prior to the 2011 ban. With each new Congress, the universe of members and staff with real-world earmark experience grows smaller. A common myth about earmarks is that they are a form of runaway government spending contributing to growing deficits. This argument is both outsized and inaccurate, considering the enormous scope and scale of the total federal budget. Even at the height of their usage, earmarks constituted only about 1% of discretionary spending, or about 1% of one-third of the total federal budget. In other words, if the entire federal budget pot was made up of 300 pennies, only one penny of said pot was set aside for member directed projects or earmarks. It should also be noted that this one penny would be further divided among the 541 members of Congress1. Restoring earmarks does not mean there will be increases in federal spending.

    "content": "Congress introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, the text for President Joe Biden’s proposed immigration reform legislation, on February 18, 2021. Introduced simultaneously in both the House and Senate, these bills are the most comprehensive immigration reforms attempted in the United States since the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (the “Gang of Eight” bill). New and updated provisions in the bill would significantly affect high-skilled legal immigration of foreign workers, a necessary step forward in reforming our legal immigration system. While we wait to see how this legislation progresses, this explainer highlights some of the bill’s proposals for high-skilled legal immigration and identifies additional areas in need of reform. The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 targets improvements in the U.S. employment-based high-skill immigrant visa system, mainly by exempting certain groups from annual caps, adding back unused visas from past years, and increasing some categories. For example, the bill seeks to exempt foreign doctoral students who graduate from U.S. universities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields from annual numerical limits and extends the “dual intent” 1 provision to international students on F-1 visa at an institution of higher education. Therefore, STEM students under the F-1 visa category could directly apply for permanent residency upon graduation and, at least for doctoral students, would not be subject to immigrant visa caps. To assess barriers to accessing U.S. employment opportunities, a provision in the bill directs multiple agencies to conduct an analysis on recent employment history of immigrants and refugees who obtained academic degrees and professional credentials abroad. This assessment will help develop policy recommendations that may help immigrants and refugees obtain skill-appropriate employment opportunities in the United States. The bill increases immigrant visas in the employment-based third preference category from 10,000 to 40,000 for “other workers” who do not fall into the skilled or professional workers classification, while providing employment authorization for spouses and working-age children of foreign workers on H-1B non-immigrant temporary visas. Children of H-1B workers are also protected from “aging out” if the child accompanies the primary visa holder and acquires their nonimmigrant status before turning 18 and are awaiting green cards. Presently, no such policy exists to prevent dependents of H-1B workers, and children are at the risk of losing eligibility for permanent residency at 21 years old if their H-1B primary visa holder parent is unable to acquire a green card in time due to backlogs. These dependents, some of whom immigrated to the United States as kids, are required to convert to another immigration status, leave the country, or remain undocumented; they would have to qualify for a green card on their own in the future. The bill introduces provisions to reduce the backlogs in our current immigration system by eliminating per-country caps for employment-based visas and exempting spouses and children from counting toward the overall employment-based visa caps. Further, anyone who has been waiting for a green card for more than 10 years would be eligible to immediately apply&hellip;",

    "content": "Last week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, indicated their intent to revive earmarks. We believe this can be done in a bipartisan and bicameral way. Many people may have ‘heard’ about earmarks or member directed projects, but for most they are still a mystery, even to members of Congress and staff. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s research shows that most current members of Congress do not have first-hand experience with the practice because it has been shunned for the last decade. Regular turnover of members and staff during that time, combined with an outsized narrative of corruption and deficit inflation, may have left Capitol Hill with an incomplete and misleading view of congressionally directed spending. Contrary to the current zeitgeist, earmarks can help catalyze Congress’ lawmaking process, which has, perhaps not entirely coincidentally, stagnated in the same period since earmarks disappeared. Many do not realize earmarks already underwent important reforms to reduce concerns about corruption, and members of both parties actively sought them for the benefit of their constituents, in accordance with Congress’ constitutionally specified responsibilities. Read our follow-up blog on reforming earmarks While there are minor differences between the House and Senate on this subject, the Congressional Research Service explains that any discretionary spending from Congress, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit that directly impacts a certain state or congressional district is considered an earmark. Earmarks in the past have been an avenue for members to send discretionary spending directly to their district or state for a specified project, such as funding for infrastructure, community programs, university research, hospitals, and other local initiatives. They are most often identified with federal appropriations but can also be included in authorizing legislation like water infrastructure legislation. Earmarks garnered a negative connotation most especially from several cases of legitimate past abuses and, eventually, their use went out of practice. Critics often cite Jack Abramoff, Duke Cunningham, and the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere&#8221; as examples of abuse. These were, in fact, serious cases while also exceptions and not the rule. There were other substantive complaints about earmarks. Typical concerns involved the transparency of requests as well as their distribution. They were periodically hard to distinguish in legislative language. It was common to vaguely mention an earmark in a bill without knowing much about who requested it or its location. Also, there were occurrences when an earmark would be added late in the process with little time for adequate consideration. One other common complaint was that earmarks tended to be disproportionally awarded to appropriations committee members and leadership more than other rank-and-file members. To bring accountability to member directed spending, reforms were put in place in 2007 through new statutory rules enacted by both chambers. These provisions included requirements for members to disclose publicly their requested earmark, to certify that a member or spouse did not have a financial interest, and to identify them clearly in legislative text from the start. Despite these reforms,&hellip;",

    "content": "COVID-19 has damaged many Americans’ personal finances—especially those of women, people with low incomes, people without college degrees, and workers of color. But the impact was so severe in part because too many households are chronically short of savings that could protect them against unexpected losses of income or surprise expenses. These are among the findings from a new Morning Consult survey commissioned by BPC—conducted in partnership with Funding Our Future and Edelman Financial Engines—for America Saves Week, an annual week-long effort focused on helping Americans save more and highlighting how employers and policymakers can facilitate saving. The survey reveals an alarming picture of Americans’ low savings, inadequate access to savings vehicles, wide disparities in savings and account access, and a broad desire for tools that could help build savings to protect them when the next crisis—whether national or personal—hits. This evidence further underscores the urgent need for policymakers and corporate leaders to implement solutions that can make workers more financially secure. Thanks to the massive federal response to the health and economic crisis, overall incomes and savings for U.S. households have actually increased over the past year. These averages, however, conceal the fact that many Americans have suffered immensely during this time. In general, the same pattern repeats across all questions that asked about personal finances in 2020: Workers who were already more likely to be struggling fared worse. Workers with low incomes, those without college degrees, workers of color, and women (for simplicity, “disadvantaged workers”) were all more likely to report financial distress over the past year. Figure 1 breaks down a summary measure—whether someone’s financial situation has gotten worse over the past 12 months—by demographic. Figure 1: Disadvantaged workers are more likely to say their financial situation has gotten worse Share who report their financial situation is worse than one year ago  BPC’s survey reveals a nation in which a large share of the population is struggling to save money and achieve financial security. People with low incomes, workers without college degrees, and workers of color have more volatile incomes and more tenuous job security. Thus, they are most in need of a buffer of savings. Perversely, however, these Americans’ lower incomes make it especially hard for them to pay their bills, let alone put money aside to save. This combination leaves such workers both particularly exposed to negative shocks and particularly vulnerable when those shocks arrive. For instance, BPC’s survey finds that 43% of adults in households with incomes less than $50,000 a year report having no money set aside for emergencies, compared to only 8% of respondents in households earning more than $100,000. This lack of savings is a lack of protection against the unexpected. If workers lost their source of income, nearly half (44%) of those in houesholds making less than $50,000 per year report that they could pay their bills for approximately one month or less out of their savings on hand. Meanwhile, 59% of Black respondents say they either couldn’t fully pay&hellip;",

    "content": "Every day, parents across the country make important decisions about who is caring for their children—whether they provide care themselves or rely on formal or informal child care arrangements. Child care is personal and varies based on a family’s needs, preferences, and circumstances. Understanding what drives parents’ child care decisions is key to creating a high-quality child care system that aligns with what parents want for their families. BPC and Morning Consult conducted a survey of 1,500 parents of children under age 5 in December 2020 to better understand how parents made decisions about their child care arrangements before the coronavirus pandemic and how they are making child care decisions now. A summary of survey findings—from the rates at which parents are returning to formal child care and important factors in their decision-making processes, to implications of a COVID-19 vaccine on current child care arrangements—are highlighted below. This survey is the fourth in a series designed to inform policy recommendations for how to move toward a child care system that meets parents’ needs. High-quality child care costs more than most families can pay. Affordability was a common theme across previous BPC surveys, so in this survey, parents were asked to identify the maximum amount they can afford to pay for child care. Two-thirds of parents (67%) report the maximum weekly amount they can afford to pay for child care is less than $200 per child, or $10,400 annually—considerably less than the cost of high-quality child care in many states. Among parents who were not paying for child care in January 2020, 83% report the maximum weekly amount they can pay is less than $200 per child, with one-quarter unable to pay anything at all. BPC asked parents to identify their ideal child care arrangement, if both price and accessibility were not factors. For the first time, we have quantitative data on parent preferences which helps us understand if the arrangements parents use align with their preferences. Two-thirds (66%) of families with a single parent or two working parents say they were using their ideal child care arrangement in January 2020. Of these families, 53% were using formal child care, 34% were using parent-provided care, and 10% were using relative care. Whether a family was able to use their ideal arrangement varied slightly by income: 72% of families with an income above $100,000 were using their ideal arrangement, while 64% of families with an income between $50,000 and $100,000 and 63% of families with an income below $50,000 say the same. Households with a single parent or two working parents may have a greater need for formal child care than households in which one parent can stay at home. The survey shows that while many of these parents have resumed using their formal child care providers, some are using parent-provided care—either caring for their child themselves or relying on a partner or spouse. At present, 69% of households with a single parent or two working parents are using the same type&hellip;",

    "content": "Congress is on track to enact what is being advertised as a temporary injection of $1.9 trillion in emergency COVID-19 relief. But what if the package turns out to cost $3.5 trillion? The administration’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) is moving under expedited legislative procedures. President Joe Biden laid out a two-step economic plan shortly after being sworn into office. First, to rescue the country from the depths of the pandemic crisis. Second, to “recover” the economy and build back better than before. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the House-reported bill would increase spending by $1.92 trillion over the next decade and reduce revenues by $33 billion over the same period. This assessment, however, masks what is likely to become the true cost of the legislation over the next decade. In the world of federal budgeting, what really matters is not the one-year cost or savings of enacted legislation, but the multiyear impact of policies on the federal ledger. It is a time-honored, bipartisan practice to diminish the apparent costs of tax cuts or new benefits by “sunsetting” the provisions. However, once these desirable provisions are enacted, Congress rarely takes them away, particularly when the benefits are enjoyed by a large swath of the country or a broad set of business interests. The annual extension of numerous tax expenditures are a case in point, as are the Bush tax cuts (which were mostly made permanent). Many key provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire in the coming years. It is highly unlikely they will all be allowed to lapse. The extension of these popular programs is a major reason federal deficits and debt are expected to grow into the future. As the Urban Institute’s Gene Steuerle has written: “never in our history have so many dead and past office holders had such an impact on the course of the country’s fiscal future.” If past is prologue, several short-term programs in the $1.9 trillion package are likely to be extended at considerable added cost. First, it should be noted that of the $1.9 trillion, CBO projects that approximately two-thirds will be injected into the economy over the next seven months. The other one-third will stretch out over the next nine years—through the end of the decade. Indeed, fully $250 billion will be spent beyond the end of 2022. It may be a stretch to call those funds expended after 2022 urgently needed for the current crisis at hand. Second, many of the major spending and tax provisions sunset at the end of calendar year 2021. Ostensibly this is because the pandemic will have subsided and the rescue will have been completed. However, it is easy to see how many one-time provisions may be extended beyond the end of this year, regardless of the state of the economy. Examples include: Child Tax Credit. The expansion of tax credits (a “child allowance”) to families with children sunsets on December 31, 2021. This one-year provision is estimated&hellip;",

    "content": "From day one, President Biden has made clear that addressing America’s infrastructure challenges will be a high priority for his administration. We fully agree that fixing our ailing infrastructure should be Job One for the 117th Congress, but tackling it will be no small task. The nation faces a $2 trillion infrastructure funding gap over the next 10 years, meaning that planned investments are $2 trillion short of what is needed to maintain, modernize, replace, and upgrade our infrastructure. Improving our systems will need to go beyond a simple financial investment. Preparing our nation’s transportation, water, energy, and broadband networks for the future will require a transformation in how we plan, fund, and build infrastructure across the country. With state and local governments struggling to tackle long-deferred maintenance projects, let alone invest in new infrastructure or harness burgeoning technologies, the scale of this problem can seem insurmountable. Big problems require big ideas. The Bipartisan Policy Center has identified six transformative solutions that, taken together, can address the funding gap and position the United States for the future, while also garnering bipartisan support: Transition to a sustainable dedicated revenue source for transportation. The per-gallon fuel taxes that currently flow into the federal Highway Trust Fund can no longer support the necessary level of investment, due primarily to increasing fuel efficiency and the rising costs of infrastructure construction and maintenance. The HTF requires a new revenue model that can keep up with future funding needs while maintaining the user-pay, user-benefit principle that underlies the Trust Fund concept. The following steps will enable the federal government to successfully transition to this new model: (1) enact one last increase in fuel taxes to address near-term funding needs; (2) strengthen the user-pay, user-benefit model to ensure that costs and benefits are fairly allocated across transportation system users; (3) promote the transition to a vehicle miles traveled fee by mandating more state and regional pilots; and (4) restore congressionally directed spending in a transparent and accountable manner to help make the benefits of federal transportation spending more clear to constituents. This roadmap toward a sustainable future for the HTF is both politically viable and fiscally responsible. Make critical investments to decarbonize infrastructure and promote resiliency. The scientific consensus is that the U.S. must rapidly decarbonize to avoid worse climate-related impacts than those already underway. These efforts can, and must, begin now, with faster deployment of existing low-carbon technologies. For example, the entire U.S. wastewater sector could reduce electricity-related emissions by nearly 40% by upgrading to high efficiency and optimal speed pumps. Federal infrastructure legislation should also help to expedite transitions to new technologies by adopting the permitting and project development reforms, discussed later, and by providing robust federal funding and financing for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, energy-efficient street lighting, and other low-emission technologies and investments across infrastructure sectors. Authorize direct payment bonds to bring new investors to the table. The federal government has several programs designed to provide state and local governments with access to low-cost financing for infrastructure&hellip;",

Following these proposed changes in U.S. state law, we highlight a report to the British Parliament that proposes legislative and policy changes to protect campus free expression. President Struppa Reaffirms Chapman’s Commitment to Democracy President Struppa Issues an Additional Statement Regarding John Eastman Daniele Struppa | Office of the President, Chapman University | January 8 and 9, 2021 Chapman University President Daniele Struppa released two statements in response to calls and a petition for the termination of Professor John Eastman after he spoke at a Trump rally that preceded the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. “The Manual says that if a jury finds a faculty member to be guilty of a felony, or if they are disbarred, THEN the university can dismiss them. The university has no right to substitute itself for these formal bodies. … This is the hard part of being in a democracy. This is the very freedom that we fought to defend as terrorists attacked our Capitol Building. But this challenge is not new. Every time we are assaulted by terrorists, there are those who call for a suspension of the rules, for the elimination of fair process, for faster, quicker, more exemplary actions. I realize that my position has made me very unpopular with many of you. As much as that saddens me, it will not compel me to violate the rules under which the university operates.” Eastman has since retired from his post at Chapman. He has also been relieved of his teaching and public outreach roles at the University of Colorado-Boulder, where he is a visiting scholar this academic year. Impeachment Case Sought Against Student Senator Who Is Defending Thin Blue Line Masks Jackson Walker | College Fix | January 25, 2021 “A petition circulating at the Rochester Institute of Technology calls for the impeachment of a student government representative following his refusal to condemn the Thin Blue Line as ‘overt racism’ …The petition, signed by 21 other members of the student government, calls for the impeachment of Jacob Custer, a student government senator and senior at RIT. …The effort to impeach Custer stems in part from conversations through the student government’s group message app where representatives discussed filing a bias report over a campus safety officer who wore a Thin Blue Line face mask.” Custer argued that an effort to prohibit the wearing of such a mask would be censorship.

    "content": "Recent data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection showed another increase in encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border, to around 76,000 in January 2021. Following a few months of increases, traditional and online media are having an argument over whether to say there is a border crisis or if one is coming. This debate over “the right narrative” is beside the point. The real question we should be asking is: “What is the Biden administration doing now to manage and prepare for whatever migration changes might happen in the future?” First, let’s look at the numbers. At the outset we should state that since 2009, overall numbers of apprehended arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have been below the historic peaks seen in the 1980s and 1990s. Since 2009, apprehensions have varied between 300,000 and 550,000 per year. During the 1980s and 1990s these numbers reached highs of more than 1.5 million. However, what has been happening more recently at the border remains notable and necessitates a different approach to border enforcement. As BPC has documented,1 over the last several years we have seen very large shifts in who is arriving at the border and what they are trying to do. As shown in Figure 1, beginning in 2014, we saw the shift from single adults—overwhelmingly Mexican—who were trying to evade the Border Patrol and primarily looking for work in the United States, to the arrival of unaccompanied Central American children seeking asylum who were not trying to evade apprehension. This was followed by the significant increase in Central American families seeking asylum, still mostly turning themselves in. By 2019, these family units made up the majority of encounters at the border. After the Trump administration put in place its series of programs, policies, and new orders—the Title 42 CDC expulsion order in particular—throughout 2020, the makeup of encounters shifted again. In recent months, the border saw fewer unaccompanied children and families arriving, while the number of Mexican single adults increased. However, CBP data from January has shown that more families and unaccompanied children have started arriving at the border in the last month. For example, 4,494 families were encountered at the border in December 2020. That number jumped to 7,260 in January 2021. Single adult encounters also increased from December to January, but marginally, from 61,698 to 62,231. Beginning in March FY2020, USBP and OFO Encounter statistics include both Title 8 Apprehensions, Title 8 Inadmissibles, and Title 42 Expulsions. Source: CBP (1)(2)  The continued increase in single adults is the driving factor in recent increases in encounters. We have reported that this appears to be in some part due to the effect that the Title 42 order has had. Instead of being admitted and processed for immigration removal, which has immigration consequences and may include detention, most adult Mexicans are being repatriated to Mexico under this order. These repatriations often occur within hours of being encountered, without any immigration processing at all. This allows for repeated attempts to enter within a short&hellip;",

    "content": "In December, Congress passed its latest COVID-19 relief legislation and a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending package. Tucked into the 5,593-page legislation were several overdue reforms to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). These changes will make it easier for students and families to access federal student aid to pay for college. The FAFSA is a form administered by the Department of Education that collects information—such as sources of income, assets, family size, and the number of college-enrolled family members—to determine eligibility for federal student aid based on established formulas. To receive aid, students must complete a FAFSA for every year they are enrolled, amounting to about 20 million students filing a FAFSA annually. Filing the FAFSA is critical to ensuring access and affordability for low- and middle-income students. Those who file a FAFSA are 72% more likely to continue progress toward a degree than similar students who do not file. Among low-income students, the effect is even more stark—those who file a FAFSA are more than twice as likely to persist in their education as non-filers. Despite the FAFSA’s importance, the filing process can be confusing and time-consuming, which deters some students from completing the form. Students in lower-income school districts—who stand to benefit most from federal student aid—complete the FAFSA at a rate 7 percentage points lower than students from higher-income districts. Low-income students are also disproportionately selected for FAFSA verification, an exercise similar to a tax audit that requires the submission of additional financial documentation. This extra hurdle in the FAFSA process further limits access to federal aid. While the 2019 FUTURE Act will reduce some of the burdens associated with filing and verification by expanding data sharing between the Internal Revenue Service and Education Department, December’s omnibus bill implemented even more sweeping reforms. The new law reduces the number of questions on the FAFSA—from 108 to just 36—which will streamline the process for many students applying for financial aid. Also included in the legislation is a small, but meaningful change in nomenclature. Previously, the information collected on the FAFSA would be used to generate an “Expected Family Contribution” (EFC) for every student. This term is confusing, as EFC is a measure of financial strength and not necessarily indicative of what a family would be expected to pay for college. Beginning with the 2022-23 application season, the term “student aid index” will replace EFC. Finally, the legislation made significant reforms to the EFC formula to expand eligibility for Pell grants, the federal government’s largest source of need-based aid. Whereas Pell eligibility used to be entirely determined by a student’s EFC, students will now automatically qualify for the maximum Pell award if their income is below 175% of the federal poverty level (or below 225% for students who are single parents). Expanding Pell and changing the terminology for EFC were endorsed by BPC’s Task Force on Higher Education Financing and Student Outcomes. More can be done, however, to improve access to federal student aid. For example, the&hellip;",

    "content": "The independent and bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance Commission in February 2021 voted to adopt a new set of voting equipment standards. These guidelines were years—if not decades—in the making. Despite the long and rocky path to adoption, the new standards are a welcome improvement to federal standards and incorporate the needs of multiple constituencies. Voting systems are the foundation of our voting process, and voter preference and security expectations have changed dramatically over the past two decades. These standards update requirements for cybersecurity, accessibility, and usability that will improve the voting experience. Here’s how. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires standardized, federal guidelines for voting systems used in federal elections. The first set of Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, ‘VVSG 1.0,’ were adopted by the EAC in 2005. The guidelines were intended to update and enhance existing voting systems by increasing security requirements, ensuring functionality, and expanding access for individuals living with disabilities—in line with the new federal election law. The VVSG is the federal government’s way to express its preferences for voting system technology. While voluntary, 38 states and DC embed the EAC’s guidelines into state statutes. The market for voting systems is incredibly small, “characterized by a consolidated, highly concentrated market dominated by a few major vendors.” Manufacturers cannot produce hardware designed for 50 completely different sets of requirements. That’s why manufacturers look to the VVSG as the baseline when creating voting systems. The VVSG is intended to keep U.S. voting systems up to date with modern technology. Bureaucratic red tape and an under-resourced EAC have hindered that expectation. Aside from a few minor, clarifying changes made to the VVSG in 2015, the guidelines had not been fully updated since they were first adopted in 2005. The adoption of ‘VVSG 2.0’ this year must bridge a 15-year technology gap. One aspect of the VVSG has become a recent source of controversy: whether disabled wireless hardware should be allowed to remain in voting systems. VVSG 1.0 allowed wireless connections in voting technology. In response to concerns from cybersecurity experts that wireless connections make a machine vulnerable to interference, the EAC added a provision in VVSG 2.0 that prohibits voting systems from establishing wireless connections. The debate now is not whether wireless connections should be allowed, but how specifically they should be prevented. VVSG 2.0 allows wireless hardware to remain in the voting system, so long as it is disabled. After the EAC clarified this rule on January 29, industry activists sounded the alarm. They argued that leaving any wireless hardware—that is, any physical piece of technology that enables a device to connect to the internet—in the machine opens it up to malicious actors. On the surface, this reasoning makes sense. If we want to prevent voting systems from making wireless connections, removing any wireless hardware seems like an easy solution – right? Not quite. There is limited yearly demand for new voting hardware and only a handful of vendors dominating the market. This means that competition and technological&hellip;",

    "content": "Following the 2020 election, a procedure known as budget reconciliation has gained increasing attention as a possible avenue for President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to enact a policy agenda despite narrow majorities in the House and Senate. Far from the textbook legislative process most people have learned, reconciliation can seem like a maze of steps and restrictions. Here we answer six questions about the procedure and how it might impact the 117th Congress. Reconciliation is a process integral to Congress adopting a budget blueprint known as a concurrent budget resolution. It is important to first understand the budget, authorization and appropriations processes, and their differences. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the statute that guides the congressional budget process, outlines the steps necessary for Congress to adopt an annual budget. The budget is considered in the form of a concurrent resolution and is not signed by the president, so it does not have the force of law. Rather, the budget is a blueprint that sets overall spending and revenue targets for Congress across all federal government functions. The authorization process then separately determines how much money will be authorized to be spent (annually or permanently), and the appropriations process follows with actual funding for the authorized programs. Separately the tax writing committees determine the amount of revenues to be raised and from what sources. Reconciliation is a tool that can be used to achieve the aggregate spending and revenue goals established in an adopted budget resolution. The first step for budget reconciliation to occur is the adoption of a concurrent budget resolution. In the resolution, Congress may include reconciliation “instructions,” which direct a committee or committees of jurisdiction to report specific changes in law to achieve the levels of spending, revenue, deficits, and debt outlined in the resolution. The second step has the instructed committees report their legislative language to their respective budget committees, which combines all the committee’s language into one consolidated bill in each chamber. The House and the Senate must agree to one uniform bill for it to pass, and it can then be signed or vetoed by the president. Reconciliation bills differ from the normal legislative process in that it provides Congress with authority to make significant changes in law through a relatively fast-track procedure that is not available for most legislation. Budget reconciliation legislation is considered under similar procedures as the budget resolution: simple majority adoption with limited time for debate and a restrictive amendment process. Perhaps most importantly, this means that, in the Senate, the bill cannot be blocked by a filibuster. While reconciliation provides fast-track procedures that can help avoid procedural hurdles that might otherwise stall legislation, it is not a blank check. There are limits on how it can be used. The Budget Act places various limitations on the reconciliation process. Reconciliation can address the statutory debt limit, taxes and revenues, and direct or mandatory spending, like Medicare or Medicaid, but not Social Security. Authorized discretionary spending subject to later congressional&hellip;",

Charged with crafting the president’s budget and overseeing agency policy implementation, OMB plays a critical role in federal fiscal policy. Moreover, Ms. Tanden will assume her position at a time when the United States faces both an unprecedented economic downturn and significant fiscal policy challenges. With COVID-19 still rampant across the country, American families and businesses need additional financial relief in order to keep their finances afloat. Key emergency fiscal measures—including expanded unemployment insurance—are scheduled to begin lapsing in March. As long as the pandemic rages, the government needs to continue providing fiscal support. At the same time, once COVID-19 begins to recede, it will be important to calibrate fiscal policy toward stimulus measures that support small businesses reopening and unemployed individuals returning to work. Lastly, while deficit spending has been a necessary response to this unprecedented crisis, it has substantially worsened the United States’ already unsustainable budget outlook. In fiscal year2020 alone, the federal government ran an estimated deficit of $3.1 trillion, or 15% of gross domestic product. This sudden spike dramatically accelerated the growth of debt held by the public, which the Congressional Budget Office now projects will exceed GDP this year, a full decade earlier than its previous projection of 2031. Determining when and how to begin addressing the United States’ fiscal imbalance will be a key challenge facing Ms. Tanden and the Biden administration.

    "content": "The child care workforce plays a critical role in communities by providing foundational education and skills development for children, while supporting working parents. BPC’s recent interviews with child care workers revealed the unique position that child care providers occupy as both small business operators and as an essential social service. A national overview of the child care workforce provides a snapshot to understand the characteristics of this important sector, and lays the groundwork for policies that target opportunities to retain, develop, and recruit child care workers. In 2019, more than 2 million child care workers, nearly all women, were employed in child care programs across the country, with a median hourly pay of $11.65 an hour, or $24,230 a year—well below the federal poverty rate for a family of four, which was $26,200 in 2020. These workers were evenly split between center-based and home-based programs, with about 1 million working in 130,000 center-based child care programs serving almost 7 million children, and another 1 million working in home-based settings serving about 3 million children. This workforce is more diverse than the country’s overall population. More than a quarter (27%) of the center-based early childhood workforce speak a language other than English at home, compared to 14% of the U.S. adult population. Within the child care workforce, teacher aides and assistants are more likely to speak a language other than English (32%) in comparison to lead teachers at 25%. Almost one in five workers in the early childhood field identify as immigrants (18%), roughly similar to the U.S. adult population as a whole (16%), though much higher in comparison to the total K-12 teaching workforce (8%). Though a plurality of the early childhood workforce is white (56%), individuals working in the field are more diverse than the overall population, which is 76% white. About 15% of the early childhood workforce is Black (compared to 13% of the population), and fewer than one in ten are Hispanic (7%, compared to 13% of the total population). This trend holds true in both center- and home-based child care workers, with the latter being 16% Black, 16% Hispanic, and 63% white. Teachers&#8217; aides are more likely to be minorities (33% Black, 42% Hispanic, and 32% white). The child care workforce is also more diverse than K-12 educators, 82% of whom are white. The median pay of a child care worker was $24,230 per year, or $11.65 per hour, in 2019. This income is below the federal poverty rate for a family of four, which was $25,750 in 2019, leading to more than half (53%) of child care workers being enrolled in at least one main public benefit program—Medicaid, CHIP, EITC, SNAP, or TANF—compared to 21% of the U.S. population, despite 60% of the child care workforce working full time. Child care workers who work with infants and toddlers, are minorities, or have a lower educational attainment, receive even lower wages on average.

    "content": "Child care is necessary for working parents with young children. However, families frequently struggle with the high cost of care that in turn impacts their ability to find and keep stable employment and to provide for their family and the healthy development of their children. As such, every dollar a parent receives, through earned income, child care subsidies, tax credits, or other benefits, is critical. Advocates for families and children often focus on improving and increasing direct assistance programs as a way to help working parents access and afford child care, such as the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and Head Start. However, this ignores another significant policy option available to support families with young children – the tax system. The tax code includes a variety of policies that encourage work, benefit families with children, and offset the cost of child care, all providing clear immediate and long-term benefits. Children under age six have the highest poverty rates among any demographic nationally, and financial instability during early childhood can have significant, long-lasting consequences. A growing consensus of neuroscience and developmental research demonstrates the critical importance of a child’s earliest years, meaning there is high potential for the conditions of poverty to “compromise children’s life achievement and employment opportunities” by failing to foster their cognitive, social, and emotional development. While many federal programs with direct spending exist to support the wellbeing of families with children, the tax code includes two provisions that specifically help working parents pay for their child care expenses: the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) and an exclusion for employer-provided child and dependent care assistance (often called Dependent Care Assistance Plans, or DCAP). Two additional tax credits—the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit—are important components of the tax code for many low-income workers, designed to subsidize their income and foster financial stability. Because helping parents afford the high costs of child care is such a critical component of their path to financial stability, this brief focuses on those elements of the tax code that specifically offset the high costs of care. Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. The CDCTC allows eligible taxpayers to offset a portion of their out-of-pocket child and dependent care expenses necessary for them to stay employed. Specifically, taxpayers may claim: (1) up to $3,000 of expenses to acquire care for one qualifying dependent, defined as a child under 13 or an individual incapable of caring for him or herself, or (2) up to $6,000 for two or more dependents. The credit rate varies based on one’s Adjusted Gross Income (gross income minus adjustments) and is calculated by multiplying the amount of qualifying expenses (up to the maximum credit amount) by the appropriate credit rate based on one’s income. The maximum rate is 35% for taxpayers with an AGI of $15,000 or less, and gradually declines to a rate of 20% for taxpayers with an AGI above $43,000.1 The aggregate data on recipients of the CDCTC illuminates several realities. First, even though the credit rate is more generous toward lower-income taxpayers, many low-income families do not receive the credit because the CDCTC is not&hellip;",

    "content": "Tucked into the 2020 year-end COVID-relief and spending package was a five-year extension of a business tax credit aimed at increasing access to paid family and medical leave to low-wage workers who are less likely to have employer provided benefits. With this extension there is an opportunity for the new Administration to promote businesses that utilize this tax credit and expand access to paid leave. Lawmakers should also use this time to examine the success of this policy by authorizing an in-depth examination of its impact. Originally proposed by U.S. Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Angus King (I-ME) and Representatives Mike Kelly (R-PA) and Terri Sewell (D-AL) as the Strong Families Act, the tax credit was enacted as a two-year pilot in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). The tax credit is available for businesses of all sizes that provide their employees with paid parental, family caregiving, and personal medical leave. To qualify, employers must provide at least two weeks of paid leave that compensates their employees with at least 50% of their regular earnings. The size of the tax credit depends on the generosity of the paid leave benefits, ranging from 12.5% of the cost of paid leave that replaces 50% of earnings to 25% of the cost of paid leave benefits replacing 100% of earnings. The credit is only available for leave taken by workers who have been employed for at least one year and who make less than $78,000 annually. At the end of 2019, the tax credit was extended for one additional year. Because the credit was launched as a short-term pilot program, there has been considerable uncertainty about its future, potentially discouraging businesses from using it. Businesses that are uncertain about the tax credit’s future would be less likely to introduce or expand benefits if they believe workers may soon lose them. Now that the program has now been extended for 5 years, through the end of 2025, employers can more confidently plan to utilize the credit to help provide paid family and medical leave. With the provision now in place for 5 years, the Biden Administration has a real opportunity to promote the tax credit and study its effectiveness in helping employers provide paid leave benefits. Specifically, the Departments of Treasury and Labor, in partnership with the Small Business Administration, should market the program and disseminate educational materials to companies, small business owners, and workers. The Administration should help employers understand which employees are eligible for coverage and how to request reimbursement from the IRS. It is also important that the federal government takes the next 5 years to study the impact of the tax credit. We recommend that lawmakers authorize and appropriate funding for the Government Accountability Office to conduct an independent, in-depth study of the efficacy of this tax credit. In addition, the Department of Treasury should collect information and report annually on the take up and impact of the program. These studies would enable lawmakers and analysts to&hellip;",

    "content": "The CARES Act provided $3.5 billion in supplemental child care funding through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) to help address the needs of working families and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. States were given broad flexibility for how to use this funding, and therefore took a variety of approaches to spend these funds. However, by September, many states ran out of the supplemental funding and began pulling from other funding sources to continue supporting providers. By the end of 2020, just 13 states had announced plans to provide continued support for providers into the new year, given most states had already expended their supplemental CCDBG funds and the uncertainty about further federal relief through the end of the year. This 50-state analysis identifies how each state supported child care providers and working parents during 2020, including a specific update to our prior analysis in September. In December, Congress came to agreement on another major COVID relief and recovery package which provided $10 billion in emergency assistance for child care through CCDBG and requires states to publish how they plan to use such funds by late February. The Bipartisan Policy Center will track how states are using this new infusion of federal funding to support child care providers and working parents. Grants: At some point before September, 49 states had used CARES Act funds to offer grants to child care providers, and between October through December, 23 states announced new grants for child care providers. Subsidy: By September, 17 states that paid subsidies to providers based on pre-pandemic enrollment over the summer reverted to payments based on attendance. From October to December, five more states reverted to attendance-based subsidy payments, while 13 explicitly announced that they would continue to pay providers based on enrollment. School-Age Care: By September, seven states had offered financial assistance for school-age child care that went beyond typical subsidy support and most often took the form of grants to providers serving children of school ages. Six additional states began offering this type of assistance between October and December. Non-CCDBG Funds: While 21 states had dedicated additional non-CCDBG funds by September to offer support for child care providers, 14 states did so from October through December (10 of which had already done so, and four of which did so for the first time). The non-CCDBG funds allocated between October through December totaled $446 million—of which $394 million came from 12 states’ Coronavirus Relief Fund federal dollars. 2021 plans: By the end of 2020, just 13 states had announced plans to provide continued support for providers into the new year, given most states had already expended their supplemental CCDBG funds, and the uncertainty about further federal relief through the end of the year. However, late in December, Congress came to agreement on another COVID relief and recovery package which provided $10 billion in emergency assistance for child care through CCDBG and requires states to publish how they plan to use such funds by late February.

    "content": "As Congress prepares for a robust legislative schedule in the first 100 days of President Biden’s tenure, members of Congress and the administration must consider the invaluable role of the child care sector, which ensures our nation’s workforce and economy can thrive. Parents and child care businesses are still in the throes of the pandemic and it is imperative that Congress implement a comprehensive, two-fold response: address the continued, immediate need for an additional $22 billion in short-term relief; and take action to lay a strong, sustainable foundation so that the child care industry can make a successful recovery. Our country continues to experience the pandemic’s devastation of an already fragile child care industry. While the $10 billion provided in the December funding package was sorely needed, it was intended as a down payment to sustain the sector for three months. Unfortunately, this down payment does not make any specific investments in the needs of parents who will rely on child care to return to work in the coming months. Therefore, Congress should pass legislation with an additional $22 billion for child care through CCDBG: $16 billion in emergency relief funding for the child care industry and $5.9 billion to support working parents. In addition to providing short-term relief, Congress should work to remedy the pre-existing challenges that the child care sector faced before pandemic. Unfortunately, the gap in affordable, accessible child care is not new. In addition to the shortage of child care slots, child care providers operate their businesses on slim margins and struggle to pay their workforce much more than minimum wage. Parents, unable to afford to spend more than $200 per week on child care, cannot make up this difference in providers’ budgets. The child care sector primarily relies on the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) which is divided into two funding streams: discretionary funding under CCDBG and mandatory funding under the Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES). To better support the sustained success of parents, children, and the sector, it is imperative that Congress bolster both funding mechanisms and include an additional annual increase of at least $3 billion to CCES. By leveraging bipartisan energy to establish longer-term systemic fixes to support both parents and providers, Congress can re-establish the sector and build child care back on a better foundation than before the pandemic by taking the actions outlined below.",

At the same time, new business applications soared during the second half of 2020, fueling expectations of a strong recovery. These juxtaposed trends—lost revenue and employment among existing small businesses and apparently high rates of entry from new businesses—pose a challenge for government policy.

    "content": "For the last 50 years, the “protein folding problem” has puzzled researchers seeking to untangle the mysteries of human biology. Proteins play a critical role in determining how cells function in the body, which impacts everything from growth to development to the regulation of the body’s tissues and organs. Each protein’s specific function is dependent on its three-dimensional, ribbon-like structure, which is complex because it folds itself up with an astronomical number of possible configurations. A researcher in 1969 estimated it would take longer than the entire known universe to discover all the combinations. The current process of predicting protein structures uses trial and error, often taking years and requiring expensive, specialist equipment to ascertain the shape of a protein. Recent advancements in solving the protein folding problem are a salient example of why investing in AI research and development is so critically important. In December, the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) announced that DeepMind’s AlphaFold had used artificial intelligence to make major strides in accurately predicting protein structures in a matter of days. AlphaFold was trained using deep learning techniques on 170,000 known protein sequences and structures, available from a public protein data bank. According to DeepMind’s press release, this enabled the algorithm to translate the structures into data and use that data to model target protein shapes and predict how accurate they were. DeepMind stated how this “demonstrates the impact AI can have on scientific discovery and its potential to dramatically accelerate progress in some of the most fundamental fields that explain and shape our world.” There is reason to be cautious, as the DeepMind researchers are yet to submit a peer-reviewed paper, which is key to ensuring validity and giving the findings external credibility. Further, the limitations of the technology are still unclear and the protein folding problem is only one part of the process. For example, while this method could accelerate vaccine development, large clinical trials that prove its efficacy will still take time. Going forward, the scientists will need to collaborate with other multi-disciplinary researchers on how to use this technology to develop new medicines, or where it could be useful in other fields. If these claims prove to be true, however, this is a significant step in understanding the mysteries of the human body. The technology has the potential to accelerate drug and vaccine development, which could help mitigate against future pandemics, aid researchers to better understand diseases, and, according to the DeepMind team, even assist in environmental sustainability solutions. DeepMind’s breakthrough appears to be the latest example of AI as a meta technology. Meta technologies are technologies or inventions that have the capacity to aid new discoveries or spur innovation in other areas. Just as the microscope created a medium to study objects too small for the naked eye, and the telescope provided a way to detect objects too distant, AI can help find patterns that aid discoveries in virtually every discipline. This highlights both the potential of AI and the importance of investing in research and development.&hellip;",

    "content": "One of the many ways policymakers expanded unemployment insurance (UI) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was to provide additional funding for Short-Time Compensation (STC) programs. STC—also known as work share—allows employees experiencing reduced hours to collect unemployment benefits to replace a portion of their lost wages. This potentially averts layoffs by financially supporting employees in situations when their employer is only partially able to retain them on payroll. As the economy continues to struggle, the Biden administration is promoting STC as an avenue to keep workers connected to their employers. STC provides employees whose hours have been cut with a prorated portion of UI benefits. For an employee to be eligible for STC, their employer must elect to participate in the program by submitting to the state workforce agency a written plan that specifies the percentage reduction in the hours for affected employees. Employers must maintain health and retirement benefits for employees receiving STC. While those on the program are not required to meet any work search requirements, they must be available for their normal workweek. Participating workers may also enroll in workforce development programs to enhance their skills while their hours have been reduced. Like regular UI, states design their own STC programs, which are administered by the state workforce agency and funded by state UI payroll taxes on firms. As such, STC eligibility, work hour requirements, and weeks of available benefits vary considerably across the 25 states with operational programs. For example, Texas requires that a reduction in normal weekly hours between 10% to 40% is applied to at least 10% of the employees in an affected unit, whereas New York requires a reduction in normal weekly hours between 20% to 60% applied to at least two employees. Additionally, seasonal, intermittent, and temporary employees can participate in New York’s STC program, but Florida requires participants to be full-time, permanent employees. The CARES Act provided 100% federal financing for 26 weeks of benefits in states with existing STC programs and 50% federal financing to states establishing temporary programs, in addition to allocating $100 million for implementation and administration. This support was originally set to expire at the end of 2020, but the Continued Assistance for Unemployed Workers Act extended the federal financing of STC through March 14, 2021. Several states, including Virginia, Wisconsin, and Ohio, used the funding made available by the CARES Act to create or grow their STC programs, increasing the number of workers and employers using the program. Despite these expansions, only 103,000 of the 18 million workers collecting unemployment benefits are receiving them through a work sharing program. President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan seeks to allocate further federal resources to continue fully funding work share programs through September 2021 and extend the number of weeks a worker can claim STC benefits. Research on existing work sharing programs in Japan and Europe demonstrates that this approach helps stabilize employment during economic downturns. During the Great Recession, Germany’s program preserved an estimated&hellip;",

    "content": "On December 31, 2020, the Trump administration extended the June 2020 proclamation that suspended the entry of certain immigrant and nonimmigrant visa holders1 through March 31, 2021. The administration argued that the U.S. labor market woes from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to pose a threat to the employment of American workers, displacing them from jobs during COVID-19 recovery. Despite these supposed protections, it appears that no more native-born workers have applied for available H-2B visa jobs in the fiscal year 2020, wasting eligible H-2B visas that would have qualified under the 66,000 annual worker cap. The extension of the proclamation, moreover, continued efforts by the outgoing Trump administration to restrict legal immigration, even after he left office on January 20. Although President Joe Biden signed executive orders on his Inauguration Day to overturn other travel bans that affected mostly Muslim and African countries, he has not, as of this date, revoked these other proclamations restricting immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. Research suggests that, even before Trump’s proclamation, the United States was experiencing a decline in legal immigration of foreign-born individuals. Data released by the Department of Homeland Security shows that the number of individuals obtaining legal permanent residency in the United States declined for a third year in 2019, with a 12% drop in those obtaining permanent residency from FY2016 to FY2019. The majority of the decline in 20192 was in the family-sponsored preferences and refugee admissions. Under the Trump administration, legal refugee admissions to the United States also dropped from an already record-low figure of 30,000 in FY2019 to 18,000 in FY2020.3 Actions undertaken by the Trump administration, compounded by the travel restrictions due to the pandemic, resulted in the continuous decline of international undergraduate and graduate students attending U.S. colleges and universities under the student visa program. According to the annual Open Doors Report, international student enrollment to U.S. universities and colleges was on a declining trend even before the pandemic. The report shows that the 2018-2019 school year enrollment rates among international students dropped by 1.8% from the preceding year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, however, international student enrollment has further declined by a staggering 43% for the 2020-2021 academic year. It is yet to be determined whether the decline in international student enrollment will reverse post-pandemic and post-Trump, but whiplash policy changes undertaken by the Trump administration during the pandemic may have exacerbated perceptions of the United States as a less welcoming place for international students and foreign workers. This, along with welcoming policy changes and easier post-graduation labor opportunities in other countries competing for international talent, may have displaced the United States as a top choice for many incoming international students. For example, in 2019, Canada experienced double-digit growth for the second year in a row in international students, trailing only slightly behind the United States and Australia. The repercussions of declining student enrollment rates due to the capricious policy changes undertaken in 2020 in response to the pandemic may not be clear for years&hellip;",

    "content": "New U.S. Customs and Border Protection data released in early January shows that southwest border encounters during the final three months of the Trump administration rose to levels last seen early in fiscal year 2019. Despite the significant decline in apprehensions in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CBP has recorded more encounters during the first three months of FY2021 than in any of the first three months of previous years of the Trump administration. These trends continue to suggest that although the Trump administration made hardline border deterrence efforts a signature of its larger immigration platform, these stringent mechanisms ultimately failed in deterring migrants from trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border from October to December 2020. In addition, with President Joe Biden now in the White House, many migrants are anticipating the new administration will rescind hardline Trump administration border policies, further facilitating the increase in arrivals at the southwest border since October 2020. The new FY2021 data shows that monthly encounters1 at the southwest border have rebounded significantly since the initial decline in early 2020. As shown in Figure 1, the first three months of FY2021 witnessed more encounters at the border than any of the first three months of the four prior fiscal years. CBP (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)   In addition, Title 42 expulsions continue to comprise a majority of CBP enforcement encounters for the first three months of FY2021. As shown in Figure 2, CBP recorded 68,826 encounters in October 2020 which include both Title 8 apprehensions and Title 42 expulsions.2 Of those 68,826 encounters, 62,788 of them were Title 42 expulsions, while only 6,038 were Title 8 apprehensions. By December 2020, monthly encounters had risen to 70,630. The last time monthly encounters reached levels like this was seen in early FY2019 when Central American families began arriving at the southwest border in large numbers. Source: CBP (1)(2)   This trend raises questions as to whether the United States may face another surge of migration at the southwest border during the first few months of President Joe Biden’s first term. Recent reports have documented thousands of hopeful migrants joining Facebook and WhatsApp groups dedicated to organizing northbound caravans, with many migrants exchanging messages specifically encouraging one another to wait until after Biden’s inauguration to travel. While U.S. border officials have stated that they will not allow any northbound caravans to cross, these trends suggest migrants anticipate President Biden’s arrival to the White House may make access easier and are planning accordingly. In terms of demographic groups, the new CBP data also showed that single adults continued to comprise a majority of those apprehended at the border. As shown in Figure 3, of the 68,828 apprehensions in October 2020, 59,516 were single adults. For FY2021 to date, single adults have accounted for approximately 87% of all encounters, reverting to the demographic compositions that were experienced before 2014. In comparison, family units accounted for only 7% of all encounters during the first three months of FY2021, while unaccompanied children&hellip;",

The November 2020 election carried some of that energy with state and local pre-K measures passing in Colorado and Multnomah County, Oregon. While pre-K can have positive lifelong impacts on children, it is a narrow sliver of the whole child care system and not a substitute for other models of care that benefit working parents. The Child Care Crisis Our country is in the middle of a child care crisis that is having negative implications on our children, businesses, and workforce. Across the country, the demand for child care greatly outpaces the supply of child care slots, creating a significant child care gap. Additionally, the cost of owning and operating a child care facility exceeds what families can pay, causing these small businesses to constantly exist on the precipice of closure, a phenomenon accelerated and highlighted by the pandemic. Despite child care facilities doing their best to minimize costs by operating on slim margins, families are paying exorbitant amounts to send their children to child care; the monthly cost of child care is a major expense that can easily rival the monthly cost of housing for families. The ongoing struggle to find affordable and available child care is markedly worse for working parents with infants and toddlers or for parents working non-traditional hours (outside of the typical 9-5 workday). The lack of child care has implications for our workforce and economy, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. With ongoing closures due to the pandemic, over 68% of parents reported that child care has affected their ability to stay in the workforce and 42% of parents have reported changing jobs in order to have more flexible hours to afford child care. How does Pre-K fit in? Pre-K can be both high-quality early education and child care. Pre-K is child care because it provides children with a safe place to go while parents are otherwise engaged. However, pre-K programs are distinct from other child care options because they are primarily implemented by states as a classroom initiative versus work support for working families. Pre-K’s primary mission is kindergarten preparedness and as such, it benefits from a structure largely modeled after a school-day classroom: one that follows a 9-3 schedule. Achievement has long been tied to a child’s experience and development before they reach kindergarten, and the benefits of a high-quality pre-K program have been widely acknowledged: children see higher math and literacy abilities, in addition to social emotional benefits. While the format has the potential to be effective in reaching its intended goals, pre-K is not a productive model for addressing the larger child care crisis facing our nation. By the nature of its structure, pre-K is unable to provide child care for parents who may work non-traditional hours. Single-parent households or households where parents work beyond 3 p.m. will need secondary care arrangements in addition to pre-K. As previously stated, those child care arrangements are already limited in supply. Furthermore, the&hellip;",

    "content": "A narrowly divided Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2021, followed by the Inauguration of President Biden on January 20. With narrow margins in the House of Representative and Senate, our nation’s elected leaders must work together to secure bipartisan solutions to meet our nation’s economic and social needs. Improving child care opportunities for working parents with young children is one area that presents an opportunity and should be a priority for bipartisan agreement and legislation. The prosperity of our American economy is directly impacted by the well-being of the American family. Child care is essential for millions of working parents with young children aged five and under. Child care allows working parents to find and maintain stable employment, and ensures their children are set up for success upon entering school and later in life. As such, families need access to affordable child care that fits their circumstances and needs. It is imperative that we support all families, especially those with infants and toddlers who face greater challenges when it comes to accessing and affording child care. The country faced a child care crisis even before COVID-19 and it has only been exacerbated over the last year. In our 2020 analysis of pre-pandemic supply and potential need for child care across 25 states, we identified a potential gap of almost 32% or over 2.5 million families lacking access to child care. While we know supply doesn’t meet demand, the cost to produce the service still exceeds what most parents can afford to pay, excluding too many from participating in the workforce to provide for their families and leaving children without a safe and developmentally appropriate learning environment. There are not enough financial or policy levers in place to make up for these differences, leaving child care businesses struggling and preventing child care workers from earning stable wages. Together, these issues, present prior to the pandemic, cause significant strain on economic growth and individual opportunity, and COVID-19 has brought these pervasive challenges within the child care market to a head. In our December 2020 parent survey, 11% of parents reported the child care provider they used for their youngest child last January has permanently closed, while just 10% of parents report their provider is open and operating with no restrictions or changes, such as limited hours, spaces, or reserving spots for essential workers. Unfortunately, the link between access to child care and a parent’s workforce participation has never been so evident than during the COVID-19 crisis, as women have left the workforce at unprecedented rates, down to levels not seen since 1988, too often due to a lack of child care. But there are ways forward that can stabilize the supply of child care programs, improve access and affordability, enable child care businesses and workers to prosper, and ensure every child has a bright future. By reaching across the aisle to develop a better child care system that works for all families, Congress can ensure that today’s workforce is strong, tomorrow’s workforce can grow, and our economy can not only recovery from the current pandemic but can prosper in the&hellip;",

    "content": "The 116th session of the United States Congress, convened in January 2019, faced some of the most difficult challenges in recent memory. Despite these challenges, the bipartisan split – Republicans leading the Senate and Democrats leading the House – meant that members had to work across the aisle to reach solutions to the problems facing America’s children and families. Fortunately, child care emerged as one of the areas with the strongest bipartisan support, which led to numerous legislative proposals and increases in appropriations for these critical programs. As the coronavirus pandemic swept the nation in early 2020, much of the focus within Congress shifted towards how to respond to, and recover from, the pandemic. Democrats and Republicans alike recognized the essential nature of child care in recovering from the devastating economic and social impacts the coronavirus had on our country. For more on how leaders worked to sustain the child care industry and support working parents, read our explainer. Below is a list of key proposals to improve child care in our country that garnered bipartisan support in the 116th Congress, as well as a description of the appropriations Congress provided for federal child care programs, including emergency aid to address the COVID-19 crisis. The work of the 116th Congress shows the clear bipartisan support that exists for improving child care programs, policies, and funding levels. As we move into the 117th Congress, members on both sides of the aisle should work together to build on these actions and activities by continuing to prioritize improving child care for working parents, their children, and our economy.",

    "content": "Despite the disruption of COVID-19 on their academic and personal life, college-aged voters turned out in record numbers for the 2020 election. Their commitment to getting out the vote has been called “one of the defining elements of the election.” To analyze students’ commitment to democracy and civil exchange, BPC brought together four student leaders and an expert on campus voting for a panel on student citizenship and student engagement last September. Panelists discussed the challenges faced in promoting civic literacy and increasing voter turnout in their campus communities, and what they anticipated this academic year. BPC caught up with these students to learn how their semester panned out, what they observed, and what’s next. All four noted that students want more opportunities to engage with others from across the political spectrum. Some met this need through events designed to give students techniques for navigating respectful disagreement, while others focused on specific policy issues. Many events were online, but some managed to host physically-distanced, in-person events. While the pandemic has made their mission more difficult, these student leaders have no intention of slowing down. The undergraduates devoted this year to providing peers with the chance to engage with their political opposites—opportunities that are in high demand despite a contentious political climate. At James Madison University, senior Anna Connole was a Democracy Fellow at JMU’s Center for Civic Engagement, helping create resources and host virtual townhalls with local and national political candidates to “bring the current civic landscape directly to students.” Connole recalls one interaction during a voter registration drive with a JMU freshman who was reluctant to share his political opinions. The student responded dismissively to her questions, saying that he doubted she really wanted to hear his thoughts. “This, unfortunately, is not an unfamiliar response,” said Connole. In call-out culture, “students can become immediately closed off because they want to avoid being lectured or guilt tripped.” “The lesson I learn from these interactions is how much young students can assume the worst of people trying to bring up politics—and just how grateful they are to be proven wrong.” Saint Anselm College junior Brendan Flaherty sees a similar need to bring people together and take the heat out of political discussions. “While it seems like people care less and less about the political process and treat it more as an outlet for getting angry at others,” he said, “there are real pockets of students who are willing and ready to restore faith in our systems.” To reach those pockets, Flaherty serves as a Kevin B. Harrington Student Ambassador at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on the Saint Anselm campus, which hosts events ranging from primary debates to book talks to debate watch parties. One of those events was Finding Common Ground, a debate series in which students tackled divisive issues and offered nuanced presentations of two opposing positions and a critique of their own arguments. The inaugural debate focused on defunding the police. Emily Garcia, a junior at Arizona&hellip;",

As climate patterns shift and the impacts of extreme weather events increase, America’s $4.1 trillion worth of transportation infrastructure assets will be subject to stressors that will reduce their reliability and capacity. Transportation is also the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, making both climate change mitigation and adaptation urgent priorities. While the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced some of the stress on our nation’s roads, it has exacerbated other transportation challenges, such as the need to provide transit for essential workers, many of whom rely on it to reach their jobs. As state and local budgets reel from the impacts of COVID-19, it will be even more important for the federal government to promote economic recovery and resilience through smart transportation investments. The Bipartisan Policy Center has led several initiatives to develop and advocate for consensus-driven, cost-effective, and bipartisan infrastructure policies.

    "content": "In December 2020, Congress approved its second largest COVID-19 relief package to address the ongoing economic and societal impacts of the pandemic. The legislation included $10 billion through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) to support the child care needs of working families and stabilize child care providers. Congress recognized the importance of offering this much needed aid through CCDBG, in a flexible manner, much in the way the CARES Act emergency funds were allocated early in 2020. The flexible CCDBG funding included in the CARES Act proved successful over the last nine months, and the continuation of this structure will provide a much-needed lifeline to struggling child care providers and working families, ultimately helping our nation on its path to recovery in 2021. In March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which included $3.5 billion in emergency funding through CCDBG to help states provide child care assistance to frontline workers and to stabilize the child care market. Congress included flexibilities to regular CCDBG requirements to ensure states could distribute funds to families and programs in greatest need in an efficient and effective manner, and to meet the unique circumstances of the pandemic. These provisions are described in greater detail here. The December relief and recovery legislation provided $10 billion through CCDBG to supplement—not supplant—state general revenue funds used to provide child care assistance to low-income working families. While the legislation retained most of the flexibilities within the CARES Act, there were several new provisions that clarified congressional intent for how the supplemental funds could be spent. New language allows states to use the $10 billion in emergency funds to: Support the stability of the child care sector, including by requiring states to widely publicize the availability of funding available for such purposes and provide technical assistance to help providers apply for funding. Implement enrollment and eligibility policies that support fixed costs of providing child care, including by delinking reimbursement rates from child absences or provider closures. Provide families relief from copayments and tuition payments, including by paying these portions directly to child care providers. Cover providers’ fixed costs and increased operating expenses. Provide technical assistance to providers regarding the safe provision of child care services while there is community transition of COVID-19. Additionally, the legislation established reporting requirements for how states spend the $10 billion. The following requirements are associated with the funds provided in December (not the CARES Act funding): States, territories, and tribes receiving funds must submit a report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by February 25, 2021, describing how their funds will be spent, and no later than October 31, 2022, submit a report describing how the funds were spent. The Secretary shall submit to Congress a report summarizing the information submitted above. These reports are due March 27, 2021, and December 21, 2022, respectively. Also, of note, the legislation removed a requirement that accompanied the CARES Act resources, which specified the funds would be available through September 30,&hellip;",

    "content": "The January 6, 2020 assault on the Capitol was one of the gravest in the institution’s history. Not since the War of 1812 has the Capitol Building been overrun and degraded. Threats to Congress are neither new nor are they an artifact of 18th or 19th century America; threats are as enduring as the institution itself. But Congress has always recovered, adapted, and persevered, even when facing the unimaginable. In 1998, a gunman carried out a deadly attack, taking the life of two Capitol Police officers. Just a few years later, the Capitol was a target of the 9/11 hijackers, but fortunately, they were thwarted. Just a month later, two Senate offices were mailed anthrax spores, sickening several Senate staff and killing two postal workers. Three years after that, the office of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist was mailed powdered ricin, a deadly poison. Each of these events, in their own way, shook those who work in Congress. Representative democracy is resilient, but it is meant to be carried out free from threats. When the unthinkable happens, our elected leaders and the staff who support them cannot retreat. Several Bipartisan Policy Center staff served on Capitol Hill during these challenging moments. Here they reflect on their experiences and share what helped them come back and carry out the American people’s business. “The 1998 attack took place in July. That was the first time that I personally experienced that you were not always safe on the Hill like you would have thought, with all the security that I thought existed. Even when you had security at all the doors, you were still at risk of unhinged individuals. It was controlled rather quickly, yet unfortunately still resulted in the death of two officers. The healing part of it came about with the two officers lying in state in the Rotunda.” Bill Hoagland, Director, Senate Budget Committee “I was in the Hart Senate Office Building at the time of the shooting. We heard of an incident happening, but there wasn&#8217;t the same type of communication that there is now. There was a lot of uncertainty. We watched the television to see what was happening 300 yards away in the Capitol Building.” Franz Wuermannsdobler, Legislative Assistant, Senator Robert Byrd “I recall with the shooting we actually had one of our legislative correspondents who happened to be giving a tour in the Capitol very nearby at that point and heard and saw the shots and was obviously very much affected by that. Not only were we working on the Capitol grounds, but then to have someone who was so close to us be so close to what happened and thinking about how it could have gone differently. We could have even lost someone who worked in our very office.” John Richter, Special Assistant and Speechwriter, Senator Olympia Snowe “I had experienced previous periodic evacuations because of suspicious packages and similar false alarms, but I had not felt unsafe until American Airlines flight 77 hit the Pentagon. At that point, following a panicked call from my mother, I gathered up a few things and corralled some younger staff and joined hundreds of our colleagues streaming out of the building.

    "content": "As the COVID-19 pandemic hit our country in early 2020, widespread business closures and stay at home orders intended to prevent community spread of the virus caused massive disruptions to our everyday lives. For many parents with young children, this meant simultaneously working from home while juggling caregiving responsibilities due to child care and school closures. Child care businesses operate in a precarious position in normal times, but these closures, new requirements such as reduced class sizes, and lower attendance rates, all caused a perfect storm that exacerbated the thin margins already permeating the industry. In March, Congress provided initial relief in the CARES Act to help stabilize the industry. However, in August, 70% of parents reported their program was either still closed or operating at reduced capacity or hours, and a striking 14% of centers had permanently closed. Early after the CARES Act passed, it was abundantly clear that the $3.5 billion in the law for the Child Care and Development Block Grant was insufficient for meeting the needs of providers and parents in the ongoing crisis. In May, BPC’s President joined the Early Childhood Initiative’s Director in an op-ed published in Newsweek, describing how child care is an essential workforce. In June, BPC was published in The Hill calling for more funding to stabilize the industry. We interviewed child care providers who discussed their experiences trying to stay open, and held a public event with ten state child care program administrators discussing their use of the CARES Act funds and highlighting the needs that were unmet by the legislation. These messages resonated with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, who worked to ensure more funding would be available to help sustain child care businesses and support families. Unfortunately, after the CARES Act was passed in March, the next relief Congress provided to this critical industry occurred in December. The following is a summary of major legislative action related to coronavirus aid and relief during 2020, beginning with the CARES Act in March through the December 2020 aid package. Despite each of the previous attempts at providing additional support for child care providers and working parents, by September, House and Senate leadership had still failed to reach a compromise on child care, as well as on a broader emergency relief package. A number of bipartisan lawmakers joined together to encourage leadership to reach agreement on such a package. On September 15, the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus released a $1.5 trillion framework representing a middle road between the HEROES Act and HEALS Act. The “March to Common Ground” proposal included $15 billion for child care, closely aligned with the $10 billion in stabilization funding and $5 billion for CCDBG included in the Senate HEALS package. In December, a bipartisan, bicameral group of members released a proposal intended to spur conversations with the hopes of reaching a deal by the end of the year. The proposal, led by Sens. Manchin (D-WV) and Romney (R-UT), included $10 billion&hellip;",

Mayorkas is no stranger to this process; he was previously confirmed by the Senate to be director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and later deputy secretary of DHS under the Obama administration. But the decimation of the department under the Trump administration, which has had six heads in the last four years, only two of whom were Senate-confirmed, and two of which were ruled by federal courts to have been illegally named to their “acting” positions. Not to mention the acting heads of most of the major operational entities at the department, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which never had a Senate-confirmed director, and Customs and Border Protection, which has had an acting commissioner for a year and a half. Further, the extensive changes to immigration policy, process, and operations at the border under the Trump administration will represent a significant undertaking to review and determine what to keep and what to unwind. All of these issues make this possibly the most significant confirmation of a Homeland Security secretary since Tom Ridge was named in 2003. While Mayorkas comes to the job with the most experience and understanding of the department and its issues of any previous nominee, Senators would be right to ask some serious questions about what he will do with what he is inheriting. Among the most pressing: These are just the big areas that will need to be covered in this hearing. Mayorkas’ answers will give great insight into how the Biden administration intends to differentiate its DHS from that under Trump. Hopefully, Mayorkas is up to the task.",

    "content": "During the fall of 2020, with the support of The Rockefeller Foundation, the Bipartisan Policy Center convened a series of unusual discussions. Unusual, at least, compared to typical Washington think tank fare. Bringing together a variety of voices to generate ideas for addressing the massive challenges facing the country, the forum was a cross between TED Talks and Shark Tank. Pithy, idea-focused presentations followed by rigorous questioning and robust exchanges. Participants were asked to address difficult issues: racial equity, workforce challenges, measurement shortcomings. While our goal was creativity, what really struck us was the pragmatic nature of the ideas proposed—and the inherent optimism embedded within that pragmatism. Those ideas have been summarized and collected in a new report released today, Moving Americans Ahead: Bold Ideas for Shared Economic Recovery and Security. Some of the ideas are starting points for further discussion; others are small steps that would catalyze policy development. Together, the presentations and discussions reflected in this document indicate that the enormity of our present challenges must not discourage us. In the report’s foreword, Paul Romer asks, “Are we still capable of using evidence to come to a consensus about how to lay the foundation for a better future?” The TED-Shark process and results reaffirmed our confidence that the answer is a resounding “Yes.” Our challenges are tractable and addressable. The right structures for idea generation and discussion can help develop solutions that have bipartisan support. The issues discussed during these events appear to us to be promising areas of bipartisan progress. The COVID-19 economic crisis forced tens of millions of Americans into unemployment. Whether permanent or temporary, it was a new experience for most. Many now recognize the need for modernization and reform across our public safety net. In a survey conducted last summer for Rockefeller and BPC, both Democratic and Republican respondents expressed high levels of support for unemployment insurance modernization. The ability to smoothly navigate a bureaucracy and access benefits is not a left or right issue. Nobody enjoys filing for unemployment benefits but, if forced to do it, anyone would prefer a process that is as efficient as possible. Event participants pointed out that constant shifts in the workforce, particularly among contingent and domestic workers, underscore the need for reform. For the foreseeable future, it seems likely that public support will still be needed for workers displaced through no fault of their own. Over the longer term, there is bipartisan interest in UI reforms that ensure the system efficiently serves its intended purpose. Unquestionably, the challenge of eliminating racial inequities has multiple dimensions that cannot always be addressed together. We have been encouraged in recent months by bipartisan interest in stronger support for early childhood programs and higher education that would help address persistent social and economic inequities. Yet the challenge of racial inequity is daunting. It is widely recognized that the pandemic and resulting economic crisis had a disproportionate impact on Americans of color.

    "content": "As COVID-19 exposed the fragility of the child care market, with thousands of child care programs being permanently closed and driving many more to the brink of financial collapse, the pandemic also put a spotlight on policies necessary to stabilize child care businesses. Targeting child care subsidy payment rates and practices for the hours of care provided to children whose families receive subsidies can have an immediate and positive impact on the overall child care market. BPC offers two briefs that look at child care subsidy payment policies implemented by states that support stabilization of child care—increasing the rates paid for child care subsidy, and the use of grants and contracts as a method to provide payment for child care slots. Although COVID-19 brought awareness of the child care market’s volatility, the child care business model in this country was broken long before the pandemic. Simply put, the cost to deliver a quality child care setting is more than most parents can afford to pay. The stability of the child care market is further weakened by limited public investments, insufficient child care market rates, and state payment practices that reduce child care programs’ financial security. These practices compound to produce meager profit margins, low wages for child care workers, and a lack of child care access for parents. One of the goals of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 (CCDBG) is to increase the number and percentage of low-income children in high-quality child care. In order to achieve this goal, government recommended in the final rule for the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) that states both increase child care subsidy rates and use grants and contracts to pay providers. Congress allocated about $8.7 billion in fiscal year 2020 to states through CCDF to support child care subsidies for low-income families. This investment makes the government the single largest purchaser of child care services, paying for the care of more than 1.3 million children each month. Child care subsidy payments are made directly to child care providers through child care subsidies that are distributed through certificates or vouchers. Federal regulations do not require states to pay specific payment rates. Instead, states are required to conduct a market rate survey at least every three years and use the results to set subsidy rates. Subject to approval, states also have an option to conduct an alternative methodology, such as cost modeling. As our prior brief The Limitations of Using Market Rates for Setting Child Care Subsidy Rates laid out, market rate surveys are a flawed methodology that fail to capture the true cost of providing child care and drive down child care subsidy rates. States have been gradually increasing their child care subsidy rates since the 2018 increase of the CCDBG by $2.37 billion, the largest single increase to CCDBG outside of emergency appropriations related to COVID-19. With the 2018 increase, 43 states and Washington, DC have increased rates, yet child care subsidy rates across the board are&hellip;",

UO College Republicans Face Backlash After Attending Proud Boys-Supported Rally James Croxton | Daily Emerald | December 4, 2020 In response to a social media post of a photo showing University of Oregon College Republicans at a “Stop the Steal” rally, in which flags of the Proud Boys can be seen in the background, the university’s student senate unanimously passed a resolution condemning white supremacy and mandating all organization leaders to attend cultural competency training, with some calling for student government to defund the College Republicans campus chapter. According to one student senator, “we are exploring all avenues to holding accountable.” The College Republicans leadership maintains that “our efforts at this rally have nothing to do with an endorsement of the Proud Boys” and that they have “condemned, and always will condemn white supremacy, racism and all other similar heinous human prejudices.” Hundreds of Academics Sign Open Letter Criticizing University of Mississippi’s Firing of History Professor First Amendment Watch | December 18, 2020 Expressing concern about a potential violation of academic freedom, “more than a thousand professors and graduate students have pledged not to speak at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) until the administration provides a ‘full and transparent’ account of the events that led to the firing of a well-regarded history professor.” The tenure-track professor, via social media, recently criticized a decision of the history department chair to reject a grant the professor had secured. In a letter to fellow members of the history department, the professor complained about the “decision to fire him without first consulting with other faculty members.” Ole Miss has announced it will allow the termination to proceed.

    "content": "Immigration detention has become a central facet of immigration enforcement over the last several decades, acting as a primary form of deterrence for unauthorized entries at the U.S. border. The population of those in detention has skyrocketed, with more than half a million individuals booked into detention facilities during fiscal year 2019. As detention needs have increased, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increasingly turned to private contractor-run facilities and leasing of space in county jails to accommodate the surge. Congress directed the Department of Homeland Security to reduce the population in detention to 40,050 by the end of FY2019, yet ICE held over 50,000 in detention at the end of the year and had an average daily population of more than 50,000 that same year. The United States is expected to spend $4,137,380 on detention in FY2021, per the president’s budget. The daily cost of detaining one adult in 2021 is estimated to be $125 per day, with the cost of detaining a mother with her child(ren) being $232 per day. However, a 2018 report from the Government Accountability Office found “a number of inconsistencies and errors” in ICE’s calculation methods for its congressional budget justifications that deflate the actual cost of detention. Alternatives to detention (ATDs) are policies that allow for the monitored release of immigrants from detention while their cases are pending. The intention of ATDs is to minimize the number of people being detained, limiting it to only those believed to pose high flight risks or threat to society. While the United States does utilize some alternatives to detention—primarily in the form of ankle monitoring bracelets, or “Intensive Supervision.” DHS under the Trump administration has maintained that the current ATD programs should “not be considered removal programs or a substitute for detention.” Instead, DHS claims ATD programs have enhanced ICE’s ability to monitor more intensively another subset of foreign nationals who are released into communities. As the federal government transitions to the Biden administration, there have been increased calls to reduce the population of those detained and utilize ATDs instead. ATDs are used around the world in place of detention, offering the United States examples of policy alternatives to its current program. ICE’s current ATD program, Intensive Supervision Appearance Program III (ISAP III) utilizes a combination of face-to-face and telephonic meetings, unannounced home visits, scheduled office visits, and court appearances to maintain surveillance of program participants. Additionally, technology is used for location tracking in the form of telephonic reporting, GPS tracking through ankle monitors, and through a smartphone application known as SmartLINK that allows participants to confirm their identities with facial recognition software. ICE reports high levels of compliance within the ISAP program. Ankle monitors have gained traction as a popular ATD method for immigration enforcement in the United States and are used extensively in the criminal justice system. Ankle monitors allow migrants to be released from detention while giving ICE constant access to their location. Costing as little as $4.50 per day, they are far less&hellip;",

    "content": "As winter continues, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are projected to increase. Despite the important actions taken by federal public health agencies to curb the pandemic, public trust in these agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration, and their world class career scientists has decreased during the pandemic. Many Americans are feeling pandemic fatigue, which has caused increased tension between federal health agencies, state governments, and the public, particularly around mask wearing, school closures, business lockdowns, and restrictions on gatherings. Public health leaders on the national and state level have even received death threats and other forms of intimidation in an effort to force them to change their policy positions. Fatigue from COVID-19 has worsened the polarization in the country and made the road to ending the pandemic much more difficult to navigate. Restoring trust in these institutions and our nation’s leading health experts is critical to making progress in fighting the coronavirus. According to a poll conducted August 28-September 3 by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), public confidence in the CDC dropped 16 percentage points since April 2020. When polling Republicans, the survey found confidence in the CDC fell from 90% to 60%, while confidence amongst Democrats dropped from 86% to 74% during the same period. While confidence decreased amongst both parties, the stark contrast indicates a partisan divide in how members of each party view the health agency. A key concern is that the Trump administration was often in disagreement with federal health agencies, which created doubt and polarized perceptions between the president’s supporters and others. The president has also targeted remarks at public health agencies and government officials, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and CDC Director Robert Redfield, further undermining their leadership and raising unfounded doubts about their expertise. Many Republicans have looked to the president for guidance on handling the virus. According to the same KFF poll, approximately half of Republicans believe that hydroxychloroquine is a possible treatment for COVID-19, despite evidence to the contrary. That is consistent with President Trump’s stated views on the subject months earlier. And 20% of people, irrespective of political party, believe wearing a mask is harmful to one’s health. In addition to a divide among party lines, there is historically lower trust between health care professionals and communities of color due to a legacy of discrimination and exploitation of Black Americans, such as in instances of unethical medical research like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. This distrust has carried over into the current pandemic even as, due to long-standing social and health inequities, communities of color have experienced a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and deaths. According to an updated KFF December poll, 35% of Black adults said they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated, compared to 26% of white and Hispanic Americans who said they definitely or probably would not get vaccinated.

    "content": "Following her maternity leave, Meghan McCain returned this week to co-host The View. In her first day back on the job she called for national mandate for paid maternity leave, and for this she was roundly – and shockingly – attacked. As a working mother of four and passionate advocate for paid family leave, I found this response appalling. These critics fail to see that there is boldness in her proposal, importance to her advocacy, and that shaming is not only wrong, but deeply damaging to the worthy cause they claim to advocate for. Meghan’s personal experience with maternal health issues has inspired her passion. To some, that seems to be her greatest sin. For example, politics writer Laura Bassett attacked her on Twitter writing: “I’ve never been pregnant, and I recognize the need for maternity leave. Why is an entire party unable to form political views based on empathy without having to be directly, personally affected by the policy?” Laura is of course right that we need more people to understand these issues, but she is wrong – ridiculously wrong – to criticize someone for speaking from their own personal experience. The attack is simply absurd. Did she attack Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, when he became an advocate for paid paternity leave following the birth of his first child with Serena Williams, who also suffered maternal health issues? Should Jimmy Kimmel be shamed by healthcare advocates for not using his platform until his own son had heart surgery, which inspired his advocacy and motivation? The attacks also center around her policy proposal not being good enough. It is not perfect, but she did not say she knows everything. Moreover, she is rightly aware that getting anything done this Congress will require compromise, so great cannot be the enemy of good, especially with so many families struggling to balance work and life. Meghan is just starting her journey on this issue, alongside her viewers and many Americans. As she, and they, learn more— if we don’t shame them into disinterest— we will likely learn both the reasons and political opportunities for paid maternity, paternity, family caregiving and medical leave. Some experts think they all require one comprehensive policy solution, and some think we should tackle one or two first. Either way, calling for a new mandate is bold for a Republican or a Democrat. More than 25 years ago, Congress passed the only family leave mandate, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides unpaid leave for workers (essentially job protection should you need to be out for up to 12 weeks’ time). The mandate covers maternity, paternity, family caregiving and medical leave but has not been updated with time. Nearly 40% of workers today do not qualify for FMLA (many low-income workers, new mothers and fathers who need it most), thus making it challenging for many families to care for their loved ones while maintaining financial security. As many states have shown in their own paid leave&hellip;",

    "content": "For the past several years, the process of extending the U.S. federal debt limit has become a political dance that has repeatedly disrupted markets and jeopardized global economic growth. It doesn’t have to be this way. For the past hundred years, the federal government has operated with a hard cap on its borrowing authority, requiring specific authorization from Congress to pay the obligations already incurred through tax and spending decisions. Ironically, the debt limit was originally designed to give the Treasury Department more borrowing flexibility, but the current structure has outlived its usefulness. Although the debt limit occasionally sparks a necessary debate among lawmakers on the fiscal health of the federal government, it simultaneously puts the full faith and credit of the United States at risk. For years, BPC has developed and advanced proposals to promote fiscal responsibility. We have also served a leading role in educating the public on the details of the debt limit, how it operates, and the risks associated with it. This work has led to a clear conclusion: the current debt limit procedure is the wrong tool to promote fiscal responsibility. With those issues in mind, BPC has crafted a framework for debt limit reform that achieves two objectives: first, to take the possibility of a default on the government’s obligations off the table; and second, to provide a vehicle to focus policymakers on the country’s broader fiscal challenges. This multipronged approach would not get rid of the debt limit; instead, it would require that any time the debt limit is extended, a more structured and serious discussion of the federal government’s fiscal priorities takes place.",

    "content": "When we look back at 2020 – we see lives lost to the pandemic, economic fallout from failures to contain the virus, continued struggles to address systemic racism, and an alarming number of women dropping out of the workforce. These problems loom so large, the moment demands both reflection and assessment of how our political “teams” can meet these challenges. The urge to step back from the daily grind and take stock comes as I depart my work family of 15 years – the Bipartisan Policy Center. As I reflect on what’s been accomplished at the organization I am so proud to have helped start and grow, I am struck by how much party identity drives EVERYTHING we think today. This self-defining label controls our perception of ourselves and solutions to the big problems more than our age, race, religion, geography, wealth, ethnicity, occupation, etc.  Party often provides a critical connection, a chance to be part of a larger effort, and I understand that desire. I grew up in the DC suburbs, where my dad worked at NASA (think nerdy, big glasses, short sleeve button-down shirt, skinny black tie) during the heyday of the space program. I enjoyed all the advantages of being born into an educated, white family. But I never felt like I belonged to a club. (We were Methodists – for me not a galvanizing cause; when I tell people where I’m from, I repeatedly hear that no one actually comes from DC). At 20, I decided to join a political party. I started working at the front desk for Rep Barbara Mikulski, a powerhouse in our party. Since then, I’ve worked for a Democrat President, a federal judge nominated by a Democrat, and I’ve volunteered on lots of campaigns – all for Democrats. Helping my “team” win is an awesome feeling, but it turns out that winning alone wasn’t my ultimate goal. For me, the most exciting and rewarding experiences &#8212; and the best outcomes for the country &#8212; come when politics and policy intersect. I want politicians to be political, to listen to their constituents and to their party. But I want them to be able to balance their ambitions with substantive solutions that can make lives of others better and make the planet better. Increasingly, though, we have watched political “teams” put winning above governing and above finding solutions for the country, which is just plain scary. At the BPC, we know that advocating for bipartisanship and compromise sounds and is old fashioned. But old-fashioned isn’t wrong or necessarily less effective. A whole generation of staffers – including my stepdaughter who, like me, started her career working the front desk for a Maryland Rep – and members of Congress only know this winner take all world. Listening to diverse voices and finding pragmatic policy paths forward is incredibly hard. Congress just enacted the annual government appropriations bill, COVID-relief, and a large energy package, among other year end items. It’s not the ideal way to&hellip;",

The Bipartisan Policy Center is confident there will be numerous opportunities for bipartisan agreement. As the transition to a new administration progresses, the early departure of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, while not unexpected, gives the Biden team a chance to affect the direction of the independent agency. Chairman Clayton began his tenure by signaling that he wanted bipartisan support for the polices the SEC took on. Unfortunately, with the hyperpartisan environment in Washington, D.C. that proved to be a difficult challenge. While criticized over his enforcement polices, the numbers actually show that under Clayton’s leadership the SEC brought more enforcement actions than his predecessor, including $14 billion in penalties and over ten thousand examinations. As for rulemakings, the SEC finalized over 65 rules including the Regulation Best Interest and amendments to Proxy Voting Advice rules both over partisan objections. As the exponential growth of ESG issues continues to flow south out of Wallstreet toward policymakers in Washington who the Biden team selects to lead the SEC will be vitally important for capital markets. Regardless of who is chosen, environmental, social, and governance policies will no doubt be at the forefront of discussions in the new administration and on Capitol Hill. BPC believes that there will be opportunities to reach bipartisan compromise on many of these issues and will continue to engage policymakers and the pubic as they are debated and discussed.",

The incoming Biden administration will have to confront growing pressure on both sides of the aisle to implement new tech policies to meet the challenges and opportunities present in an increasingly digital, interconnected world. Over the past year, the Bipartisan Policy Center has worked with policymakers, industry leaders, and civil society to develop a set of recommendations and principles to create a national strategy for artificial intelligence. Specifically, the issue of AI ethics is one topic that the new Congress and administration should pay close attention to. Here are three broad ethical questions that should be explored: How can we reduce harmful bias? Just as humans have biases, AI algorithms can show bias due to the data they use and the algorithmic design, which can disadvantage many marginalized groups. Unfair bias can further disadvantage these groups and lead to unfair outcomes, such as the misidentification of a suspect by a facial recognition software. How do we define and promote fairness? AI algorithms have no inherent sense of what is fair. For instance, an AI system cannot by itself determine how to allocate resources when conflicting definitions of fairness exist, such as how an autonomous vehicle should balance the safety of a driver with the safety of the passenger in hazardous situations. How can we protect privacy? AI technology also amplifies existing privacy concerns, such as rules around data collection, and raises new ones, such as whether and when AI systems can be used to monitor employees. These questions will not have simple answers and will be context specific. However, BPC has put forth several ideas and recommendations to guide AI ethics going forward. 1. Fund and support research and development projects that address bias, fairness and privacy issues associated with AI. The government should support R&amp;D for technical and non-technical research to address ethical challenges presented by AI. Technical research can help address the challenges of improving AI system design. For instance, research may find better ways to design an AI system to reduce the likelihood that private data is unintentionally shared or find techniques to help make AI decision-making more transparent for end-users. However, technological solutions will not be enough. Many AI ethics questions involve deep philosophical questions about what is fair and just that can only be answered by humans. Funding non-technical and multidisciplinary research, such as studies by ethicists, economists, and sociologists, can provide necessary insights and inform guidelines about where the use of AI technology is appropriate and the societal implications it might have. This research can also be used for designing ethics classes for STEM and computer science disciplines. 2. Encourage diversity in AI talent to mitigate harmful bias and promote fairness in AI practices. A diverse workforce can help better reflect society’s values in AI systems. First, a more diverse group of people can better catch poor assumptions or biased datasets in designing AI systems. For example, an&hellip;",

We also bring you accounts of student protests in reaction to administrators’ statements and social media posts. Students Demand Accountability Following Instagram Post  Elizabeth LaCroix, Ellie Wolfe, and Amelia Keleher | Bates Student | November 6, 2020  “The Bates Communications Office posted a slideshow online featuring eleven students who were voting in their first presidential election… All but one of the eleven students featured in the series belonged to either neutral or left-leaning student organizations.” The exception was a post featuring the president of the school’s College Republicans, quoted as saying that the club was “a space where you can support a Republican candidate without… being baselessly labeled as hateful.” In response to that post, the student government organized a protest, which drew hundreds. Protesters presented five demands, including a required “commitment from all affiliated Bates student organizations to anti-racism work.” Bates President Clayton Spencer initially defended the post with a statement: “Any attempt to filter out certain voices is unacceptable, particularly in a campus community that should prize free and open discourse.” However, Spencer later appeared at the protest and apologized for “the added harm, fear, and feelings of unsafety inflicted on the Bates community.” “It was incredibly insensitive of me to speak out about the election without taking that into account,” Spencer said.  Statement on Faculty, Free Expression, and Diversity  Robert J. Zimmer | Office of the President, University of Chicago | November 29, 2020  The University of Chicago administration reaffirmed its commitment to academic freedom and free expression in the wake of an open letter responding to a tenured professor’s YouTube videos—since removed—arguing that the department discriminated against white and Asian candidates in admissions and hiring. The open letter calls for graduate students to be released from his supervision and undergraduates to be released from his courses, as well as nine other measures. President Zimmer asserts that “no individual member of the faculty speaks for the university as a whole on any subject… In turn, the university will continue to defend vigorously any faculty member’s right to publish and discuss his or her ideas.” Over 12,000 have signed a petition in support of  free speech rights.   Faculty Letter Petitions Georgetown to Develop Accountability Criteria for Outgoing Trump Officials  Guilia Testa | The Hoya | December 3, 2020  “Faculty in the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service drafted an open letter calling for university leadership to implement accountability standards to consider former officials from President Donald Trump’s administration for campus invitations and appointments&#8230; The letter appeals to the necessity of developing these criteria by claiming the actions of many officials who had served in the previous administration were incompatible with Georgetown’s values.” Over 200 faculty, alumni, and students have signed the letter, the stated purpose of which is not “to advocate for a general ban on Trump administration officials” but to “highlight the need for a critical examination of speaker invitation policies by university administrators.” The Georgetown document follows the example of a similar measure from Harvard University.  Sens.

    "content": "The United States has long prided itself on its history of being a melting pot of cultures, races, and creeds. However, critiques over the United States’ ability to successfully support and integrate immigrants into its society has recently surfaced. In reaction to the changing demographic makeup of communities across the United States, nativist concerns over immigration have grown stronger, making the need for a more comprehensive integration policy more apparent. Unlike some European counterparts, the United States does not have a federal integration policy. This leaves the task of integrating and supporting immigrants to individual state or local governments and local civic organizations. Without federal support, they frequently lack enough funding to properly establish long-standing integration programs. Ultimately, many immigrants are forced to navigate integration into the United States largely through personal trial and error. This raises an important question: How can the United States better facilitate the integration of immigrants in an environment colored by increasing divisiveness and political polarization surrounding their presence? To answer this question, we examined the integration policies of three countries in Europe that promote immigrant integration against a background of rising anti-immigrant sentiment. We found that in each country, federal policies support regional and municipal governments charged with the day-to-day care of the immigrants in their communities. Germany, Spain, and Denmark each provide U.S. policymakers with different windows into why developing a federal integration policy is a necessary component of reforming our immigration system, increasing the success of immigrants in the United States, and benefiting the country overall. From the case studies presented above, there are three important takeaways for the United States, should it consider developing a national strategic immigrant integration policy. If the United States hopes to better integrate immigrants into the fabric of society, a more comprehensive and robust national integration policy is needed. While states and local governments undoubtedly understand what programs best suit the immigrants in their communities, a federal strategy, complimented with federal funding, would bolster both new and preexisting integration efforts. Whether that is decreasing language barriers within the immigration system itself or ensuring that U.S. civics courses compliment English-language learning programs, policymakers need to consider how a comprehensive integration policy can not only better support immigrants themselves but also facilitate a more inclusive and welcoming society overall. 1 In a 1982 speech, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared that Germany was not a country of immigration. Kohl was an outspoken supporter of the idea that Turkish guestworkers, who had been living in Germany since the 1960s, should be sent back to their homeland. 2 The “Welcome to Germany” brochure is available in available in over 10 languages, including Arabic, Farsi, and Bulgarian. 3 Frankfurt should not be mistaken with the aforementioned Frankfurt-an-der-Oder. These are two distinct cities – Frankfurt is in central Germany, while Frankfurt-an-der-Oder is in eastern Germany on the border with Poland. 4 The country also adopted national integration plans before this period. In 1994, the national integration plan was adopted by the government,&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis have placed unprecedented strain on public higher education. State budgets are under increased pressure, enrollment is declining, and institutions themselves are facing significant new costs associated with implementing online learning and virus prevention. In March, Congress supplied $14 billion in direct aid to public and private higher education institutions through the CARES Act. This emergency funding provided critical support to higher education, but it covered less than half of the pandemic’s impact on public higher education revenues—to say nothing of major COVID-related spending increases. As the pandemic continues to rage, however, postsecondary finances remain in dire straits, and schools need additional support to weather the crisis. As we detailed in a previous blog, states tend to cut funding for higher education during recessions. In response, institutions have historically relied on tuition revenues to fill the gap, buoyed by an increase in enrollment as displaced workers seek new skills. But this is a different type of crisis. Overall enrollment declined by 3% this fall and tuition grew at its lowest rate in three decades, as institutions forwent increases—or opted for more modest ones—in light of the economic situation and the move to online instruction. At the same time, auxiliary revenues from campus housing, dining operations, and other campus facility rentals are estimated to have fallen by 25%. On the other side of the ledger, institutions face ballooning costs, particularly related to virus management. Institutions report incurring COVID-specific costs more than 15% greater than what was anticipated. This created a perfect storm for public higher education, and without the ability to rely on tuition revenue to fill these gaps, schools turned to federal assistance through the CARES Act to alleviate some of the pressure. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that total higher education revenues at public institutions from state appropriations, tuition, and auxiliary services will decline by nearly $7 billion, or 3%, in the 2021 fiscal year. If not for CARES Act funding, this number would be almost twice as large—at $12 billion, or roughly 6%. COVID-related cost increases would make the overall budget gap even wider. To derive these figures, BPC used a model developed by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems and the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. BPC estimated total instruction-related and auxiliary revenues in each state with and without the CARES Act funding for FY2021 (Figure 1). The model relies on a baseline constructed from the most recent data available. As such, these figures should be viewed as a rough estimate, and not as a precise measure, of higher education revenue in any state. They do, however, provide insight into the relative magnitude of the pandemic’s impact across the country. It should also be noted that the aggregate revenue decline masks large discrepancies among states. For example, revenues at Montana’s public two-year colleges would have fallen by an estimated 12% in the absence of CARES Act funding, whereas revenues for the same group of institutions in Idaho would&hellip;",

    "content": "Today’s college students increasingly include part-time and adult learners, as well as working students and student parents. For these students, unexpected events and costs, such as a car repair, lost income, or disruption in child care arrangements, can derail their path to graduation. COVID-19 has exacerbated these problems, dramatically increasing financial insecurity among students across the country. In response to the crisis, Congress enacted temporary reforms to the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program to provide flexible, emergency support to low-income students. Because financial insecurity will undoubtedly continue to threaten student progress after the pandemic ends, making these reforms permanent and better targeting FSEOG funding would boost retention during this economic downturn and beyond. FSEOG is a form of federal need-based grant aid that flows directly to institutions, which then distribute these funds to students on campus. Grants range from $100 to $4,000, and institutions disburse these funds at the beginning of each term, prioritizing low-income students. Institutions must match at least a third of their federal allocation. In the 2018-19 academic year, the federal grants amounted to nearly $835 million for about 1.6 million students. While research shows that grant aid increases college enrollment and persistence, the FSEOG program’s effectiveness has been limited by its inability to respond to specific events. If a student faces an unexpected cost during the term, they have not traditionally been able to apply for further FSEOG funding, despite evidence that suggests as little as $300 in additional financial aid can promote college completion. This has left students vulnerable to expenses that can threaten their college progress. Another problem is that the program’s outdated distribution formula sends federal funds disproportionately to private colleges and universities, which tend to enroll a smaller share of low-income students than public institutions. While only 17% of Pell Grant dollars are awarded to students at private nonprofit colleges, a third of FSEOG funds flow to that sector. COVID-19 has led to widespread financial insecurity, meaning that an increasing number of students likely need additional support to respond to incidental expenses. Surveys suggest that 58% of students experienced food or housing insecurity this spring, with especially high rates of basic-needs insecurity among Black and Hispanic or Latino students. The same survey showed that one-in-three employed students lost their job because of the pandemic. Financial insecurity is especially rampant among low-income students who face unexpected costs and lost income at higher rates than their more affluent peers. The temporary reforms enacted through the CARES Act allow institutions to disburse FSEOG funds as micro-grants to students with financial need and transfer leftover Federal Work Study funds to FSEOG coffers. This flexibility, however, is only available through a period of “qualifying emergency” related to COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Task Force on Higher Education Financing and Student Outcomes recognized the need to provide cash assistance to students who face unexpected financial difficulties that threaten their academic progress. The task force recommended permanent reforms to FSEOG allowing institutions to&hellip;",

It represents a needed return to the collaborative congressional response that marked the beginning of the pandemic, and we hope it sets the tone for a more productive 2021 and beyond. We understand that the nature of a moderate package means that not everyone gets what they want. That said, there’s an obvious bipartisan component missing from the deal: paid leave. In a season of rampant COVID-19 infections, remote school, and rolling child care closures, providing workers with paid time off to prevent contagion and care for loved ones is common sense, if not life-saving. Paid leave has been supported by leaders across the political spectrum, from President Trump to Speaker Pelosi. It was included in the first big COVID package this spring, called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). Within FFCRA&#8217;s paid leave program, businesses were reimbursed for providing paid sick and family leave to their employees to reduce costs facing businesses amidst financial pressures and keep workers facing caregiving dilemmas employed. Those provisions are now set to expire at year’s end and should be extended. The reasons for supporting a federal paid leave program during a public health crisis have not changed. If anything, they have grown stronger given the rise in cases, unequal labor market fallout, and new research on the role of paid leave during the pandemic: The urgent need for pandemic relief suggests that no good effort be stalled in want of the perfect. That said, it is our sincere hope that either now, or at some point in early 2021 Congress addresses paid leave. It is a policy lever uniquely suited for the fallout from this crisis. An emergency extension of FFCRA for the winter months would help to limit the virus spread and provide businesses and families with more options for weathering the storm until the vaccine. Every worker should have access to paid sick leave in a public health crisis. But more than that, the absence of paid leave points just how challenging it&#8217;s become for working parents (and in particular women) to juggle child care and workplace responsibilities in a culture that tends to minimize caregiving responsibilities while keeping up the veneer that people can &#8220;have it all,&#8221; suggesting that the problem is more with the worker (woman) than the company or national policy &#8211; even in a pandemic! Paid leave can help to ease some of that tension. It enjoys widespread public support, is pro-work, pro-family, and cost-effective. There are many ways that paid family leave can be provided in a bipartisan way, both in this crisis and beyond it &#8211; including through reforms to the unemployment insurance system that could cross political lines, as one of us has proposed. The bipartisan effort at delivering COVID-19 relief gives us hope of a sea change in Washington, that there will be more room to consider cross-cutting reforms that strengthen the foundation of America’s economy and families.

    "content": "Higher education administrators, tasked with maintaining a school’s commitments to free expression, address everything from open inquiry protections to speech code reforms. Looking beyond policies, the task of fostering a campus culture which both celebrates viewpoint diversity and acknowledges our country’s history of censorship can be especially challenging, yet crucial to the health of academe. From the Sedition Act of 1798 to the twentieth-century Hays Code, the suppression of unpopular speech and modes of thought is ingrained in the fabric of American society. This history cannot be ignored at colleges and universities, which are meant to teach their students the contexts from which intellectual traditions emerge and develop. While our national discourse considers the novel First Amendment issues of the Digital Age, some of the most robust debate has focused on an old-fashioned form of censorship: book banning. Suppressing the ideas and arguments within a book might seem archaic, but in 2018 the American Library Association reported challenges to 483 books, including popular titles like The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini. This kind of advocacy for censorship is not limited to the reading habits of elementary and secondary school students; lawmakers and school administrators have frequently taken measures to regulate what adult students read at colleges and universities. But a deeper challenge for administrators arises when students themselves launch campaigns to censor or prohibit unpopular texts on campus, as they did in 2019 when underclassmen at Georgia Southern University torched copies of Jennine Capó Crucet’s bestselling Make Your Home Among Strangers on a charcoal grill. The incident was precipitated by a First Year Experience event at which Crucet argued with participants about white privilege and diversity. Part of a university’s free expression goals routinely include building tolerance and endowing students with an ability to engage with perspectives different from their own. In pursuit of this objective, professors at colleges and universities across the country have developed versions of a “university blacklist” course. Teaching books and authors that have provoked censorship, sanitization, or de-platforming attempts, professors spotlight the tenets of intellectual freedom for a new crop of students. Engaging with controversial books and authors can be an ideal sparring ground on which students learn to grapple with unfamiliar or contentious ideas. The university blacklist course encourages students to engage directly with books that have provoked offense in the past or even in the present, and to learn to analyze the source of the text’s power. Generally, these courses fit into one of two categories, both of which capture a different lens through which we may consider censorship. Using the rhetorical approach, professors focus on the arguments of authors who have courted controversy in recent years. In 2018, two professors at Claremont McKenna College co-taught a seminar that took their students on a “stereotype-shattering journey through controversial opinions about some of society’s most emotionally charged issues.” The class’ politically diverse group of students unpacked books on modern feminism, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and race in America.&hellip;",

    "content": "The 2020 election season did not end when the polls closed on November 3. Election Day is simply the most visible moment in the months-long process to select the President of the United States. When you cast your vote for president, you are not actually voting directly for that specific candidate. Rather, you are voting for the slate of electors already selected by that candidate’s political party. Together, the slates of electors chosen by voters in each state make up the Electoral College, which is the body established by Article II of the U.S. Constitution that ultimately elects the President and Vice President of the United States. The Electoral College process is extensive and multi-faceted, but the three critical milestones taking place this December are (1) the Safe Harbor deadline, (2) the casting of electors’ votes, and (3) the deadline for receipt of these results by the President of the Senate. RSVP to our fourth post-presidential election cycle event on Dec. 15 U.S. Code requires that states resolve all election-related disputes six days before electors cast their votes. States are expected to complete recounts, resolve any legal challenges, and certify results by this date, commonly known as the “Safe Harbor” deadline. Typically, state governors also prepare Certificates of Ascertainment by this date, which include the names of electors, certified election results, and the state’s official seal. States are required to certify results and prepare Certificates of Ascertainment “as soon as practicable” after the election, but they must deliver the certificates to the U.S. Archivist and the state’s slate of electors no later than December 14. If a state succeeds in meeting the Safe Harbor Deadline, their results are considered conclusive and legally binding when sent to Congress for counting. U.S. Code dictates that electors shall meet and vote on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December of presidential election years. This year, that date falls on December 14. On this day electors meet in their respective states at a location, set by the state legislature (usually the state capital), and vote by paper ballot for President and Vice President. After electors vote, they sign six “Certificates of the Vote,” each of which includes a list of votes for President and a list of votes for Vice President. Each Certificate of the Vote is then packaged together with a Certificate of Ascertainment. The resulting six official certificates are then distributed to the President of the Senate, the Archivist, and the state’s secretary of state and District Court judge. The prospect of “faithless electors”—or electors who vote for someone other than their party’s nominee—has been a hotly debated topic. However, this only occurs on rare occasions and has never altered a presidential election outcome. Furthermore, 33 states and the District of Columbia require electors to vote for the candidate chosen by voters during the popular vote. The aforementioned certificates—each including the names of electors, the electors’ votes, and the state’s certified election results—must be delivered to all relevant parties by the&hellip;",

Emergency measures targeted at supporting working families—including expanded unemployment insurance and paid leave benefits—are scheduled to lapse at the end of December. With the crisis far from over, lawmakers must act before the end of the year to extend support and avoid a dramatic financial cliff for millions of working families. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed immense challenges for American businesses, workers, and families. The sudden decline in economic activity this spring roiled labor markets, and more than half a year later, unemployment remains elevated and labor force participation is still below pre-recession levels. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly harmful for women, who have been disproportionately impacted on two fronts: employment and caregiving. First, women-dominated industries such as retail, hospitality, and education and health services have absorbed the brunt of job losses. On top of that, the combination of school (and child care center) closures and COVID illness has resulted in unprecedented caregiving needs. A recent BPC-Morning Consult survey found that 21% of women who left their job (voluntarily or involuntarily) during the pandemic did so due to caregiving responsibilities. Moreover, the poll found that women were twice as likely as men (16% vs. 8%) to have left employment due to caregiving responsibilities specifically caused by school and child care closures. The result is that about 2.2 million women have left the labor force since the start of the pandemic compared to 1.4 million men. Stripping away federal supports for caregivers and parents would only lead to greater, more permanent exits from the labor force. In anticipation of the widespread labor market impacts of the pandemic, Congress dramatically increased the scope of unemployment compensation to cover millions of additional workers through two programs in the CARES Act. Congress should extend the CARES Act emergency UI programs through the end of June 2021 and provide at least an additional 13 weeks of benefits. Under Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), displaced workers who are ineligible for regular unemployment insurance (UI) can access up to 39 weeks of benefits. PUA fills in key coverage gaps for millions of workers whose ability to work is impacted by the pandemic, including those with greater caregiving responsibilities as a result of school or child care closures. This is not an insignificant population: another BPC-Morning Consult poll found that 26% of those receiving any kind of UI benefit primarily spend their time caregiving rather than actively looking for work. PUA also extends eligibility to new types of workers, including gig economy and self-employed workers typically left out of state unemployment systems. The CARES Act also provides additional support for those collecting regular UI benefits. Most states offer 26 weeks of regular UI, but Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) offers an additional 13 weeks of federally funded eligibility to those who have exhausted their regular UI benefits, mirroring the total benefit period offered through PUA.&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has reemphasized the fact that child care is an essential support for working parents, crucial to children’s successful development, and the backbone of a community’s economic development. Even prior to the pandemic, child care providers operated on thin profit margins and were in need of additional funds to provide quality care for young children and keep their businesses afloat. The onset of the pandemic, however, fractured an already risky business model, leaving providers without certainty that they could maintain their businesses and reliably serve their communities’ children and families. Providers have also struggled to both access and afford personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to help create safe spaces for their children and providers. Despite numerous obstacles, child care providers have risen to the challenge of supporting families and children throughout this crisis. To better understand the issues child care providers are facing, the Bipartisan Policy Center conducted a series of interviews with both home-based and center-based child care providers in August 2020. These providers self-selected to participate and were asked to provide a voice to the challenges they were facing as they continued to serve their communities through the pandemic. What emerged was a nuanced understanding of the unique position that child care occupies as a small business and as a provider of an essential social service. In these conversations, BPC heard a consistent call for more public investment in child care, tailored to meet the industry’s specific needs. Several key themes were highlighted through these interviews—and this is what we heard. “We have a lot of families that do want to work. They are essential workers, they want to be out there, they want to be working every day…So now not having is going to have a huge, huge economic hit to our local areas, where we’re going to have a lot of families deciding to stay home rather than be able to work.” &#8211;Laura Larson, Family Focus—Brunswick, ME Child care is essential to the economic health of the country and to rebuilding the economy as the nation recovers from COVID-19. Laura Larson at Family Focus in Brunswick, ME, stated that working families, burdened with child care and school closures amid the pandemic, need consistent and stable child care to remain in the workforce. Rhonda Rivers of LeafSpring Schools in Charlotte, NC, echoed this argument, stating that child care providers are the “workforce behind the workforce.” Both Ann Elliot of the Family Resource Center in Pittsburg, KS, and Cortaiga Collins of Good Shepherd Preschool and Infant/Toddler Center in St. Louis, MO, made the case for ongoing public funding for child care, without which programs will have no choice but to close, leaving a devastating impact on the economy. Cassandra Brooks of Little Believer’s Academy in Clayton, NC, and Terria Ashby of Bella’s Playhouse in Ulysses, KS, also add that the child care industry has proven itself to be a dependable resource to families and communities throughout this crisis and is therefore&hellip;",

    "content": "In a recent virtual event hosted by BPC and the Heurich House Museum, panel member Jeff Alfaro, an immigrant who came to the United States at age 20 from the Philippines and started his own small business, expressed that gaining citizenship that allowed him to vote and have a voice in our electoral system was his biggest “American Dream.” This sentiment is often true for many foreign-born individuals who live, work, and pay taxes in the United States. Recent research shows that more immigrants who gain U.S. citizenship through naturalization1 are engaging in the U.S. elections by voting, and want to represent their respective communities by becoming elected officials. According to American Community Survey estimates, 22 million foreign-born individuals were naturalized as of 2017. This figure represents 49% of the 44 million immigrants in the United States. According to the Pew Research Center, between 2009 and 2019, 7.2 million immigrants became U.S. citizens through naturalization. According to BPC’s report on naturalizations, nearly 8 in 10 naturalized citizens are born in Latin America or Asia and Asian immigrants have the highest naturalization rates. The largest increase in naturalization rates between 2005 and 2015 was among Indian and Ecuadorian immigrants with eligible immigrants from Vietnam and Iran having the highest overall rates of naturalizations in 2015. However, as of 2017, naturalization rates among Mexican immigrants, who are still the largest foreign-born group within the United States, remains the lowest among any nationality. Among lawful Mexican immigrants who are eligible to apply for citizenship, only 42% had applied for and obtained citizenship by 2015. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the United States had 843,593 naturalizations in 2019, the highest number since 2008, when the United States naturalized over 1 million people. Naturalization provides new opportunities for immigrants to participate in U.S. electoral politics. In 2020, naturalized citizens made up 1 in 10 eligible U.S. voters—more than 23 million naturalized U.S. immigrants were eligible to vote. The population of foreign-born citizens who are eligible to vote has risen by 93% since 2000, a much higher rate than U.S.-born eligible voters, which only grew around 18% during the same period. While naturalized immigrant voters make up an increasing part of the overall electorate, their participation rates vary. Hispanic and Asian foreign-born naturalized immigrants form the largest percentage of the naturalized eligible voter population in the United States. In 2016, Hispanics and Asian foreign-born citizens had a higher voter turnout than their U.S.-born counterparts; 53% of eligible Hispanic naturalized immigrants voters voted as compared to 46% of U.S born Hispanics. Similarly, among Asian naturalized citizens registered to vote, turnout was around 52% compared to 45% of the U.S.-born Asian population. However, overall, naturalized citizens vote at lower rate than native-born voters. In 2016, while 62% of the U.S.-born electorate turned out to vote while foreign-born naturalized voters lagged at around 54%. In recent years, for immigrants who have naturalized, engagement in the U.S. political system has not been confined to voting but also running&hellip;",

Universities Halt Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Programs, Fearing Loss of Federal Funds First Amendment Watch | October 8, 2020 The University of Iowa and John A. Logan College halted campus diversity, equity, and inclusion training programs in response to a September 22 executive order from President Donald Trump, which prohibited recipients of federal grants from promoting “race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating.” The schools paused their diversity initiatives to give administrators time to evaluate training, workshops, and programs for compliance with the order. Critics have warned that the order likely violates the First Amendment. UNI Student Government Blocks Anti-Abortion Group from Forming a Chapter, Says It Could Create a Hostile Environment Cleo Krejci | Des Moines Register | October 16, 2020 “Student government leaders at the University of Northern Iowa&#8230; denied students&#8217; request to form a local chapter of Students for Life of America, a national nonprofit that opposes abortion, saying that allowing the student group to form could create a hostile environment on campus.” After the decision was upheld by the student government Supreme Court, the anti-abortion group appealed to UNI President Mark Nook, who reversed the student government ruling, arguing that “this was a decision that ultimately came down to the First Amendment and students’ right to not only free speech, but free assembly.” SU Political Groups Unite Against Residence Hall Sign Ban Derek Dengler, Thomas Tang, and Alexander Stone | The Quill | October 29, 2020 In a public letter, student leaders of political clubs at Susquehanna University respond to an instruction from administrators to remove all political signage from publicly viewable areas of student residences. “While it is perfectly clear that SU has full discretion in the policy to request removal of any outdoor decorations, having political decorations inside has no such limitations in the student handbook&#8230;. As the presidents of the SU Democrat’s Club, SU Republican’s Club, and Young Americans For Liberty, we cannot and will not accept such unjustifiable limitations on our rights to free speech. We stand united past the political divide to challenge and urge the administration to swiftly change its decision.” Academic Freedom Questions Arise on Campus Over COVID-19 Strategy Conflicts Kate Chesley | Stanford News | October 30, 2020 At an October 22 Faculty Senate meeting, Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne defended Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at Stanford think tank the Hoover Institution and special advisor to President Donald Trump for the coronavirus, after 98 Stanford physicians published an open letter arguing they have “both a moral and an ethical responsibility to call attention to falsehoods and misrepresentations of science.” Tessier-Lavigne cited the university’s Statement on Academic Freedom, stating that the “function of the university would be seriously eroded if we were to publicly take sides either to disavow or to support the specific positions of a faculty member engaged&hellip;",

    "content": "In the immediate response to the coronavirus pandemic, as stay-at-home orders shut down businesses and millions of workers were furloughed or laid off, Congress dramatically expanded unemployment insurance benefits through the CARES Act. The $600 supplemental weekly benefit—which lapsed at the end of July amidst ongoing partisan disagreement—was one of these expansions, but two other emergency unemployment insurance programs are set to expire at the end of this year: Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC). As the inequitable nature of the economic recovery becomes increasingly apparent, lawmakers must carefully consider the extent to which these programs should be modified or extended. Large portions of the workforce are normally ineligible for UI, including self-employed workers, independent contractors, gig economy workers, and those who choose to only seek part-time work. Additionally, while eligibility for UI varies by state, generally only people who lose their job through no fault of their own can claim benefits, and workers must also meet wage and work-history qualifications. These restrictions render the regular UI system ill-equipped to handle the COVID-19 crisis. For example, UI does not cover workers who are sick or requiring self-quarantine from COVID-19. Those who have had additional caregiving responsibilities due to school or child care closures are similarly excluded from UI. PUA fills these gaps in the UI system, providing up to 39 weeks of benefits to workers left out of regular UI, including those who have been furloughed or those who quit their jobs for reasons related to COVID-19. In some cases, PUA’s expanded coverage serves as a public health measure, enabling those who are sick or requiring self-quarantine from COVID-19 to stay home. Workers whose place of work is closed due to stay-at-home order restrictions can also claim PUA, as can those with greater caregiving responsibilities brought on by the crisis. In fact, a BPC-Morning Consult Poll found that 26% of those receiving any kind of UI are primarily spending their time caregiving rather than looking for work. PUA is largely based on Disaster Unemployment Assistance, which has long been available to workers affected by a major disasters like hurricanes). Yet PUA’s unprecedented scope required states to quickly stand up brand new administrative structures to provide benefits to these expanded populations. Many state systems in turn initially struggled to implement PUA, with millions of claimants waiting weeks—or even longer—to receive benefits. More than 9 million workers are currently collecting benefits through PUA, which is about 2.5 million more than the number of workers collecting regular UI. Even if Congress acts to extend the program, without additional weeks of eligibility, workers who have been collecting PUA since March will run out of benefits by the end of the year. In most states, regular UI benefits run out after 26 weeks. PEUC provides federal funding to extend these benefits an additional 13 weeks, mirroring the 39 weeks a worker can claim PUA. Over 4 million Americans are currently collecting PEUC, a figure that will likely grow as workers laid&hellip;",

    "content": "Election Day did not end with a decisive outcome. Counting the votes takes time, and close margins of victory in many states mean that we will be seeing some recounts to confirm the outcome. But not every recount is the same, and some aren’t even recounts. In Georgia, the margin between President Donald Trump and now President-Elect Joe Biden stands at 14,000 votes, well within the allowable recount provisions laid out by state law. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) said on Wednesday that election officials will be conducting a “hand recount” of all ballots for the presidential race to be completed by November 18. He has referred to this process as a recount, a recanvass, and an audit, despite all of these being unique acts in election administration. Hand recounts are not permitted by Georgia law. But the public seems to be demanding one. Moreover, the state was already planning to conduct a risk-limiting audit to verify accuracy of the results. So, audit or recount? Here’s what’s happening. Recounts and audits are distinct processes. A recount occurs after an election when the margin between candidates is narrow, or if a candidate asks for a recount. Recounts are a literal counting of ballots, sometimes by hand, to confirm the result. Some states have automatically triggered recounts for contests decided within a small margin; other states offer an option for a recount when a candidate requests it. Georgia does not have automatic recounts, but a candidate can request a recount after certification. Contrary to recounts, an audit seeks to verify that the primary counting method is accurate. In Georgia, Risk Limiting Audits, or RLAs, are required by state statute. In an RLA, a certain number of ballots are audited based on the margin of victory between candidates in the race selected for auditing. Closer margins require more ballots to be reviewed in order to achieve a high standard of statistical confidence in the overall result. The process involves taking a small batch of ballots from precincts based on a unique identifier. Even pulling a few hundred ballots can be labor intensive. For contests with very small margins of victory, manually auditing all ballots is more efficient. Audits are important. BPC recommends that states use audits to instill confidence in the reported outcome. While an RLA cannot confirm a 100% accurate count of the initial results—since it is not a full recount and therefore can only provide confidence within a specific interval—it offers a sound statistical check on the voting process that is sufficient in most cases. So, what is happening in Georgia right now? Raffensperger ordered a hand-tally of all ballots across the state. One may think that this is a recount, but there are two reasons it is not. First, recounts in Georgia are not done by hand. Second, in Georgia, the results must be certified before a recount can be requested while an audit—per BPC’s recommendation—occurs before certification. So, the Georgia maneuverings must be an RLA, right? Not&hellip;",

    "content": "The results of the 2020 election continue to be finalized, but one possible outcome is an evenly divided Senate sometime after January 5, 2021. This raises questions regarding which party will hold the majority and who the majority leader will be, as well as whether we should anticipate a completely deadlocked Senate on every vote, among others. Here are seven things you need to know Based on current projections, there will be at least 50 Republican senators in the next Congress. There will be no fewer than 48 Democratic senators. And two Senate races, both in Georgia, are not yet determined as they are headed to runoffs in January 2021. Georgia’s election rules require a candidate to receive a majority of the votes cast in order to be declared the winner. If no candidate does so in the general election, a runoff takes place between the top two candidates. For the 2020 general election, that runoff would be scheduled on January 5, 2021. In 2020, Georgia had two Senate races. Sen. David Perdue (R) was up for re-election as his regular six-year term will expire at the end of the current Congress. Neither Perdue nor his opponent, Jon Ossoff likely received the votes necessary to avoid a runoff. Georgia also had a special election for its other Senate seat. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) retired partway through his term—one scheduled to end in 2022—on December 31, 2019. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) appointed Kelly Loeffler (R) to fill the vacancy until the 2020 election could determine who would serve through 2022. Neither Loeffler nor her Democratic opponent, Rev. Raphael Warnock, seem likely to break the 50% mark. In the event both Democratic candidates win the runoffs, their party will also have 50 Senate seats. The current Congress, the 116th, will conclude sometime between now and January 3, 2021, and at Noon that day the 117th Congress will begin (unless the date is delayed by an act of the 116th Congress). Here are the likely scenarios: Rs Ds VP Presumptive Majority Start of 117th Congress 3-Jan 51 48 Pence Republican 2 D candidates win GA runoff 5-Jan 50 50 Pence Republican 20-Jan 50 50 Harris Democratic 1 R, 1D win GA runoff 5-Jan 51 49 Pence Republican 20-Jan 51 49 Harris Republican 2 R candidates win GA runoff 5-Jan 52 48 Pence Republican 20-Jan 52 48 Harris Republican January 3: Even with both Georgia general elections undecided, Loeffler will still occupy the seat she was appointed to and currently holds, advantaging Republicans. Perdue’s term expires with the end of the 116th Congress and that seat becomes temporarily vacant. January 6: The Georgia runoff is scheduled for January 5. Depending on how quickly the race is decided, the winners could be sworn in as senators as early as that evening, but most likely sometime after. The Senate is the judge of its own elections. If there are irregularities or the results are challenged, the winners may be delayed in assuming office until those&hellip;",

Quality early child care and education can help facilitate the holistic development of all children, improving both their cognitive and social-emotional functioning and their physical health. In this way, the foundation built through quality early childhood programs improves a child’s chances to grow and learn across all aspects of their lives. Early child care and education leads to improved long and short-term health outcomes, language development, social-emotional development, and school readiness—all of which can contribute to enhanced, successful life outcomes. In addition to rapid brain development, early childhood is a time of fast physical changes, meaning that a child’s early experiences have the potential to affect their lifelong health. Studies have found that children who received quality early care and education had significantly better health into their mid-30s than their counterparts who did not participate in these programs. This improved health begins upon enrollment, as research suggests that participation in Head Start is associated with increased health screenings, immunizations, and dental exams.1 Participation in quality early programs has also been found to decrease rates of obesity, contributing to lower body mass indexes for enrolled children.2 Through adolescence and adulthood, children enrolled in quality early care and education programs saw lower blood pressure and cortisol levels, and improved cardiovascular and metabolic health. 3 4 5 6 Further, positive early learning experiences can help prevent chronic diseases, such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes.7 In addition to directly impacting health outcomes, studies have shown that quality early care and education prompts healthier lifestyle choices and behaviors. Female participants were more likely to eat nutritious foods at age 21, more likely to exercise, and significantly less likely to start drinking before age 17, and participants of both genders were less likely to smoke cigarettes.89 The foundation for language development begins at birth. Research shows that vocabulary use at age 3 is predictive of language proficiency through at least fifth grade and is also a predictor of future academic and social success. Studies have also shown that high-quality early child care and education has a positive impact on language development at as early as 2 years old, with higher-quality care predicting better language performance at age 4.10 Evidence suggests that children living in poverty may hear 30 million fewer words by age 3, leading to lasting implications on children’s development, so quality early learning experiences that foster language acquisition are also important to support young children’s lifelong development. Further, data show that language ability prior to school entry was highest among children who had high-quality early care during both the infant-toddler and preschool periods, and lowest among children who did not have access to high-quality child care during either of these periods.11 Early childhood serves as a unique opportunity to foster healthy social-emotional development, supporting young children’s ability to manage their emotions, express strong feelings in a productive way, regulate their behavior,&hellip;",

    "content": "In 2018, the most recent annual data available, about 1.3 million children received a child care subsidy through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG).1 To receive a subsidy, federal statute has broad eligibility requirements: a child must be under age 13 and live within a household making at or below 85% of their state median income. States are also required to prioritize low-income children, children with special needs, and children experiencing homelessness, but are provided latitude on how to define and best serve these populations. Despite these efforts to provide the most at-risk children and families with a child care subsidy, inconsistent policies on eligibility combined with limited funding can result in inequitable distribution of CCDBG dollars. Consequently, it is difficult to measure if states are achieving those federally mandated goals or determine if some eligible children who might benefit from a subsidy most are being overlooked. Though federal statute requires families to live within a household making at or below 85% of their state median income to qualify for CCDBG, states have flexibility to establish more restrictive eligibility criteria. For example, from 2016 to 2017, a monthly average of 13.5 million children under age 13 were eligible for CCDBG under federal statute, whereas only 8.7 million were eligible under their state policies. Of those 8.7 million, less than 22% (1.9 million children) received a subsidy, translating to only 14% of all federally eligible children receiving a subsidy.2 However, per the statutory directive to prioritize low-income families and children, very low-income children are highly representative recipients of CCDBG subsidies, and this trend holds true for most states. From 2011 to 2012, 60% of subsidy recipients fell at or below 100% of the poverty line and represented 45.6% of all eligible children.3 The trend continued to hold true in 2017, when 46% of 4-year-old children with family incomes below the federal poverty line received subsidies, compared to 16% of children with family incomes between 150% and 199% of the federal poverty line.4 Single-parent households tend to have lower incomes and, consequently, almost 85% of recipient children from 2011 to 2012 lived in single-parent households.5 Despite the relative success in providing subsidies to low-income, single-parent households, many children and families who are eligible based on their low incomes are excluded due to a combination of limited funding, restricted state eligibility, and inadequate supply of child care slots. Though children up to age 13 may be eligible, and children aged 5 to 12 are a majority of those eligible, children younger than age 4 receive the majority of CCDBG funds. In general, children between the ages of 2 to 4 are largely overrepresented in their receipt of subsidies. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 21.6% of the U.S. population speak a language other than English at home.6 Some states report providing CCDBG subsidies to children whose primary language at home is Spanish and from 2011-2012, Hispanic children made up 35% of all eligible children nationwide.7;8 Despite this, Hispanic children are largely underrepresented&hellip;",

Data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows that the final fiscal year 2020 border apprehensions were significantly lower than those in FY2018 and FY2019, indicating that the Trump administration’s policies limiting asylum access at the border and the COVID-19 pandemic made migrants–especially families and children–wary of traveling to the United States. However, CBP data also shows the Title 42 program began to expel significantly more single adults, a group that likely includes a larger percentage of Mexican nationals. Although the Trump administration introduced the Title 42 program to deter the arrival of migrants seeking asylum, these trends strongly suggest that migration to the U.S.-Mexico has reverted back to past historic patterns when large numbers of single Mexican men attempted to enter the country at the U.S.-Mexico border. As Figure 1 shows, CBP recorded 400,651 encounters at the southwest border during FY2020, which includes both apprehensions and Title 42 expulsions.1 CBP recorded 203,608 apprehensions, a marked drop from the 851,508 apprehensions recorded in FY2019 Central American families arrived in large numbers. The FY2020 levels were also lower than those seen in FY2017, which marked the lowest number of recorded apprehensions since the 1970s. Although apprehensions dropped, the Department of Homeland Security began using Title 42 expulsions in March 2020 as an alternative to apprehensions. In FY2020, DHS recorded 197,043 expulsions, which formed almost half of all encounters. Source: CBP (1)(2)(3) Monthly apprehensions during FY2020 dropped significantly from the levels seen in FY2019. CBP apprehended 1,549 migrants in May 2020, a 98.43% decrease from May 2019 when the agency apprehended 132,956 individuals. The last time border enforcement actions in a single month came close to these monthly levels was April 2017, which at the time marked the lowest monthly apprehensions that CBP recorded since 1999. However, during the same period DHS began recording significantly more expulsions of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. Expulsions increased from 7,081 in March 2020 to 48,327 in September 2020 when it formed 88% of all encounters that month. As a total, however, encounters in FY2020 were approximately the same as in 2018, making the drop in apprehensions mostly a shift in how migrants were processed, and showing that arrivals remained fairly consistent across the last decade, with FY2019 remaining an outlier for the period. Source: CBP (1)(2)(3)  In terms of demographic groups, single adults2 formed a majority of encounters in FY2020 (Figure 3), accounting for 79% in FY2020. Family units were 13% and unaccompanied children were 8% this past year. Despite the overall decreases in encounters of unaccompanied children in FY2020, apprehensions for this group increased between May through September.3 These percentages for the three groups mark a reversal from the trends seen in FY2019, which only included apprehensions. In that year, single adults formed 35% of apprehensions, family units were 56%, and unaccompanied children were 9%. Source: CBP (1)(2)  The FY2020 CBP data&hellip;",

Even though Biden’s current lead is too large for President Trump to overcome with yet-to-be-counted ballots, many states are still working to officially certify election results We have an apparent winner, but to make it official, local and state election officials first have to canvass and certify the results. As such, it’s reasonable to ask how much longer this election will take. The answer is not too long, but it won’t be immediate. When it comes to canvassing and certifying, each state has its own timeline. We explain the processes below with a week-by-week breakdown of the timeline by state. According to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, canvassing refers to “the compilation of election returns and validation of the outcome that forms the basis of the official results by political subdivision.” At the local level, canvassing means compiling the tabulated results from each in-person early voting and/or Election Day polling place, absentee ballots, and provisional ballots. At the state level, the process is the compilation of the local results. Canvassing must be completed by certain deadlines, which can vary from within the week after Election Day, as in Connecticut and Alabama, to no later than a month after Election Day, as in California and West Virginia. After the canvass is completed, results are can be certified. At this stage, the reports compiled by the local jurisdictions are reviewed and double-checked to ensure accuracy. Counties can individually certify results, but all states must have their results certified by the chief election official, which is usually the state director of elections or the secretary of state. Deadlines for certification vary by state in accordance with when they close their canvassing period. State certification deadlines range from two days to over a month after Election Day. Source: National Association of State Election Directors While some media sources may project the winners of races long before these dates, those are just projections. The winner of each state contest is not final until the certification has been completed. For the presidential election, states have a hard deadline of December 14th, when electors of the Electoral College must meet and vote, to certify their results. Finalizing the results was always going to take weeks. The American election system is doing exactly what it was designed for. Every vote is being counted and verified with precision and care, and we trust that election officials will do their jobs.",

    "content": "A record-breaking 64 million Americans cast their ballot by mail this year. Mail voting has been around in some form since the Civil War, but this election is many Americans’ first introduction. Accordingly, hearing stories about some mail ballots being discarded for signature mismatches or other voter errors might be disconcerting. Thankfully, many states have a little-known procedure—called ballot curing—in place that allows eligible voters to fix problems on their mail ballot and make sure their voice is heard. The majority of states rely on a process called signature verification to confirm the identity of mail voters. Voters in these states are required to sign their outer ballot envelope to establish their eligibility. Election officials then compare that signature to the voter’s signature on file, which is collected either during voter registration or some other transaction with the state. If a voter’s signature is missing on the outer ballot envelope, or if it does not match their signature on file, the ballot can be rejected because the voter’s eligibility cannot be confirmed. To make sure all eligible voters have their voices heard, many states rely on ballot curing to give voters a chance to fix—or “cure”—problems on their ballot envelope before their ballot is discarded. Importantly, voters aren’t changing their choices on the ballot itself. In many states that allow ballot curing, election officials contact the voter directly by email, phone, or in some cases by mail if a ballot needs a cure. Turnaround times are short, and voters must provide alternative information or a new signature to verify their ballot’s eligibility. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, only 18 states have standing laws that require election officials to contact voters if their mail ballot has an error, but more have implemented ballot curing on a temporary basis for the 2020 presidential election. Other states without statutory provisions in place also perform ballot curing at the local level at the discretion of election officials. States vary widely on what disqualifying issues can and cannot be cured, and local election officials often decide themselves on how to implement curing requirements with minimal state guidance. In some states, voters can cure ballots that have either a mismatching or missing signature; in others, voters can only fix ballots with a mismatching—but not missing—signature. In select states that require witness signatures on absentee ballots, voters can cure misplaced or missing witness signatures in addition to their own. Additional disqualifying issues that voters can cure in some areas include missing Social Security numbers, unsealed envelopes that meet certain requirements, and problems with ballot statements. In addition to state by state variation in what is covered under ballot curing procedures, deadlines for how quickly officials must contact voters, as well as for how long and in what ways voters can prove their eligibility, vary by state and locality. The inconsistent use of ballot curing within states is already facing legal pushback this election season. On November 3, Republican litigants filed a lawsuit against Montgomery&hellip;",

    "content": "The United States’ immigration system has required immigrants to pay user fees to recover costs for the services related to immigration inspection or admission since at least 1903. Currently, the agency responsible for processing applications and petitions for immigration benefits and citizenship, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services within the Department of Homeland Security, is funded entirely by application and petition fees that account for around 97% of the USCIS budget each year. Due to its dependency on user fees, the employer sponsorship petition model used to hire foreign workers can be expensive for employers and foreign employees alike. DHS has implemented three scheduled fee changes since 2010, which have significantly increased the costs of employment-based visa sponsorship. DHS’ argument for each fee change has consistently been to recover its costs for adjudicating these applications. However, some charge that the fee-recovery model in fact incentivizes the agency to delay applications and require additional filings, which begs the question of whether another mechanism may be possible. In this post, we will consider the Canadian fee system, which is based on a self-sponsorship model and has significantly lower costs for an employment-based visa, may be helpful. But first, we’ll look at how user fees have developed over time in the U.S. model. Congress passed the Department of Justice Appropriations Act of 1989 which helped establish the Immigration Examination Fee Account; making user fees a mandatory part of the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service’s budget and no longer subject to congressional approval. Current application fees, such as the ones used to petition for a nonimmigrant worker, employment authorization, and other applications associated with immigration adjudication were established by INS in 1991 based on estimated costs to process the application. INS relied on the “user fee statute,” which provides authority for a government agency to set charges for a service to stay self-sustainable to the greatest possible extent. The rule also gives authority to the head of the agency to establish charges for a service or thing of value. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which took over the immigration adjudication and processing responsibilities from INS while retaining the “user fee model.”1 USCIS inherited the IEFA when INS was abolished. Since then, USCIS has also been dependent on user fee accounts to support all its immigration adjudication and processing operations. USCIS’ user fee structure model, just like its predecessor, has continued to ensure that the fees for adjudication and processing would recover the full costs of providing immigration and naturalization services, including recoupment of fees for similar services to those people who are unable to pay, such as asylum applicants. Additionally, user fees are also set to cover administration costs related to fee collection. Petitioning for foreign workers to obtain temporary and permanent employment in the United States is an expensive process, both for employers and employees. In June 2020, after announcing a budget shortfall, USCIS increased its fees for a range of&hellip;",

    "content": "After months of trepidation, excitement, anticipation, and—let’s face it—loathing, Election Day is finally upon us. Voting ends today, but the full counting process will take weeks. You should keep calm, and let the counting carry on. More than 150 million ballots will be cast in the 2020 presidential election, which would make this one of the highest turnout elections in decades. That’s during a time of destabilizing political polarization and a once-in-a-generation pandemic. While the process has rapidly evolved to meet voters’ needs, we should all expect that every valid, eligible ballot is accurately counted no matter how long it takes. Mail ballots take longer to verify and prepare for tabulation than ballots cast in person. In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—two key swing states this cycle—election officials didn’t start processing mail ballots until 7 a.m. today, yet they will be dealing with far more mail ballots than in the past. Look at the numbers: In 2016, about 250,000 Pennsylvanians cast mail ballots; in 2020, about 2.5 million cast a mail ballot. In Wisconsin that year, 850,000 absentee ballots were cast; this year, that figure is approaching 2 million. A longer period between the close of polls and the reporting of results does not indicate that something is wrong. Rather, it means that election officials are taking the time they need to produce a fair and accurate vote count while, as is the case in Pennsylvania, coping with a 10-fold increase in mail ballots. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are a stark contrast to their swing state sibling, Florida, where absentee ballot processing began 40 days ago. In 2016, 9.6 million Floridians in total turned out to vote. This year, nearly 9 million Floridians voted before Election Day even began. The state will release unofficial results tonight that include almost all ballots cast prior to Election Day. The results which also include much of the in-person voting totals, will represent a huge proportion of all ballots cast. This variation among states is a natural consequence of the United States’ decentralized voting system. While news stories pour in as polling places close, keep in mind that initial results will continue to tally as more ballots are counted. Always check with your state and local election officials as your primary source of trusted elections information. Voting ends today but this election season isn’t over yet. As votes are counted and tensions rise in the coming days, keep a level head, know that results will take time, and always seek out trusted information to put what you hear in context. And, most importantly, remember to keep calm and let the counting carry on.",

Elections Websites are Separate from Vote Counts Public facing websites will be updated with unofficial results as ballots are counted on Election Day and in the days that follow. They are not connected to any voting or tabulation equipment, so infiltrating a public government website does not impact the vote tallying process. If a website is down, either because of a cyberattack or technological malfunction, the public may not be able to access results for a short time, but voting systems and voting data are still secure. Election Officials and Cybersecurity Agencies are Prepared In recent years, elections officials have been hard at work with our nation’s leading law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies to secure and strengthen elections infrastructure. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of American elections makes any coordinated, widespread cyberattack virtually impossible. In the event that a website goes down, election officials have back-up communication channels with the public—including through news and social media outlets—about where and when official results will be available. Public Responsibility There is no evidence that malicious actors have or will be able to change vote tallies this year.

With the COVID-19 pandemic leaving the finances of many households in a rather perilous state, this series took an in-depth look at topics that are on many American’s minds, including unemployment insurance and economic stimulus, tax policy, student loan debt, and retirement security. With the public health and economic outlook highly uncertain, an increasing number of small businesses are at risk of shutting down for good and job losses that were once believed to be temporary are becoming permanent. Yet efforts have stalled on Capitol Hill to provide additional relief to struggling families and businesses, damaging the economic recovery. Featuring BPC President Jason Grumet, Yahoo Finance’s Kristin Myers, Wildfire Executive Director Cynthia Swick, University of Michigan economist Betsey Stevenson, and National Taxpayers Union Senior Fellow Mattie Duppler, this conversation focuses on the disagreements at the heart of the debate, including unemployment insurance, child care, and support for small businesses. As families and businesses continue to struggle, the American economy is at an inflection point. BPC believes it is crucial in this moment for policymakers to come together around further fiscal support. Accordingly, we have put forward various approaches on unemployment insurance, paid leave, and childcare that could meet both parties’ goals, forming the core of an additional relief package, and help support a needed economic recovery. How to Solve Several UI Challenges at Once The Need for Paid Leave Amidst Historic Unemployment and Caregiving Responsibilities Child Care in COVID-19: Another Look at What Parents Want The shape and scope of the tax code will be a contested component of U.S. economic policy over the next four years. What should Americans expect from tax policy in the next Congress and administration, depending on the outcome of the election? Is there any opportunity for bipartisanship going forward? In this segment, BPC’s Ben Gitis welcomes Yahoo Finance’s Rick Newman, American Action Forum President and former Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Holtz-Eakin, and Harvard economist and former Council of Economic Advisers Chair Jason Furman to discuss the two parties’ tax policy priorities. At BPC, we are focusing on key tax policy areas with the potential for durable progress, like the working family tax credits. Over the coming months, we will be putting forward policies that pave the way for bipartisan action. We’ll also discuss these tax credits and other important issues at BPC’s virtual Solutions Summit in December. Background on the EITC The economic fallout from COVID-19 has amplified the financial burden of student debt, which is the second highest consumer debt category—behind only mortgages—with 43 million borrowers collectively owing more than $1.5 trillion.

    "content": "With a record number of voters set to cast their ballots by mail in this year’s election, concern is growing that unintentional voter errors on absentee ballot envelopes may result in the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of voters. Thirty-one states use signature verification to confirm the identity of mail voters. Voters in those states are required to sign the outer ballot envelope to establish eligibility. Election officials then compare that signature to a voter’s signature on file, which was obtained during registration, at the DMV, or from an absentee ballot application. If a voter’s signature is missing, or if it doesn’t match their signature on file, the ballot is rejected because the voter’s eligibility cannot be confirmed. It doesn’t have to be this way. Many states now have systems in place to notify voters if their ballot is at risk and offer them the opportunity to “cure,” or fix, the disqualifying issues by submitting additional information. Ballot curing does not change anything on the ballot itself; it allows a voter to prove their eligibility to an election official. Without ballot curing, voter error can effectively result in disenfranchisement. BPC’s Task Force on Elections recommends that all states establish systems for notifying voters about verification issues with their ballots and offering them the opportunity to fix those problems. According to the Election Assistance Commission, non-matching or missing signatures are among the most common reasons why mail-in ballots are rejected. In a normal election, hundreds or even thousands of ballots can be discarded over issues that could have been resolved if the proper curing procedures had been in place. This is not a normal election. While 24% of ballots in 2016 were cast absentee, BPC estimates that absentee votes will comprise more than 50% of the national vote totals for the 2020 general election. Record numbers of mail-in ballots—including a significant number from first time absentee voters, who are more prone to make mistakes when filling out mail-in ballots—will almost certainly mean that a record number of ballots could be at-risk for rejection due to voter verification issues. We are already seeing ominous ballot rejection issues in the general election. South Carolina and Wisconsin have already rejected more than 1,500 ballots each due to voter verification issues. When all is said and done, it’s entirely possible that hundreds of thousands of votes in this election will be disqualified because of “voter errors.” Additionally, there are significant racial disparities in the rates at which absentee ballots are rejected. Right now in North Carolina, ballots cast by Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American voters are being rejected at 3-5 times the rate of those cast by white voters. And although the specific rates vary between jurisdictions, similar trends in past elections have been documented in a number of other states. The reasons for these disparities are yet unclear; however, their reality—and their undemocratic and disenfranchising implications—are not. Some states anticipated the verification issues in this election and made the necessary policy changes. Ahead&hellip;",

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Farm and Forest Natural Carbon Solutions Initiative focuses on policies that support a low-carbon future by strategically using the inherent abilities of forests and soils to remove and store carbon from the atmosphere. While much of the policy focus to date has been on the extensive forests, agricultural lands, and grasslands of rural America, there is also a role for urban forests and tree planting in our nation’s efforts to sequester carbon. Although most U.S. counties are rural, 84% of Americans live in urban areas. From 1950 to 2018, the amount of the U.S. population living in an urban area increased by 20%, and it is projected to keep increasing through 2050. With a growing urban population, the U.S. has an opportunity to make win-win decisions by sequestering carbon and bringing the many other co-benefits of tree planting to a broad cross-section of Americans. These benefits include improving community health outcomes, lowering electricity and utility bills, and fostering economic growth and development, which are especially important given the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Trees naturally remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change. Reforestation—regrowing forest on land which was once forested—has the largest estimated carbon removal potential among forest management actions (up to 307 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year). Historically, 25% of the world’s carbon emissions have been captured through forests, farms, and grasslands, but expanding urban tree planting by 7-11% (or 8 million acres) can capture up to 2.27 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year that would have otherwise remained in the atmosphere. Urban reforestation and the protection and management of existing urban forests may not have the acreage potential that rural areas hold, but urban trees still reduce the carbon in our atmosphere, and still help mitigate the negative effects of climate change in our communities. Urban forests and increased tree cover are a key strategy for cities and towns to protect against the adverse impacts of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, especially those associated with extreme heat and heat waves. The UHI effect results from the fact that urban areas have more human-made structures and impervious surfaces–such as roofs, sidewalks, roads, buildings, and parking lots–and less natural vegetation and greenspace compared to the geography around them. Urban design and building materials (often concrete and asphalt) change the way that cities reflect, absorb, and re-emit solar energy, and their patterns of airflow and water evaporation that provide natural cooling. Collectively, this results in daytime urban temperatures that are on average about 1-7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than outlying areas. Figure 1 below shows the UHI effect on temperatures in urban areas compared to rural and suburban areas, and higher density cities will experience the biggest temperature difference. Although a few degrees may not sound like a lot, the UHI effect is very damaging to community health, especially in the summer when it is at its most intense. Increased temperature exposes city-dwellers&hellip;",

The September monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics found that, among people over 20, four times more women than men left employment. Specifically, 865,000 women dropped out of the U.S. workforce, while 216,000 men did the same. BPC designed this survey to better understand what is driving this discouraging gender disparity. Among Americans who left their work, our survey found that: Women with children are much more likely to have left work. Among women with children under 2 years old, 42% have left work during the coronavirus pandemic. Two in five (41%) adults either are women who have left work or know a woman that has left the workforce during the pandemic. Women are twice as likely as men to say they left work for caregiving responsibilities due to childcare provider or school closures “Women are leaving work at an unprecedented rate and it’s important to understand why. As Congress continues to consider COVID-19 relief packages, policymakers should design policies that not only create new employment opportunities, but empowers women to actually take those jobs,” says Adrienne Schweer, a BPC fellow leading paid family leave efforts. “This survey shows that caregiving is a significant challenge to employment, especially for parents. Pragmatic policies that support the caregiver—like paid family leave—are needed to better manage family responsibilities while staying connected to the workforce.” The Bipartisan Policy Center has called on Congress to consider extending and expanding the emergency paid family leave program enacted early in the pandemic, as it covers as few as 25% of American workers and is proven to both reduce COVID-19 cases by 400 per day per state and keep families connected to work.",

    "content": "Millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. And while the voting looks different than anyone could have envisioned in January, the rollout of more vote by mail and early voting has been relatively smooth. But it could be better. Voters across the country have expanded options due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Combined with high voter enthusiasm, there has already been a record number of Americans voting prior to Election Day with at least 66.6 million people having already voted as of the afternoon of October 27 according to the U.S. Elections Project. States that have already begun early voting are reporting turnout rates that far exceed that of previous elections. In battleground states like Michigan, for example, over 1.6 million voters have already cast their ballots, exceeding the total 1.1 million early votes cast during the 2016 election. In Texas, which currently leads the country in the number of early votes cast, 7.8 million people have already voted, exceeding the 2016 early vote total of 4.5 million by 73%. Meanwhile, enthusiasm at the outset of early voting has broken records. Georgia’s first day of early voting saw 128,590 votes cast, 42% higher than the number of votes cast on the first day of early voting in 2016. Florida&#8217;s first day of early voting also saw record turnout, with more 350,000 ballots cast—in one day representing more than 50% of Florida’s total early voter turnout in 2016. This high volume of votes, however, has also fostered administrative issues, from technology problems to long lines. In response, state and local election officials across the country have taken steps to mitigate and respond to these challenges: In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has encouraged county election officials to add additional voting machines and polling locations to reduce wait times after the first few days of early voting saw long lines at many voting sites. Cobb and Gwinnett counties have since placed additional voting machines and check-in stations, while Henry County has decided to open four additional voting locations. In Fort Bend County, TX, voting machines were down for an hour at four polling locations on the first day of early voting due to technical glitches. In response, the county commissioners court extended early voting hours for the rest of the week, and promised to update all voting machines to prevent future technological problems. In Allegheny County, PA, the company responsible for printing and mailing ballots sent about 29,000 voters the wrong ballot. The mistake was caught in time, and county officials created a search function on its website that allowed voters to check if their ballots were among those affected and request a new ballot if they were. While these types of administrative errors occur every election, the increased traffic of early votes has exacerbated them. While record early voter turnout has exacerbated administrative errors during the first weeks of early voting, states and local jurisdictions can learn from these experiences.

Texas, a case that calls into question the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and puts millions of Americans at risk of losing access to affordable health insurance options. Oral arguments for the case are scheduled to begin on November 10, one week after the election. The case, which was brought by a group of red states and has been supported by the Trump administration, questions whether the ACA may still stand without the individual mandate penalty, which was set to zero in 2019 after Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. Many experts believe the legal argument in the case is weak, but the Court’s new 6-3 conservative majority makes the future of the ACA less certain. The Court’s decision is expected to rely heavily on the question of “severability,” the notion that if part of a law is determined unconstitutional, some or all of the remaining statute may stand based on congressional intent. If the individual mandate penalty is found to be unconstitutional, the court must determine how much of the ACA may remain in place. The severability doctrine has strong legal precedence and has played a key role in many Supreme Court decisions, including two cases heard earlier this year, suggesting the decision will not be all or nothing and at least some of the ACA will be saved. The Supreme Court may decide the fate of the country’s most comprehensive health reform bill in recent history amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs and employer-sponsored health insurance. If the Supreme Court overturns the entire ACA, millions who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance may be left without options for affordable coverage unless policymakers act. While we have seen health care coverage proposals from the Biden campaign and the Trump administration, including a recent executive order to continue protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, there continues to be little bipartisan consensus on a path forward without the ACA. Middle-income individuals: 12 million The ACA’s Marketplaces extended access to health insurance to millions of middle-income Americans, creating coverage options for those without employer-sponsored insurance who do not qualify for either Medicare or Medicaid. Individuals with incomes between 100-400% of the Federal Poverty Level ($1,063 &#8211; $4,253 per month for an individual in 2020) are eligible for premium tax credits, which are based on a sliding scale to help make these plans more affordable. However, Marketplace plans remain unaffordable for many whose incomes are above the threshold for subsidized coverage – a major criticism of the ACA. In January 2020, overall Marketplace enrollment across the country was 11.4 million, and 9.6 million received subsidized coverage. The&hellip;",

    "content": "COVID-19 has dramatically increased public health costs, and the pandemic’s economic fallout has depressed tax revenues. Under increased financial pressure during recessions, states—nearly all of which face balanced budget requirements—have to make tough tradeoffs, which is why funding for higher education tends to get squeezed. These cuts are often shouldered by students and families, as institutions raise tuition to fill their budget gaps. This pattern has repeated several times over the past 25 years, underscoring the need for a policy solution to mitigate state disinvestment. The unique nature of the current crisis has added urgency to the mix. State higher education funding is often the first spending category to be cut during recessions. Other state priorities—including K-12 education and Medicaid—have ballooned since the mid-1980s, forcing states to find other areas to reduce spending. Recessions exacerbate this trend, as tax revenues fall and states are forced to make choices between competing priorities, increasing the challenge of maintaining consistent funding. This relationship between economic conditions and state funding for higher education yields a pattern that mirrors the business cycle, rising during upturns and falling during recessions. Per-student funding over the past quarter-century has ranged from a high of $8,803 just prior to the 2001 recession to a low of $6,026 following the Great Recession, on an inflation-adjusted basis (Figure 1). Note: State support per full-time equivalent student excludes American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and appropriations for research, agriculture, and medical operations.   Source: Author calculations of State Higher Education Executive Officers, State Higher Education Finance: FY 2019, 2020.  Higher education institutions often use tuition revenue as a crutch during economic downturns, passing funding gaps onto students through tuition hikes. Without tuition hikes, institutions would struggle to maintain consistent per-student resources during recessions. This is because the demand for a college education tends to increase following a recession at the same time state support declines, with individuals seeking to develop their skills in a tough labor market. Easy access to credit through the federal student loan system enables this dynamic; students and families can take on additional debt to meet rising tuition prices. Faced with increased costs and greater debt burdens, students ultimately bear the brunt of state budget cuts. The evidence is clear: Between 2008 and 2012, enrollment at public institutions rose by 11.5%, with the recessions in 1990 and 2001 generating a similar pattern (Figure 2). During the Great Recession, the share of education revenues paid by students rose from 36% in 2008 to 47% in 2012. To put this in terms of cost to students: average public four-year in-state tuition and fees increased by 23% over this same period—from $7,620 to $9,400 in constant 2019 dollars. Note: Public enrollment measures the net full-time equivalent enrollment at public institutions.  Source: Author calculations of State Higher Education Executive Officers, State Higher Education Finance: FY 2019, 2020.  Higher education funding challenges have worsened over the past three recessions. Following the 1990 downturn, state funding for higher education fell by 12% on a per-student basis. During the 2001 recession,&hellip;",

Forty-three states and the District of Columbia permit candidates or citizens to petition for a recount, but in most of these states, the petitioner is responsible for much of the expense of conducting the recount, unless the recount reverses the result of the election. Currently, automatic recount margins across the U.S. vary between 0% (tie) and 1% of all votes cast. The median recount threshold is 0.5% of all votes cast. BPC’s Task Force on Elections recommends that all states provide for a government-funded automatic recount that takes account of the margin between candidates and the number of votes cast.

Elections in the United States are administered by more than 8,000 local officials implementing federal and state laws, and Americans have a lot of options for how they register and how they vote. Isolated issues are expected in any large election, but they reflect only a small portion of the tens of thousands of total voting locations. Election officials are prepared for administrative challenges. Administrative challenges like technological glitches and ballot printing errors are not new. That’s why election officials test their technology repeatedly before voting begins, prepare backup plans in the event something goes wrong, and audit the election to verify the count is accurate after the fact. It’s important to remember that single incidents faced by a small number of election jurisdictions make up only a small portion of the thousands of jurisdictions around the country. Any operation this large can be expected to run into a handful of problems. However, election officials have been hard at work in the runup to the election preparing for any problems that might arise. Specific incidents are typically identified quickly and resolved, and they do not indicate a widespread problem with the election ecosystem. Isolated incidents don&#8217;t mean it is unsafe to vote. You should view reports of violence or disruption at any one individual polling place in context. The U.S. voting process is decentralized, which means that local and state officials are responsible for their own polling places. A problem in one state is not likely to affect another state’s polling places. There were at least 178,000 individual polling places on Election Day and at least 8,500 early in-person voting sites across the United States during the 2016 presidential election. While media reports and social media posts tend to highlight the most extreme issues that arise during voting, voters must remain vigilant and should not assume similar problems everywhere.

    "content": "Compared with previous elections, increases in mail voting and provisional ballots might mean we have to wait longer to know the final results. Americans are voting by mail in record numbers this year due to the pandemic. In 2016, roughly 23.6% of ballots were cast through the mail. In 2020, it’s possible that the rate of mail voting could reach 50% or higher. Absentee voting and vote by mail are safe and reliable voting methods that date back to as early as the Civil War. Counting mail ballots takes additional time and resources. While the eligibility of in-person voters can be verified at the polls and their ballots can be counted in real time, mail ballots require additional layers of processing, verification, and tabulation that are both time and resource intensive. The handful of states that have been voting entirely or mostly by mail for years—like Oregon, Colorado, and Washington—have automated and streamlined the ballot verification and counting process. However, many states and localities this year have had to rapidly expand their vote by mail operations in order to keep voters and poll workers safe. And while automation can help speed up the process, it requires expensive machinery that most states have neither the money to purchase on a short timeline nor the need for under normal circumstances. States that don’t allow the preprocessing of absentee ballots or lack the necessary tools for automation will see delays in the reporting of unofficial results as absentee ballots are verified and counted in the days following Election Day. In addition, we are expecting to see an increase in provisional ballots cast this year, which are typically counted last, after mail-in ballots. Provisional ballots provide a backup option for voters whose eligibility is uncertain when they arrive at the polls. Provisional ballots help ensure all eligible voters can vote by allowing election officials to verify eligibility after the fact. Because of these additional steps, processing provisional ballots takes time. The additional time required to process absentee and provisional ballots this year may result in a gap between Election Day and the determination of a winner. Importantly, this gap does not indicate widespread fraud or administrative failure. Rather, it reflects a vote-counting process that is thorough, secure, and responsive to shifting voter needs in this challenging time.",

The federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 established minimum standards of election administration—such as for provisional ballots and voting systems—while leaving control of almost all decisions in the hands of state and local authorities. Rules, policies, and procedures vary greatly across, and even within, state lines. For example, the process known as ballot harvesting—the nongovernmental collection of ballots by one person or entity on behalf of individual voters—is legal in 26 states. Furthermore, in 20 states election officials contact voters to give them an opportunity to remedy issues on their ballot return envelope that would otherwise result in the ballot being rejected. This process, often known as ballot or signature curing, helps to ensure that all eligible ballots are counted. Practices such as ballot harvesting and signature curing might sound concerning without proper context, even though these processes are entirely legal in some states.

If you choose to vote in person, poll workers will know if you’ve already been sent a mail ballot. However, in most cases it’s not possible for a poll worker to confirm if a vote by mail ballot you sent back was received by the election office. If you requested a mail ballot and show up at a polling place on Election Day, in many states you’ll be asked to complete a provisional ballot, unless you bring your ballot with you and surrender it at the polling place. Provisional Ballots Provisional ballots provide a federally mandated failsafe for voters that show up on Election Day to vote but encounter problems with their eligibility, such as arriving at the wrong precinct or already having applied for an absentee ballot. Provisional ballots are typically counted last, after a voter’s eligibility has been confirmed. Provisional ballots usually account for a small proportion of ballots cast on Election Day. It is likely, however, that the number of provisional ballots will increase this year as a result of polling place closures and consolidations, as well as voters who already requested an absentee ballot showing up at the polls. Processing provisional ballots can be even more onerous than absentee ballots. Prior to the customary steps for verifying a voter’s signature, election officials must review the voter’s eligibility on voter rolls as well as whether they have requested and cast a mail-in ballot. Election officials may have to contact the voter for additional information or identification before making a determination of whether to count a provisional ballot. That is why you may see on your voter registration form or absentee ballot request form an optional spot to include your email address or cell phone number. This information can be vital for election officials reaching out to you on tight deadlines. Check with your election officials if you have concerns Provisional ballots are an essential feature of our elections ecosystem, but they are intended to be back-up option in case of error or unexpected events. If too many voters go to the polls after already requesting an absentee ballot, the additional time involved in casting a provisional ballot will weigh down already overwhelmed polling places and lead to increased wait times and line lengths. If you have concerns about your mail ballot, you can check to see if your state has ballot tracking options available or contact your local election official for more information.

    "content": "Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Social Security’s finances were unsustainable. For years, demographic and economic trends—especially an aging population—have been raising the program’s costs and depressing its revenue. As Baby Boomers are set to retire, this financial challenge was expected to grow more dire with each passing year. Then the pandemic hit. And with it came a severe recession that will exact a further toll on Social Security’s finances. But how seriously will the current recession affect the program? How much sooner will reserves in its two trust funds become depleted? The answers to those questions are particularly important because they may ultimately drive the politics around addressing the program’s finances. Social Security has a retirement program (Old-Age and Survivor Insurance, or OASI) and a disability program (Disability Insurance, or DI), each with its own trust fund. A recession damages the finances of both. Most of the money Social Security pays out in benefits comes from payroll taxes. A laid-off worker doesn’t pay payroll taxes, nor does the employer share of the former worker’s payroll taxes get paid. Since February, the United States has, on net, lost 10.7 million jobs. That means 10.7 million fewer workers paying into Social Security. Even among workers who have kept their jobs, many have faced cuts in hours or wages, and a slack labor market will slow wage growth, further depressing payroll tax revenue. Social Security has two other, smaller revenue sources, which are also threatened by a recession. Beneficiaries pay taxes on their benefits if their income exceeds certain thresholds. A deep recession results in fewer beneficiaries meeting these thresholds, meaning their benefits won’t be taxed. Finally, the trust funds hold U.S. Treasury securities that earn interest. The Federal Reserve generally responds to recessions (as it has with this one) by cutting interest rates, which will lower the yields on those bonds. Because these effects reduce revenue flowing into the trust funds, they make the trust funds smaller than otherwise, further reducing their interest income. Recessions also raise Social Security’s costs. When the labor market is weak, more people claim disability insurance. Meanwhile, a wave of laid-off older workers may be forced to retire—and claim benefits—earlier than they had planned, raising costs to the program in the short term. Recent history shows how dramatically a recession’s combination of lower revenue and higher costs can accelerate the depletion of Social Security’s trust fund reserves. At the start of 2008—before it was clear that the United States had plunged into a recession—Social Security’s Trustees projected that the combined reserves of the retirement and disability (OASDI) trust funds would be depleted in 2041. In 2012, after several years of a dismal labor market and sluggish economic growth, that projected date had moved up to 2033. The current recession will likewise cause trust fund reserves to be depleted sooner than anticipated. How much sooner will depend on the recession’s depth and duration, as well as the rate of post-recession economic growth. Rather than trying to predict the&hellip;",

    "content": "“Child Care is a tough business in normal times.” This insight was shared by Rep. Andy Kim (D-NJ) at the closure of the House Committee on Small Business’ latest hearing to review the loan forgiveness component of the Paycheck Protection Program. This program has been crucial for many child care providers, the majority of which are small businesses, who have faced months of uncertainty about the future of their business. Now, as recipients enter the forgiveness period, additional uncertainty and complications must be addressed in order to fully support these businesses through the remainder of the pandemic. According to an August survey of parents by the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult, 70% of child care businesses are still closed or operating under reduced capacity or limited hours due to current COVID-19 concerns. Those that have reopened or stayed open must absorb new and increased operating costs to meet health and safety requirements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while the lower capacity, operating hours, and attendance reduce their budgets. The child care business model is a precarious one in healthy economic times, and margins have only gotten thinner during the pandemic. The PPP was established in the CARES Act to help small businesses meet payroll costs and other fixed expenses such as utilities and rent while the coronavirus pandemic kept their doors closed through no fault of their own. The program officially stopped accepting applications on August 8 with $134 billion left out of the $659 billion total funding that was appropriated to the program. The PPP was a lifeline for the child care providers who were able to access the program, along with the supplemental CCDBG funding provided in the CARES Act. BPC spoke with Deidre Anderson, executive director of the United Inner City Services St. Mark Child and Family Development Center in Kansas City, Missouri, whose program received both PPP and CCDBG funding as well as funding from private donors which allowed her organization to stay open and survive the challenges of the pandemic. Anderson stated that without that variety of supplemental funding, “we would have been on our own and doomed.” She expressed significant concern that the federal funds would dwindle this fall and that child care businesses would not survive without additional and ongoing support. Unfortunately, however, due to the complicated nature of the loan application process, Anderson was one of the few providers able to receive PPP loans. As BPC reported in July, l6% of the over 670,000 child care businesses in operation prior to the pandemic received a PPP loan, which represented less than 5% of total funds loaned through the program. This is shockingly low participation for such an important industry: As of October, 72 percent of small businesses reported receiving PPP assistance, according to the Census Bureau’s Small Business Pulse Survey. Cassandra Brooks, owner of the Little Believers Academy in Clayton, North Carolina, spoke with BPC about her difficult application experience. Brooks did not initially receive a loan, despite&hellip;",

    "content": "In their final face-to-face meeting before Election Day, President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will take the stage at Belmont University in Nashville, TN, tonight. With less than two weeks until the first election returns start trickling in, we asked three Bipartisan Policy Center experts what issues and questions they hope to hear the candidates address from the debate stage. Here’s what our experts are watching for: COVID-19 cases are rising across the United States, with approximately 60,000 new cases and nearly 1,000 deaths daily. Hospitalizations are increasing in many states, particularly in the Upper Midwest. Positivity rates across the country are also still much too high, an indicator that we are not testing enough to meet the spread of the virus. Personal responsibility (mask use, physical distancing, hand washing, and so on) is necessary, but insufficient; it must be paired with mitigation measures such as limiting indoor gatherings and restricting the capacity of indoor high-risk establishments. That’s the only way we avoid the lockdowns which were imposed in the spring. Congress needs to also come together and pass a short-term relief bill which supports the public health response and addresses the social and economic consequences of the pandemic. I want to hear the candidates tackle five key questions: What needs to be done from now until Election Day—and then beyond—to stem the course of the pandemic? Would you ask all governors to issue and enforce a mask mandate? Would you support additional restrictions if public health experts recommend doing so in the winter? How important do you think testing is to curbing the pandemic and are we doing enough? What do you think about FDA’s COVID-19 vaccine approval process? COVID-19 and its economic fallout have caused severe hardship for millions of households across the country. Aside from controlling the virus, American families are first and foremost in need of additional financial relief. The support passed in the CARES Act this past spring has mostly run out and many more people will struggle if they are forced to make ends meet for much longer. Further enhancements to unemployment insurance and relief from student debt and housing obligations are just some of the urgent needs. Looking ahead, American families need to know that this economic recovery will give everyone the opportunity to succeed and become more financially resilient. Will the candidates consider policies like enhancing tax credits for working families and providing all Americans with easy opportunities and appropriate incentives to save for both emergencies and retirement? One question I want to hear them answer: What would you do to make sure that American families are better financially prepared to meet the next crisis than they were this time around? I’ll be watching (and tweeting @AddisonKStark) the discussion on energy and climate policy closely. In an ideal world, I’d love to see a debate around solutions to stop and reverse climate change, not just rehashing—or refuting—the established scientific consensus that climate change is real. We’re racing against the clock in the effort to address climate change.

    "content": "The United States’ temporary and permanent employment-based visa systems are difficult processes to navigate. The cost of visa sponsorship and the mechanics of cost-sharing between employers and nonimmigrant workers further complicates an already hard process. Simplifying and streamlining the costs of temporary and permanent visa sponsorship may enable America’s small and startup businesses to petition for needed foreign workers under the H-1B and permanent immigration programs, allowing them to sustain their business through human capital and helping them to compete in the global market. Additionally, a streamlined cost for a temporary and permanent visa system might provide foreign workers with higher mobility and decrease the dependence of the workers on their employers for their status, while encouraging employers to maintain good working conditions to incentivize longevity. Petitioning for foreign workers in the H-1B and permanent employment-based visa sponsorship processes can be an expensive. Sponsoring a nonimmigrant employee for the H-1B can cost anywhere between $1,250 to $4,500 in filing fees alone, not including fees paid to attorneys to facilitate the process. Sponsorship for employment-based permanent residency, especially for those who have been previously sponsored by the same employer under the H-1B program, can add more cost to the employer-based visa sponsorship process.1 While the Department of Labor does not administer any fees for labor certification filings, employers do have to face monetary expenses for advertising the position to find U.S. workers and legal fees associated with the process. On top of the filing fees that the employer may have to pay to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, legal fees and other added costs can depend on several factors including the size of the petitioning employer2, whether the employer chooses premium processing,3 a supplementary Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee,4 and any attorney fees associated with the preparation of the filing of the petition. Attorney fees for filing an H-1B petition can be varied and may cost up to $3000 or more. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, hiring foreign workers can cost an employer more than three times more than domestic recruitment. Department of Labor regulations prohibit employers from withholding wages from foreign workers for some costs associated with the preparation and filing of the Labor Condition Application, H-1B petitions, and permanent residency. Additionally, employers are not allowed to garnish wages as a part of rebate or reimbursement from the foreign employee to pay any part of the filing fee, any accrued business expenses, or additional fees associated with their sponsorship petition that would depress the worker’s wage below the required prevailing wage rate. However, the Labor Department does state that additional costs such as premium processing, if requested by the employee, could be borne by the worker. Labor Department regulations also allow employers to recoup some sponsorship fees that are not business expenses and can be paid for by the employee. These types of fees can include translation fees for an employee’s foreign-language documents, legal fees associated with obtaining visas for the employee’s family members, or any other&hellip;",

    "content": "On October 3, 1965 —55 years ago this month—President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Hart-Celler Immigration Amendments Act with the Statute of Liberty as his backdrop. This landmark legislation repealed the race- and nationality-based quota law that had been in place since the 1920s, altering the racial and ethnic composition of the United States. Immigrant admissions from the Americas increased in numbers, and immigrants arriving from Africa and Asia increased both in percentages and numbers after the 1965 act. According to the Pew Research Center, the share of the U.S. population that is foreign born rose from 5% in 1965 to 14% today. The leading architect of immigration reform in the Senate was Sen. Philip Hart (D-MI), who had a strong record on civil rights and labor issues. In 1963, Hart had introduced legislation with bipartisan support that would have abolished the national origins quota system and increased the ceiling on immigration to 250,000. Up to 50,000 visas were set aside for refugees. Immediate relatives of US citizens and immigrants from Western Hemisphere countries would have been unlimited. Prominent Republican senators had signed on as original co-sponsors of Hart’s bill, including Sens. Prescott Bush (CT), Clifford Case (NJ), Hiram Fong (HI), Jacob Javitts (NY), Kenneth Keating (NY) and Hugh Scott (PA). Hart promoted an alternative to the national origin quotas that became known as the per-country caps. His bill stated that not more than 10% of the total number of visas allocated by the preference system could go to any one country. The long-time leader of immigration reform in the House, Rep. Emanuel Celler (D-NY), added comparable provisions to his bill but set the per-country cap at 15 percent of the total. A feature of Hart’s bill that is especially pertinent to today’s immigration reform debate is the provision that would have allowed for immigrants “needed urgently” on account of their “the high education, technical training, specialized experience, or exceptional ability of such immigrant and to be substantially beneficial prospectively to the national economy, cultural interests, or welfare of the United States.” Most significant is that these urgently needed immigrants would have been admitted outside of the preference system and would not have been numerically limited by the per-country caps. That a senator known for his close ties to organized labor would promote high-skilled foreign workers warrants further discussion. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 had included the repeal of the 1885 law that banned foreign workers coming as contract laborers and devoted 50% of immigrant admissions to persons of high education, technical training, specialized experience, and exceptional ability. The 1952 act, however, had numerically limited the admission of high-skilled immigrants to the national origin quotas. Monique Laney’s research discloses that critical applications of technological advancements during World War II prompted a race to recruit foreign scientists. In the early 1960s, the United States was experiencing what was then called a “manpower shortage.” The U.S. economy was humming along with full employment, and the demand for persons with scientific&hellip;",

    "content": "It is the home stretch of a confounding election year. Election officials have devised out of the box solutions time and again to problems they could not have foreseen in March. Michigan’s election officials showed great versatility to adapt to less than ideal circumstances. As a Senior Advisor to Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey, I am involved in the planning process to timely distribute and tabulate 200,000 mail ballots. In mid-March when the COVID-19 nation-wide lockdown began, election officials across the country began gaming out scenarios that defaulted heavily to mail ballots. The theory was simple: If we all needed to be physically distant, a convenience option with minimal person to person touch points could be best. BPC issued a report in mid-May projecting that more than 50% of the votes in November would be cast by mail. This projection about mail ballots has held up as rates of mail-in voting surged during the Michigan’s August primary with 1.6 million Michigan voters cast mail ballots, 300,000 more than the 2016 presidential election. Detroit voters exceeded previous number of mail ballots of 57,000 in 2008 by casting more than 81,000 mail ballots in August. In advance of the primary, the Detroit City Clerk sent mail ballot applications to all the city’s voters resulting in over 100,000 applications being returned. The applications were ‘dual applications’ allowing voters to request a ballot for the primary and a ballot the general election on a single application. The mailing of applications by the city this year has the benefit of not only putting an application in the voters’ hands, but also by using a barcode on the application allowing faster processing when the application is returned. The dual applications have assisted the city clerk in processing and mailing over 100,000 ballots immediately after receiving printed ballots on September 24. By frontloading the application process, we will avoid an overwhelming volume of applications in the last half of October. In Michigan there are no prohibitions on political parties or other groups distributing mail applications to voters. Until this year, voters were responsible for either requesting an application from a municipal clerk or using an application mailed by a third party. As the third-party applications are beginning to be submitted, the clerk is seeing a 10 – 15% duplication rate. Normally, the city clerk has seven satellite offices where voters may register to vote, apply for a mail ballot and return their voted ballot. This year, there are 23 satellite offices, which opened for business on October 5 and are located in city park and recreational buildings. The satellites are open seven days a week with reduced hours on Saturday and Sunday. The satellites are staffed by furloughed city employees who began their training on September 8 and, as part of their training, assisted in processing mail ballots for voters who submitted dual applications before the primary. Each satellite office also has a secure drop box in addition to seven other sites where drop boxes are located.&hellip;",

    "content": "Over five months have passed since the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. To provide economic support for the child care system, the $2 trillion relief package included $3.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. View our updated 2020 CCDGB state map These flexible child care dollars represented a 60% increase in total discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2020, and because the CARES Act was intended to be supplemental assistance to last for a few months, it is unsurprising that funding has largely dried out. As of September, the pandemic persists and both parents and providers continue to struggle as additional assistance has not arrived. In August, 70% of parents reported their child care programs were either still closed or were operating at reduced capacity or hours, and 14% of those parents indicated that their centers had permanently closed. Through June, BPC tracked how all 50 states used their supplemental CCDBG funds and found that a number had already depleted their funds and began to pull from other funding sources to sustain their child care systems through continued months of variable attendance, capacity restrictions, and increased health and safety costs. Click here for the information through June. As we continue tracking states’ efforts to support parents and providers, it is clear they are looking for other funding sources to continue supporting children and families or are having to revert back to their pre-COVID policies. This information is included in the map above. Due to the lack of further federal relief targeted for child care, 21 states have dedicated additional non-CCDBG funds to offer continued support for child care providers—14 of which used dollars they received from the Coronavirus Relief Fund. To distribute this support, states are offering grant programs to help providers make up for lost revenues. In July and August, 14 states offered child care grants to providers, and 24 states are doing so through the fall. However, due to the lack of further federal relief, the overall number of states offering grants this fall has declined since 47 states did so during the summer. Early in the summer, many states used their supplemental CCDBG funds to pay subsidies to providers based on pre-pandemic enrollment, rather than attendance, in order to provide stability during periods of low and variable attendance. Now, 13 of the 34 states that paid subsidies based on pre-pandemic enrollment over the summer have reverted to attendance-based payments, while 10 will continue their enrollment-based policies for future months. Interestingly, eight states that have reverted to attendance-based payments have instead decided to distribute funds via grants through the fall. This fall, states, families, and child care providers face an additional challenge in that most schools have shifted online: our August survey reports that over 70% of parents say their child’s public school will offer instruction either entirely online or in a hybrid format this fall. This change means that parents with school-age children below the age of&hellip;",

    "content": "In what will be the first time that the two candidates have met face-to-face since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the first of three general election presidential debates will take place between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden in Cleveland tomorrow, September 29. With the ongoing public health and economic crisis and various threats to the legitimacy of the election, we spoke with Bipartisan Policy Center experts on the critical issues they expect to be discussed on the debate stage. Here’s what our experts are watching for: COVID-19 is impacting all facets of the voting process in 2020. While the pre-pandemic Democratic primary debates focused mostly on election security as the highest risk to voting this year, the presidential debates will touch on more administrative aspects that are key to election legitimacy, such as inequities in the voting experience, the integrity of mail-in voting, and the safety of in-person polling sites. As we outlined in our recent video, there will be a surge of mail-in voting in November. The volume of mail ballots will slow down the results reporting in some key states. If the presidential contest is close, it is likely media organizations will not be able to accurately declare a winner on election night. The debate moderators should ask the candidates how they plan to handle the inevitable delays between election night and receiving the final vote counts. This void in information between election night and results reporting will be filled with partisans on both sides volleying claims of bias and incompetence. It is incumbent on both candidates to resist those forces and let the vote counting process proceed as it always does. The debate is also primed for a broader discussion of the integrity of mail-in voting and our electoral institutions. I expect to hear different opinions about the efficacy of mail-in ballots, and the moderators should press both candidates to support their claims in support or opposition to a voting option that half of Americans will be using this year. Recent reporting regarding the Postal Service’s delays and ways to mitigate those problems should be explored. Finally, in-person voting is still important to many American voters. Candidates should be asked how they would bolster the in-person process during a pandemic but also into the future. What is the appropriate role for the federal government in election administration? We often talk about economic &#8220;inflection points,&#8221; when the momentum turned in some long-lasting way that is often only apparent in the rearview mirror. It seems likely that the history books will deem these past few months a protracted &#8220;inflection summer,&#8221; with the virus resurging, federal aid expiring and the prospect of a steady economic recovery slipping through our hands. Perhaps it&#8217;s not too late to get the recovery back on track, but absent a further aid package before the election, much of this damage will be sealed, and we&#8217;ll be paying the price for years to come.

    "content": "The Michigan legislature recently passed two bipartisan election laws and sent them to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) for her signature. Election officials initiated these election year changes due to concern about processing an expected high volume of mail ballots in November because of COVID-19. While Michigan voters expanded mail ballot options to all voters by referendum in 2018, the state legislature did not make corresponding upstream and downstream policy changes to the election ecosystem that would facilitate a quicker, more efficient count. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Task Force on Elections made several recommendations in January 2020 that align, in part, with those adopted in Michigan on September 24. The bill package offers enhanced security for mail ballots, more processing time, correction of common voter errors, and better access for overseas military personnel and their spouses. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) and municipal election officials sought a seven-day pre-processing period based on BPC’s recommendation to enable an orderly processing of mail ballots before Election Day. State Sen. Ruth Johnson (R), a former Michigan secretary of state, sponsored the bill providing for 10 hours of pre-processing on the Monday prior to Election Day. The time allows for opening and verifying ballots and stops short of allowing administrators to run the ballots through a tabulator. This legislation is a major accomplishment for the legislature and was something the Michigan House and Senate leadership had opposed previously. The two bills include: Pre-processing of mail ballots, including removing the ballots from the return envelope and verifying the ballot number, the day before Election Day. The processing steps on the day prior will enable tabulation to begin shortly after 7 a.m. on Election Day. While BPC’s task force recommends at least 7 days to pre-process ballots before Election Day, yesterday’s compromise will greatly reduce the chance of administrators needing additional time after Election Day to complete the processing and counting of mail ballots. This legislative change applies only to the November 3 General Election. This bill clarifies the allowance of worker shifts and that the same staff is not required to continue working until all ballots are processed and tabulated. Standards for drop box security, which include security cameras and ensuring the boxes are constructed to deter tampering. The expansion of drop boxes as an option to return mail ballots and increasing security coincides with BPC’s Task Force on Elections recommendations. A 48-hour curing process that requires election administrators to contact voters if their mail ballot return envelopes are not signed or their signatures do not match the signatures on the voter file. BPC recommends a sufficient period for voters to correct any errors on their ballots in order for them to be counted. Permitting active duty military personnel and their spouses stationed overseas to electronically submit their ballots. This election year has been tumultuous. There were many reasons to worry that the election administrators in Michigan, a tightly-contested presidential battleground, would be forced to use outdated policies and procedures to count the vote,&hellip;",

    "content": "Language barriers can have a major impact on the asylum process for migrants, and the effects of those barriers have become an issue of increasing importance in the discussion of how to better manage the asylum process. Communication between federal officials, migrants, and their attorneys is critical, with a non-citizen’s understanding of the system’s processes and policies forming an important part of the federal government’s argument that due process exists in the immigration system. This primer explains the functions and challenges of language access in three aspects of the immigration system: enforcement actions, asylum processing, and the court system. Within the immigration context, language access refers to the ability of non-citizens to engage in immigration processes in their primary language. In the United States, individuals who do not speak English as their primary language, or have a limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English are classified as Limited English Proficiency, or LEP. The presence of LEP individuals in the immigration system is widespread, with approximately 89% of migrants in immigration court hearings receiving their hearings in a language other than English in 2018. Under federal law and executive orders, ensuring that these people receive equal treatment from federal agencies requires that every government agency receiving federal funds including state and local agencies must make a reasonable effort to provide meaningful language access for LEP individuals. These requirements extend to all persons in the United States, including those in the immigration system. For the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, language access is provided through Language Access Plans, agency policies that outline the rules and expectations of agency employees in accordance with the legal requirements for language access. In 2000, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,&#8221; which established the legal foundations for providing language access programs to non-citizens. The order, which enforces Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,1 requires agencies that receive federal funds to reasonably provide language services for all persons using their services. The policies and their legal bases have been largely unchallenged and unchanged since their inception with a few exceptions. After a 2010 Government Accountability Office report criticized their lack of language access programs, DOJ and later DHS established the Language Access Plans. DHS has made this a formal implementing regulation, establishing LAP standards and oversight procedures for their component agencies. When migrants are detained at the U.S. border, the Border Patrol agent must identify the language of the migrants. After the agent identifies the language, they may utilize contracted translators who are available by phone for field operations or available in person at some CBP offices. CBP and ICE staff prioritize resource allocation to specific languages based on the most common languages encountered at a site. DHS also provides Border Patrol agents with language training. All new Border Patrol agents are stationed at the U.S.-Mexico border for their initial postings and probationary period, even if they later transfer to&hellip;",

    "content": "Higher education, at its best, directs students to the development of their conscience and their capacity for independence of thought and judgment in civic life. These days, we often hear about First Amendment controversies on college campuses. We could make more sense of these controversies and the role of the First Amendment on campuses by going “back to basics” on the significance of the First Amendment. The First Amendment is sometimes revered as the most important right in American life, with its status as the first item in the Bill of Rights lending credence to this common sentiment. Actually, it is the First Amendment only by happenstance—it was the third amendment proposed by the first Congress in 1789, but what Congress labeled as the First and Second Amendments that year were not ratified by the states, so its proposed Third Amendment became our celebrated First Amendment. Despite its exalted status, the First Amendment has always been the subject of controversy in practice. Conservatives have long disliked judicial rulings that extend the First Amendment’s protection of free speech to pornography and such “expressions” as nude dancing. The Supreme Court’s permissive attitude toward pornography arises partly out of the difficulty of finding a “bright line” between artistic expression and purely prurient purposes and obscenity, most famously expressed in the remark of Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart that while he could not offer an intelligible definition of obscenity, “I know it when I see it.” The best the Supreme Court has been able to do is offer the three-part “Miller standard” (from the 1973 case Miller v. California) that permits restrictions on obscenity according to “local community standards.” Conversely some liberals have been critical of the First Amendment’s protection of “hate speech,” which, like obscenity, defies a clear and consistent definition, let alone a workable legal standard. The First Amendment’s free speech protections have long had some exceptions and limitations, such as speech that constitutes incitement or is libelous, and restrictions on “time, place, and manner” of protests, marches, and rallies have long been permissible under the First Amendment. But the Supreme Court has upheld speech acts that might be thought of as intimidation, such as cross burning, on grounds that, like its obscenity rulings, it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to mark out limits of “artistic expression.” Nowadays, more than parsing decades of case law and inherited legal doctrines about the First Amendment, we must draw back and revisit the first principles of free speech embedded in the First Amendment. Problems with free expression on campuses today arise less from dissatisfaction with how the First Amendment has been interpreted by the courts and implemented in practice but from new, widespread critiques of free speech. These new critiques posit that the concept of free speech itself is to be rejected on grounds that it is, in practice, a tool of oppression (sometimes even “white supremacy”) and that it leads to physical violence; this is the argument of Andrew Marantz, “Free Speech&hellip;",

    "content": "Since September 12, a network of non-profit organizations and local governments has been celebrating Welcoming Week, an event to celebrate American communities, including immigrants, under the theme “Creating Home Together.” As an immigrant who has navigated two differing cultures simultaneously in the United States, the meaning of home and belonging is something I hold dear, and I am certain it means a lot to many of my immigrant friends. My family moved to the United States from Nepal in 2004 on a Diversity Lottery Visa when I was 16 years old. The Diversity Visa Program is available to nationals from countries that have low rates of immigration to the United States, legally defined as those with less than 50,000 nationals admitted over the last five years. Each year the State Department offers 50,000 visas for the lottery, which are drawn from a random selection of applicants from those countries who meet strict eligibility requirements. The year my family immigrated to the United States, there were 4,259 diversity visa lottery winners from Nepal. Unfortunately, the State Department does not have an orientation program for winners to meet each other or gain knowledge about their new home, so you are largely left on your own to navigate a new country. Integrating in the United States and creating a new home, with a culture, language, and history vastly different than the one you are familiar with can be difficult. My family’s experience with integration presented several challenges and it was not much different than the norm. A qualitative study of diversity visa winners conducted by Nova Southeastern University in Florida showed that participants usually described their life experiences in the United States post-immigration as difficult and lonely. For my family, isolation was common, and it initially hindered my mother from finding jobs and integrating into American culture, which was driven by a lack of knowledge about the United States and language accessibility. Unfortunately, this struggle extends beyond my mother’s experiences. According to the Migration Policy Institute, in 2013 there were 25.1 million people in the United States who were considered Limited English Proficient. Among them, 19% were born in the United States to immigrant parents. These people often struggle with accessing various social services like health services and achieving economic mobility in the United States. A recent survey by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas-Austin and the Office of Welcoming Communities and Immigrant Affairs found that 39% of long-term immigrant respondents in Dallas said they could not speak English “well” or “well at all.” Like my parents, many of the respondents completed their education in a foreign country and may not have had the adequate English language skills to professionally succeed in the city. In my parents’ case, economic mobility and inclusion finally came after a long struggle with learning the English language and the social fabric of the United States through trial and error. That meant my mother having to enroll in English as a&hellip;",

    "content": "The coronavirus pandemic continues as Americans begin to focus on Election Day 2020. Much of the energy this year has focused on providing safe options to vote, including voting by mail. But there are increasingly vocal arguments that voting in person can be perfectly safe, too. Here’s what in person voters need to know to stay healthy as they exercise their right to vote. Experts are constantly learning more about this novel strain of coronavirus. To keep you safe, BPC continuously updates its summary of information about the virus as new information arises. We know that COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets that transfer from person to person during breathing, coughing, or speaking. There is also a possibility of contracting the virus from a frequently touched surface that has virus particles on it, then touching your face. These are all risks voters face when at a polling place that has not taken the proper safety precautions. Though polling places tend to be relatively small, voters can be there longer than 15 minutes and will touch voting equipment that hundreds or thousands of others have touched before. Physical distancing, wearing a mask, good hand hygiene, and knowing your particular risk of severe illness is essential to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus. Following these guidelines can make voting as safe as going to a supermarket. Good prevention practices are vital in this situation. In the Spring, election administrators scrambled during the primaries as the risks of COVID-19 became increasingly clear. Since then, the CDC has released recommendations to keep voters and poll workers safe for in-person voting. It boils down to offering voters more options for how to cast their ballots, stocking up on PPE and hand sanitizer, and adding regular disinfection of frequently touched surfaces to poll workers’ responsibilities. It is important to note that the pandemic disproportionately impacts communities of color. BPC has documented that black voters tend to wait far longer in lines to vote on Election Day. Our data comes from the 2018 federal election when there was no presidential contest on the ballot and thus turnout was lower than we might expect in 2020. In 2018, voters in precincts with 10% or fewer black voters waited on average just 5.1 minutes to vote. For voters in precincts composed of more than 90% black voters, the average wait time was 32.4 minutes. Because of these factors, it’s critical that these communities feel safe and secure while casting their vote. Mail voting is one of the safest options from a health perspective, but voters must pay close attention to deadlines and requirements for mail in ballots and early voting in their state. Another benefit of increased mail in voting is that it reduces the number of in-person voters, which should allow for more social distancing at the polls. Just as social distancing was key to flattening the curve of the virus early on, spreading out voters across mail, early, and Election Day voting can keep the&hellip;",

    "content": "We&#8217;re getting close to November 3rd: Election Day. But be prepared – things will be different this November. Why? Here are three reasons. Because so many people will vote by mail this year, it will take a lot longer to count ballots and report results. This is not a bad thing. It simply means our election officials are working carefully and not rushing to judgment. But beware of disinformation campaigns rushing to fill the airwaves and social media with claims of fraud, abuse, and other shenanigans. Consider the source, and remember, the “calls” you hear from media on Election Night are not final results. Make sure that what you’re hearing is based on OFFICIAL announcements from local and state election officials. Everything else is just noise. You may have always voted at the school or community center down the street. But this year, a lot of neighborhood voting sites are being consolidated into larger polling places to keep staff and voters safe. You should get a notification if your polling place has moved, but you can always check at CanIVote.org. CanIVote.org is a NONPARTISAN site hosted by the National Association of Secretaries of State, which—along with BPC and others—also hosts the #trustedinfo2020 campaign against disinformation. And yes, consolidated polling places and other public health precautions may mean longer lines if you vote in person. Because of the pandemic, many states are expanding absentee voting. Even before the pandemic, five states already sent every registered voter a ballot in the mail about three weeks before election day. Another 29 states and the District of Columbia have what’s called a “no excuse” absentee voting system. That means you don’t need any reason to vote by mail – you just need to fill out an absentee ballot request form. Many states will mail them to you if you’re registered to vote, but if you’re not sure what your state does, go to CanIVote.org. And even if your state requires a reason for by-mail voting, many have expanded those excuses to include concerns about the coronavirus. In many states you can already request your absentee ballot. Do your part to flatten the curve of absentee voting by requesting and casting your ballot early. Voting in the middle of a pandemic will be unlike anything we’ve experienced in the past century. But understanding your rights and being prepared ahead of time can help make sure your voice will be heard at the ballot box.",

    "content": "This election season will test the abilities of election officials to be creative and flexible like no other. While the media has reported extensively on mail-in voting, which is valid and safe, it is crucial to remember that there will still be a lot of in-person voting before and on election day. As safety precautions are being implemented to facilitate a safe in-person voting experience, there is still one major concern across the country: poll worker shortages. Poll workers are vital for elections to run properly. They are the lifeblood of elections. In normal times, poll workers crosscheck necessary documents, guide people through lines, and help voters through the process from handing over the ballot to feeding it into the scanner. Poll workers during a pandemic are even more essential because, on top of their normal duties, they will also be the ones cleaning the center, enforcing social distancing measures, and encouraging voters to wear masks. Poll workers in most states historically have skewed older than the average voter. According to the Election Administration Voting Survey from the EAC, in 2018 26% of poll workers were between the ages of 41-60, 31% were 61-70, and 27% were over the age of 71. The population most at-risk for permanent complications and death from Covid-19 increases with age. Since the CDC recommends that people in at-risk groups stay a socially distanced as possible, many citizens who normally work polls during elections will not have this option come November. That’s why election administrators are struggling to recruit and train a new crop of poll workers for November. To recruit a new class of workers and volunteers, they are getting creative. There are three options for this November: Voting may look different this year, but it is still important to perform your civic duty. Without poll workers, we would not be able to vote in a safe and organized fashion, even in normal times.

    "content": "As the pandemic persists, K-12 schools are rethinking how they provide instruction. Parents are also being forced to rethink how they provide care for their school-age children during the week. A new analysis of national survey data collected in early August by Morning Consult and the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Early Childhood Initiative offers key insights into how working parents are making school-age care decisions as schools shift online. The data reveal that there are differences in preference for formal school-age child care between rural and urban communities that will put significant pressure on urban child care providers. Affordability concerns mean many families who previously relied on formal child care for their youngest children are having to resort to informal care from family and friends for their school-age children. And many parents indicate they will likely have to change their work hours and stay home from work to provide school-age care even though many cannot work remotely. It’s clear that parents are struggling to find consistent, affordable care for their students as this unprecedented school year gets underway. In order to relieve pressure on families, Congress must offer additional aid to support child care and afterschool programs so they may meet the increased need for school-age care. Among the 1,000 working parents with children under age six who were surveyed nationally, 423 also had children of school age, ages 6-12, who are likely too young to remain home without care. Of these families, 73% reported that their region’s public school district had opted for an entirely online or hybrid format, meaning their children will need some type of care when they are not in school. However, some communities are seeing more widespread school closures than others. In our sample, families in urban communities are experiencing more online and hybrid school formats than families in rural communities, as 81% of parents in urban settings reported that their district will be either online or hybrid, while 60% of parents in rural settings reported the same. 81% of parents in urban settings reported that their district will be either online or hybrid, while 60% of parents in rural settings reported the same. These shifting school formats present a serious school-age care challenge for single-parent families and families with two working parents. Some of these families have said they will look for formal child care—either center-based or home-based programs—to address their needs. In urban settings, single-parent families and families with both parents working are more likely to look for formal school-age child care arrangements (29%) than families in rural settings (9%). Since more urban schools are set to provide online instruction than rural schools and since parents in urban settings indicate they are more likely to search for formal child care if their school closes, demand for child care for school-age children will likely be greatest in urban communities. However, providers in these communities may not be able to meet this demand. Child care providers in urban areas have been particularly devastated by the pandemic.&hellip;",

Freedom of expression includes freedom to express views grounded in religious identity, and we take you to a university campus where a campus president responds to a student government leader leaving office after her beliefs sparked controversy. Letter to the University of Southern California Community Carol L. Folt | Office of the President, University of Southern California | August 6, 2020 In response to the resignation of the USC student body vice president in the face of harassment for her pro-Israel views, President Folt wrote, “I believe it is critically important to state explicitly and unequivocally that anti-Semitism in all of its forms is a profound betrayal of our principles and has no place at the university. We must condemn any bias or prejudice that is based on a person’s race, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristic. What happened to Rose Ritch is unacceptable.” Whose Music Theory? Colleen Flaherty | Inside Higher Ed | August 7, 2020 University of North Texas administrators have appointed a faculty panel to investigate the Journal of Schenkerian Studies, a peer-reviewed music theory journal published at UNT. The investigation began after a scholar criticized 19th century music theorist Heinrich Schenker as an “ardent racist and German nationalist,” and the journal responded with an issue devoted to a symposium of responses. The issue spurred groups of UNT music graduate students and faculty to call for the university to dissolve the journal, identify an anonymous contributor to the symposium, and fire its faculty editor for creating a “platform to promote racism.” Five of Six Charges Dropped Against Stockton Student Whose Trump Zoom Background Caused Stir Claire Lowe | The Press of Atlantic City | August 12, 2020 “Stockton University has rescinded five of the six charges in a complaint against a doctoral student over a Facebook post that stemmed from backlash over his use of a Zoom background of President Donald Trump.” A classmate filed a complaint with administrators after reading the post, which criticized “the leftist agenda of Black Lives Matter and the white self haters .” After investigating, administrators dropped charges of discrimination, harassment, creating a hostile environment, causing harm, and cyberbullying.

    "content": "Anyone who works in immigration soon discovers that it is a complicated maze of laws, regulations, and procedures governing who may enter the United States under what circumstances and for how long. These statutes also specify who is required to leave, under what circumstances, and whether penalties are imposed. When it comes to employment-based immigration, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) spells out the defining terms, selection criteria, requirements for employers, and admissions steps in sections scattered throughout the law. In terms of employment-based immigration, the INA assigns specific duties to the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, and the Department of Labor’s Division of Foreign Labor Certification. When it comes to foreign nationals who work without proper employment authorization as well as employers who knowingly hire unauthorized foreign nationals (commonly called employer sanctions), DHS’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the lead agency. DOL’s Wage and Hour Division is responsible for administering and enforcing worker protections provided in several temporary foreign worker visa categories. The Wage and Hour Division’s primary duties include enforcing the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor protections. The Department of Justice’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section investigates and prosecutes charges of immigration-related employment discrimination. For those counting, that is six federal agencies. Rather than march through this maze to identify subsections that warrant reforming and the agencies that merit reorganizing, I propose envisioning employment-based immigration policies as plane geometry. Each plane represents a key perspective of the reform debate. Despite a commonality that crosses each of these five planes, most of the time it seems these planes are floating in space without intersecting. Arguably, the planes are not even parallel. We can nonetheless use these planes to build a structure for reforming employment-based immigration. The intersection of the employers and workers (second and third) planes is surprisingly possible. A shift away from the arduous up-front process of labor certification and attestation to an internet-based recruitment system that uses sector-centered paths could alleviate much of the paperwork burdens and bureaucratic delays. Rather than emphasizing the frontend scrutiny of employers petitioning for foreign workers, the reform efforts would be better served by focusing on “quality of life” immigration enforcement on the backend. As I have written elsewhere, quality of life immigration enforcement would prioritize investigations of specific worksites for wage, hour, and safety violations, sweatshop conditions, and trafficking in persons. That it is rare for employers who hire unauthorized workers to face criminal or civil penalties suggests that the law may need to be tweaked, in addition to be more vigorously enforced, so that employers who violate immigration law are prosecuted. Quality of life enforcement also would encompass reliable employment verification systems so that honest employers are held harmless. The national economic interest plane would include policy options of a point system based upon specific criteria or an independent commission that annually proposes criteria—either of which aims to meet the nation’s labor force needs.

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause unprecedented strain on American workers and the country’s unemployment insurance (UI) system. Although Congress acted swiftly in March to expand eligibility for UI and provide an additional $600 in weekly benefits, this supplemental benefit expired on July 31, bringing forth a rapid and substantial drop in income for the more than 28 million displaced workers receiving UI benefits. At the same time, state systems responsible for delivering UI benefits are plagued by administrative and computer systems infrastructure failures, delaying benefit delivery and contributing to financial instability among vulnerable Americans. Most recently, President Trump issued an executive memorandum that reallocated funds from other purposes to temporarily provide a weekly $300 supplemental benefit to many UI recipients, but the program has been slow to roll out and funding will likely run out this month. As the country enters the next phase of economic recovery, Congress should act to provide a modified federal benefit supplement that delivers crucial relief to struggling families, encourages work, and addresses the administrative challenges of state UI programs. Amid the ongoing public health and economic crises, jobless workers still need additional assistance to pay recurring bills, such as rent. Indeed, research suggests that the $600 weekly federal benefit bump has played an important role for both consumers and the broader economy, estimating a 29% decline in spending among unemployed households without the supplemental benefit. Continuing the $600 supplemental benefit design, however, would result in five out of every six recipients collecting more from unemployment benefits than from returning to work, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. Such an approach would be inequitable for those who remain in the workforce, and over time, could lead to reduced employment and slower economic growth. COVID-19 has also heightened the administrative challenges that have long plagued state UI programs, delaying benefit delivery. Earlier this spring, a BPC survey of likely voters found that only 61% of those who had applied for UI (and were not aware of having been denied) had received their benefits. Furthermore, outmoded administrative systems have generally shown to be incapable of implementing anything more sophisticated than a flat, across-the-board benefit adjustment, which has hampered the federal government’s options for enhancing state benefit levels during the crisis. Specifically, policymakers have been unable to calibrate supplemental UI benefits to wage replacement rates—to ensure total UI benefits do not exceed previous earnings. These challenges are partially due to the fact that federal funding for UI administration has declined by 30% over the past 20 years (adjusted for inflation). States have had to make do with less funding, causing their technology systems to suffer. State UI systems need additional support to respond to this crisis and ensure dislocated workers efficiently receive their benefits. Congress should supplement weekly benefits in a way that also provides states with federal funds to address their administrative challenges, and more broadly, support for their other COVID-related needs.

    "content": "With the conclusion of the party conventions last month, we took a detailed look at Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s Plan For Securing Our Values as a Nation of Immigrants and President Donald Trump’s newly released agenda for a possible second term.1 Although immigration is not at the forefront of the public’s mind in the leadup to November 4, 2020, a more detailed look at both the Democratic and Republican plans gave us a window into what a new or continuing administration could bring in terms of immigration reform. After a detailed analysis of Biden’s platform, we found the Democratic nominee made significant updates and expansions from when the platform was first released to his approach on reforming the legal immigration system should he enter the White House in January. In contrast, Trump’s second-term agenda reiterates hardline positions he has held throughout his time in office. It also does not include any specific mention of reforms to legal immigration, instead focusing on ending illegal immigration and protecting American workers. Below, we outline five key takeaways from the candidates’ platforms and their implications for immigration reform in 2021. As the United States continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Democratic platform leans heavily on emphasizing the extent to which immigrants grow and support our economy, and, theoretically, the extent they can contribute to economic recovery in post-pandemic world. In emphasizing wages, union, and job portability, however, the platform also acknowledges that some aspects of the current visa system may hurt American and immigrant workers. In his speech during the final night of the Democratic convention, Biden noted that rebuilding the economy post-COVID can be done in part via an immigration system that “powers our economy and reflects our values.” However, it is apparent that the reforms Biden proposes will rely heavily on legislation being passed by Congress, meaning it remains to be seen as to whether a newly elected Congress will cooperate. The platform also lacks details on how Biden plans to achieve these ambitious goals, which will be critical to see whether any such reforms can be achieved. Trump’s announced second-term immigration agenda offers few additional details or distinctions from the immigration goals of his first term, which emphasized pushing for stricter border security and immigration enforcement. Like Biden, the agenda does not offer significant details for how the administration would achieve these goals. Even in the short, bulleted list, Trump primarily focuses on illegal immigration and enforcement, both pillars of his policy approach to date. In his speech during the final night of the Republican convention, Trump emphasized his contributions to the border wall, stopping “asylum fraud,” and deporting gang members, describing his immigration policy as a whole as “pro-American.” Trump has held firm to his hardline immigration stances during his presidency. He made immigration a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign and raised the issue&#8217;s profile again leading up to the 2018 midterms, so it&#8217;s reasonable to expect he will once again focus on it during the remaining&hellip;",

    "content": "1. What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is a disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is transmitted between humans and currently circulating in over 100 countries around the world. As of January 14, 2021, there are more than 92,563, 271, cases and more than 1,983,691 deaths worldwide (see updated cases and deaths here). Over the last several days, there have been more cases occurring outside China than within the country. In the United States, there are more than 10,110,552 cases and at least 385,503 deaths. Over the last several days, there have been more cases occurring outside China than within the country. 2. How does it spread? The coronavirus spreads through droplets released most commonly from a sneeze or a cough and can also be spread through small aerosolized particles. Additionally, it may be transmitted by touching contaminated objects, like a table or door handle, and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. In general, exposure to individuals with significant symptoms in close-proximity (within 6 feet) over an extended period of time (15 minutes or greater) increases the chances of exposure to COVID-19. Pre-symptomatic spread is also thought to contribute to transmission, particularly in the 48 hours preceding the start of symptoms. There have also been reports of true asymptomatic spread of the virus and this is an active area of investigation by health officials. 3. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Common symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of smell or taste, and a headache. Health officials say that in more than 80% of cases, symptoms will be mild, and individuals will be able to self-manage at home as if they were treating a common cold or the flu. In the rest of the cases, symptoms may progress potentially resulting in worsening shortness of breath and cough and require medical intervention. 4. Who is at highest risk for severe complications? Individuals who are elderly and who have chronic conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity are at highest risk for hospitalizations, severe complications and deaths. People with compromised immune systems, such as someone going through cancer treatments, are also at higher risk for infection if exposed. 5. What is the fatality rate? The current fatality rate is roughly 5%. However, it is widely considered that the number of cases is significantly higher due to asymptomatic cases or mildly symptomatic individuals who never received a medical evaluation and testing. Thus, it is quite likely that the true fatality rate is significantly lower. Some experts believe that the true mortality rate associated with COVID-19 may be roughly 1% or less than 1%. For comparison, the case fatality rate for seasonal influenza is approximately 0.1%. When the pandemic began in March, the mortality rate was 3.4%. 6. What can I do to protect myself? First, it’s important not to panic but arm yourself with facts about the disease so you can make smart decisions. It is critical that all Americans practice good hand hygiene, which includes&hellip;",

    "content": "When reading the Nutrition Facts label on your food packages, perusing your child’s school lunch menu, or using the MyPlate food tracker app, have you ever thought about where the information, nutrition standards, or recommendations come from? With so much confusion around what to eat and skyrocketing rates of obesity and diet-related diseases like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers, trusted evidence-based guidelines, such as the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, are pivotal standards for improving our nation’s health. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans are the government’s official recommendations for what we should eat for optimal health. To ensure these guidelines are up to date, every five years the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) together appoint a group of experts to serve on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), which is charged with reviewing the research on diet and health and making recommendations to the federal government on the current state of the evidence. The Guidelines must be based on current science and medicine. The 2020 DGAC recently completed its work with the publication of a comprehensive 835-page report that was open for public comment. USDA and HHS should utilize the recommendations of these experts in developing the official 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. As former secretaries of agriculture, we presided over the development of past editions of the Dietary Guidelines. We understand the rigor of the evidence review process. The 2020 Advisory Committee took their task of reviewing the research seriously, and with support from USDA researchers, issued conclusions and evidence grades for more than 50 research questions. Their work was informed by more than 62,000 public comments received between March 2019 and June 2020. Taken together, these findings informed the committee’s overarching conclusions and recommendations for diet and health. While the federal government is not required to take the committee’s advice in developing the Dietary Guidelines, it should. The 2020 DGAC encourages a healthy dietary pattern with more vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains, low- or nonfat dairy, lean meat and poultry, seafood, nuts, and unsaturated vegetable oils, and fewer red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains. Their report notes that this dietary pattern was consistently related to positive health outcomes, including reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, and brain health. The committee also concluded that we consume too much added sugars, which are added to foods during packaging or processing, and recommends that children under age 2 consume none at all. Foods high in added sugars, like sugary drinks, candy, and desserts, provide excess calories with few nutrients, which leads to overweight and obesity. Two-thirds of Americans consume more added sugar than the 10 percent of calories recommended by the current Dietary Guidelines, an amount more than double the 6 percent of calories recommended by the 2020 DGAC. To help reduce added sugar intake among Americans who receive federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a population&hellip;",

    "content": "With no end in sight to the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic fallout, unprecedented levels of joblessness continue to test America’s patchwork UI system. Some state UI programs are experiencing long delays in providing benefits to unemployed workers, upending lives and threatening financial security. In late spring, BPC conducted a poll suggesting that just 61% of UI applicants had received the benefits for which they are eligible, with 30% describing the process as difficult to navigate. These challenges are rooted in the fact that funding for UI administration, the vast majority of which comes from the federal government, is on a long-term downward trend, having declined by 30% on an inflation-adjusted basis over the past 20 years. Consequently, in a 2017 survey of state workforce agencies, 55% of surveyed states indicated that they faced a “serious” or “critical” funding shortfall in UI administration. Furthermore, not all state UI programs are created equal. States have broad discretion over the design and implementation of their programs, and many are running on antiquated computer systems. Nearly 80% of state workforce agencies characterized their IT systems as “barely functional” or “needs improvement” in 2017—long before the current economic jolt—and 12 states use computer systems built with COBOL, a decades-old coding language whose programmers have mostly aged out of the labor force. While states bear a majority of responsibility for the design of their UI programs, the federal government does maintain a significant footprint. Specifically, UI is funded via payroll taxes on employers collected by both the federal government and the states. These revenues are held by the U.S. Treasury Department in individual trust funds for each state. States are not held to reserve requirements, meaning the federal government serves as the backstop, providing loans to states that experience shortfalls. States that keep their UI programs in a healthy financial state during periods of economic growth receive preferential borrowing terms during economic downturns. Additionally, states that hold no debt or pay back their loans in a timely manner receive a tax credit that reduces employers’ federal UI tax burden. (See our previous blog for more details on how the system operates.) In exchange for federal support, states are required to pay out benefits in a timely manner, but many are struggling to do so, a result of historic underfunding combined with unprecedented joblessness that has illuminated glaring shortcomings in UI staffing and infrastructure. With tens of millions of Americans relying on these state programs, it is imperative that Congress act to increase the speed and efficiency of UI benefit delivery. This will require additional resources, and while states could theoretically fund these improvements themselves, their budgets are already under enormous strain. Congress should provide support for UI administration in a forthcoming COVID relief package. In March 2020, Congress allocated $1 billion for UI administration in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, but continued delays suggest that additional support is needed. Further resources could address short-term challenges—for example, surge staffing to deal with heightened demand—as well as tackle&hellip;",

    "content": "Access to high-quality, affordable child care is important for working families, and now it is necessary for our nationwide economic recovery during and after the pandemic. Frontline workers, work-from-home employees, and student parents all need child care in various capacities—a need that will be even more pressing as many elementary schools do not plan to reopen with a full-time, in-person schedule. The key word in any conversation about child care access is “affordability”. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, families struggled to pay for child care. An October 2019 BPC/Morning Consult survey found that almost one-third of families who earn under $50,000 a year find it very difficult to afford child care, compared to only 10% of high-income households. The survey also found that 67% of low-income families cut back on spending for necessities, such as food and transportation, to pay for child care. Race and ethnicity are related to barriers to affordable child care as well. The Rapid-EC Project from the University of Oregon found that, during the pandemic, Black and Latino households experienced more financial and material hardship than others, independent of income. Particularly, 12% of Black households and 14% of Latino households reported difficultly in affording child care. While the need for affordable child care is clear, the definition of affordability is not. The most commonly cited definition is the 7% affordability benchmark from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in which child care is considered affordable if it does not exceed 7% of a household’s income. However, as described in the preamble to the 2016 Child Care and Development Fund final rule and recent testimony to the House Education and Labor Committee, this 7% benchmark was never meant to be an affordability metric for all families. Rather, it is a recommendation for how much a low-income, working family receiving a child care subsidy should pay as a co-payment for child care services. As the current child care market is driven by private pay families, with only 6.4% of children in early childhood education programs receiving public or private subsidies, broadly applying the 7% benchmark overlooks the significant public funding covering the gap between 7% of a family’s income and the price of child care. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 requires states to establish a sliding fee scale for parents who receive subsidies in order to share the costs of their child care services. After the bipartisan reauthorization of CCDBG, HHS recommended parental copayments not exceed the benchmark of 7% of a household’s income. HHS chose the 7% benchmark to reflect U.S. Census Bureau data that showed the average percent of monthly income spent by all families on child care stayed consistent at about 7% from 1997 to 2011. Because low-income families disproportionately spend more of their income on child care compared to higher income families, HHS recommended the 7% benchmark in order to achieve parity in child care cost burden. This benchmark only applies to the required copayments required&hellip;",

    "content": "On August 12, 2020, the State Department issued guidance on the national interest exceptions to the presidential proclamation that suspended entry of certain visa categories.1 That proclamation, signed by President Donald Trump on June 22, 2020, argued that the continued entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants under certain visa categories would pose a threat to the employment of U.S. workers because it would displace them during COVID-19 recovery. The June 2020 proclamation suspended entry of all nonimmigrants and their dependents applying for H-1B, H-2B, L, and J visas from outside the United States who already did not have a valid U.S. nonimmigrant visa or any valid official travel document such as a transportation letter, an appropriate boarding foil2, or an advance parole on the date the proclamation was issued. However, the proclamation did outline exceptions for foreign workers entering the United States to perform temporary labor in America’s food supply chain as an essential employee. It also included exceptions for those whose entry into the United States is considered of national interest by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees. The National Interest Exceptions guidance issued by the State Department puts in place several concessions that may weaken the proclamation and offer solutions to those applying for nonimmigrant temporary visas from abroad. According to the State Department, some of the key exceptions under the national interest waiver for nonimmigrants include:3 These exceptions from the State Department may help reduce some backlash from business and trade entities who have filed several lawsuits against the Trump administration for the proclamation. In July, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the National Retail Federation filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department claiming that the visa restrictions would drive talented individuals away from the United States. On August 11, 2020, that lawsuit was supported by tech firms including Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Microsoft, and Netflix, who rely heavily on H-1B visa holders for specialized talents. While the guidance does not change the proclamation or eliminate the existing litigation against the administration, it does offer some relief by creating fairly expansive exceptions for individuals and their dependents, who otherwise would not qualify for a temporary visa, to apply to travel to the United States even under the presidential proclamation. A very significant exception is for those individuals who are applying for H-1B and L visas to resume ongoing employment in the United States and their family members. This exception could help reunite family members stranded abroad due to the June order as well as assist U.S. employers from financial hardship which may be caused from replacing foreign workers barred from traveling to the United States. The policy also generally broadens exceptions to the ban on H, L, and J visas by allowing medical professionals directly or indirectly working on COVID-19, their dependents, and individuals coming to support them, such as au pairs, to travel to the United States.

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted the lives of working families, especially those with very young children. Access to high-quality, affordable child care has always been a challenge and this has only been exacerbated by the virus. In August 2020, the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult surveyed parents of young children to better understand parents’ child care needs during this time. The results are alarming. With over 70% of parents reporting that their child care programs either closed or are operating at reduced capacity or hours, finding quality child care that fits within a parent’s budget is even more challenging and directly impacts a parent’s ability to work. As parents consider returning their children to child care, they overwhelmingly expressed concern about the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and the importance of health and safety measures in child care programs. As the new school year approaches, parents are struggling to balance their fears of COVID-19 spread with work demands and child care needs. To better understand the impact of COVID-19 on child care today, the survey looked at child care utilization before and during COVID-19. The survey looked at employed parents with children under age five who were paying and not paying for care in January 2020. Forty-five percent of parents surveyed were paying for child care in January 2020. This ranged from 34% of parents in rural communities who were paying for child care to 54% in urban communities. Of parents not paying for child care, 30% had a family member or relative providing care for their children and 14% had members in their household alternating work hours to provide care. To better understand the current supply of child care, we asked parents to report on the operating status of their previous child care arrangements. The changes are stark, with over 70% of child care programs either closed or operating at reduced capacity or hours. Some programs were required to close while others limited their hours, reduced capacity, or reserved space for children of essential workers. The extent of these changes varied by program type, however. Among parents using home-based providers in January 2020, 29% reported their program remained open throughout the pandemic. On the other hand, 32% of parents who were using a formal child care center prior to the pandemic say their child care provider has temporarily closed with plans to reopen, 14% are permanently closed, and 30% of parents reported their program is open with limited hours or spaces, or has remained open only for children of essential workers. Just as child care has changed, so too have parents’ work demands. Plans for returning to work are further complicated by parents’ fear of exposing their children to the virus, thereby impacting their decisions to return to work. While some parents have the option to work remotely, 22% of parents cannot return to work in person without child care. During COVID-19, 30% of parents had sought child care, and 54% found it difficult to find child&hellip;",

    "content": "Coronavirus forced a sudden move to more or less virtual conventions. But long-term changes in our politics have been pushing in this direction for years. Once, the conventions were primarily party-driven affairs with suspense and sometimes surprising choices of nominees, however, now they are driven by the campaigns of the presidential candidates with controlled and scripted messages—a perfect fit for a virtual convention. For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, party conventions were gatherings of important state party leaders who came together to select a presidential nominee. They were also used to adopt a party platform, highlight other candidates for office, and to party with members of their party. These leaders had to bargain with each other to come to a consensus on the presidential nominee, the vice-presidential nominee, and the platform. Sometimes this bargaining resulted in long drawn out fights and compromised choices of nominees. The 1924 Democratic convention saw 103 rounds of voting over 11 days to finally select its nominee John Davis, who had received less than 3% in the first round, and who went on to be soundly defeated by Calvin Coolidge in the general election. Vice presidents were also selected by the convention, usually as a compromise to assuage factions within the party. Democrats, for example, had a long history of pairing a southern vice-presidential nominee with a non-southern presidential nominee. Not surprisingly, presidents and vice presidents in this era were not particularly close allies, and vice presidents played a much less significant role in governing than they do today. Platform fights were also legendary, with factional and regional leaders in the party bargaining over party planks. From 1912 to 1968, several states introduced presidential primaries, and some presidential candidates collected delegates by appealing to the vote of the people. While this was a change, state party leaders controlled many other delegates, meaning that conventions still picked the nominees. Since 1968, the people’s voice in primaries and caucuses became dominant. Conventions exist to rubberstamp the people’s choice of a presidential nominee. Of course, there are still vestiges of older party control like super delegates or the gathering of party faithful, however, there is no great suspense of dissension. The nominee is known before the convention commences and the vice-presidential nominee is picked by the presidential nominee instead of by party leaders during the convention itself. There might be some bargaining about speakers and planks of the platform, but this bargaining is between the presidential nominee and perhaps a rival candidate or group. The result is usually some extra speakers and a compromised platform, not a disruption of the convention or changes fundamentally at odds with the presidential nominee. Now to virtual conventions. They are the natural evolution of this move to conventions dominated by the presidential nominee rather than the bargaining of state party leaders. Even the limited options for opposing factions to boo, walk out of a convention, or generally express their displeasure are eliminated. Each speech or video is scripted and approved.&hellip;",

The surveys focus on a number of issues, including the cost of child care and how it affects a family’s budget, the impact of COVID-19 on a parent’s work status and their child care needs, and how school reopening plans influence a parent’s decision around child care. We hope the data collected can help us better understand the needs of parents around the country and guide policy recommendations that can work for them. BPC Parent Survey Series December 2022: When Child Care Harms Businesses, Who Picks Up the Pieces? In today’s tight labor market, businesses across the country are struggling to recruit and retain staff. What many businesses do not realize is that parents’ child care responsibilities are part of the problem. Nearly 7 in 10 business owners do not think child care impacts their ability to hire or retain staff, but parents report child care significantly impacts their ability to work, leading them to struggle to meet work responsibilities, change hours, or leave the workforce. BPC’s latest survey sought to understand how child care responsibilities impact parents and small business owners. Specific research objectives include: Understand the needs, demands, and responsibilities of working parents Understand the experiences of small business owners/ executives Investigate the gaps and overlaps of parents’ experiences and small business owners’ perceptions To learn more read our blog. June 2022: Understanding Employed Parents Using Informal Child Care Nearly one-third of children do not have access to formal child care. But why? Can parents not afford it? Is there not a slot available? Is the child care center too far away? Or do some parents not want to use a formal child care setting—a center or in-home based care? Understanding barriers and the issues keeping parents out of the formal child care system is critical to developing a system that works for child care businesses and families. A new survey conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of BPC seeks to understand parents using informal child care. Specific research objectives include: Reasons why employed parents choose informal child care Circumstances for using informal child care Interest and barriers in using formal child care Community responsibility for providing child care To learn more, watch the webinar or read our blog. December 2021: Understanding Native American Parent’s Child Care Needs The United States boasts 574 federally recognized tribal nations and Alaska Native villages and 326 federal Indian reservations. As of 2019, there were approximately 5.7 million people in the U.S. who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), or about 1.7 percent of the U.S. population. In 2020, there was an estimated 594,670 AI/AN children. BPC wanted to better understand child care use among AI/AN parents used to serve these children.

    "content": "As we near the centennial of the 19th Amendment becoming law on August 26, 1920, campus communities across the country are planning a slate of events in honor of the historic struggle for women’s voting rights. The celebrations move forward even in the face of COVID-19, with archivists and faculty creating virtual exhibits, programs, and websites. For college students returning to remote or partially remote campuses during this pandemic, the centennial celebrations offer insights about the free expression culture they are likely to grapple with this year. A majority of students say that their campus environment deters some from voicing their opinions openly, and even liberal public intellectuals think that “the free exchange of ideas…is daily becoming more constricted.” A growing number of students, as well as most Americans, believe that they cannot speak their minds because their views don’t fit the zeitgeist. The history of the suffrage movement should provide these college students with a clear lesson: contemporary norms can be a poor standard by which to judge whether an argument is too controversial to be permitted in the public square. The dissension that dogged the fight for women’s basic rights exemplifies that free expression is for liberal causes, not just conservative ones. Our society benefits by maintaining a wide berth for speech and broadening the participation of marginalized communities. Advocating for suffrage was a radical and provocative act in the 19th century, when the female enfranchisement movement began to organize formally in the United States. As historian Ellen Carol DuBois argues, by pursuing the vote “suffragists demanded for women a kind of power and a connection with the social order not based on the institution of the family.” The vote was a tool with potential to upend the social order, meaning that pursuit of the vote was a “radical element in women’s protest against their oppression.” During the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848—regarded as the beginning of the movement in the United States—68 women and 32 men out of about 300 attendees signed the Declaration of Sentiments. The Declaration claimed voting as an a priori right for women, declared that gender inequality was an aberration of God’s creation, and excoriated “the history of mankind” for hoisting “absolute tyranny” over the female sex. Demands for the vote were controversial even among convention-goers. Resolution number nine, the section of the Declaration demanding enfranchisement, would have been voted down but for an eleventh-hour speech by committed suffragist Frederick Douglass. Veteran activist Lucretia Mott urged Stanton to ditch the resolution for fear it would make the convention appear “ridiculous.” The convention was widely derided in the press. Columnists took the delegates to task as the “Insurrection of the Woman,” the “Reign of the Petticoats,” “excessively silly,” “amusing,” “the most shocking and unnatural incident in the history of womanity.” Contemporary mores bolstered detractors’ confidence: “It requires no argument to show that this is all wrong.” Many suffragists could not withstand the national onslaught and retracted their signatures.

    "content": "Artificial intelligence is affecting many of the challenges facing the nation today—like the pandemic, unemployment, and racial inequities—and bringing new ones to the forefront. AI is also having significant effects on virtually every sector of the economy, but the United States faces several bottlenecks to responsibly unlocking its full potential. These bottlenecks include developing a skilled workforce, ensuring inclusivity, optimizing data use, encouraging public and private research and development, building computing capacity, establishing good technical standards, and fostering public trust and positive attitudes towards AI. Achieving these objectives will require a strong effort and collaboration among the public and private sector. Advancing and utilizing AI technologies requires a skilled workforce. Currently, there is a considerable AI talent shortage that needs to be addressed. Attracting, training, and retaining AI talent becomes critical in this environment. The U.S. educational system and workforce training programs will play a key role in this matter, as will immigration policies that properly balance various policy goals. In addition to closing the AI talent gap, policymakers need to think about how to deal with the broad disruptions caused by AI and automation throughout the economy with jobs both created and destroyed. Forecasters anticipate growth in demand for skills and tasks that require creative thinking, analytical skills, and emotional intelligence. However, transitioning workers will not be easy, and policymakers will need to update existing workforce training and educational programs to manage the disruption. Technology can greatly exacerbate inequality and social disruption if mismanaged, but it also has the potential to improve living standards and create new opportunities for the country. The fruits of growth from technology need to be shared across the board and meaningfully include underrepresented communities and marginalized groups. Therefore, policymakers should make promoting inclusivity a top priority. Further, inclusivity and diversity in the technology sector can help ensure that AI systems and products are designed by a workforce that reflects the broader makeup of society. Promoting inclusivity in the economy requires a holistic approach. Policymakers should carefully evaluate workforce training programs, the social safety net, and other relevant policies to ensure they are well-suited for the AI-driven economy. Data plays a critical role in training AI systems. Access to quality data will be a major source of competitive advantage for many private firms and governments. The AI-driven economy will require continued thinking about ways to better collect, store, share, and utilize data, while promoting security, privacy, and consumer protections. Policymakers should thoroughly consider and review policies and initiatives, such as federal data hubs and best practice guidelines, when trying to address the various data challenges AI brings. Standards and frameworks can help promote innovation in a responsible manner by providing AI practitioners with a common language and specific ethical and quality standards to abide by. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has been a leader in helping develop standards for AI. NIST’s plan for developing AI technical standards emphasizes that U.S. government agencies should prioritize those that are “inclusive and accessible, open and transparent,&hellip;",

Rumors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will patrol voting locations have emerged online in the last several years. In 2018, flyers making this claim were found near polling places in Milwaukee, WI. ICE described these flyers as fake. Before the 2016 election, an image circulated on social media appearing to show an immigration officer arresting someone at a polling place. This image was a hoax. ICE will not patrol or conduct law enforcement operations at polling places, according to the federal agency. PolitiFact has found that claims about ICE agents patrolling polling places are false. Facebook has flagged posts with this claim as part of its effort to combat false news and information on its News Feed. Intimidation at the polls has been a recurring problem in American history, but it is rarer today. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 included provisions against intimidation, threats, or coercion at the polls. Some sections of the Voting Rights Act were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 in the case Shelby County v. Holder, but the sections including protections against voter intimidation have not been invalidated. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 includes similar voter protections. Voters that feel harassed or intimidated at the polls, or that see flyers or other advertisements that claim to be from ICE, can report them several ways.

    "content": "Mail-in ballots that meet eligibility and validity requirements are counted in every election. The law requires all valid votes to be counted in every election regardless of how they are cast. State laws vary on how voters can cast ballots. Generally, voters can cast ballots in person during early voting or on Election Day, or through the mail. Voting by mail is also known as “absentee” voting. In almost all states, voters who are concerned about the coronavirus pandemic are eligible to request a mail-in ballot from their election officials or will receive one automatically. Due to COVID-related concerns, voters in some states will be automatically mailed a mail ballot application to encourage you to vote that way. Voters must be registered to vote to request and cast a mail-in ballot. You can check your voter registration status at canivote.org. Ballots cast in person during early voting or on Election Day are validated for eligibility when the voter checks in to vote. A poll worker determines the voter’s status on the spot. The validation of mail-in ballots happens after they are returned by the voter. The ballot envelope typically requires a voter’s signature or other identifying information. Election officials check to make sure that the ballot signature matches that voter’s signature on file. The mail-in ballot also must be postmarked, received by an election official, or both, by a date set in state law. Once validated, the ballot is separated from its envelope and sorted for counting. It can take local election officials more time to count a larger than normal number of mail-in ballots. These extra validation and processing steps mean that reported mail-in ballot totals are not complete by the evening on Election Day. All election night totals are unofficial, and this was true even in past years. When election results are certified as official, they include all valid ballots cast during the election, including those submitted by mail. This year, many voters will choose to cast their ballots by mail due to concerns about COVID-19. A higher percentage of ballots cast by mail means that it will take more time for election officials to carefully process and count all votes than in previous presidential elections. Voters should not expect results on election night. A delay in results does not mean that fraudulent votes are being counted. Instead, it means that election officials and volunteers are being careful and ensuring that the counting process is accurate.",

    "content": "COVID-19 will still be with us in November. Since a vaccine is not expected to be ready until at least 2021, here are our recommendations about how to safely cast your ballots during the general election. While Election Day is the “first Tuesday next after the first Monday in November,” it actually represents the last day that you can vote in most states. With absentee and early voting options, voting will start weeks earlier. No matter what, voters can cast their ballots in ways that can keep them safe and comfortable this November. One of the best ways to vote safely is by using a mail ballot. If voting by mail or by absentee is an option for you in your state, doing so may be the best way to keep you and your community safe from COVID-19. All states have their own policies for by-mail voting methods, so it is crucial to do your research before casting your ballot. Prior to this year, there were five vote-by-mail states, meaning that they sent a ballot in the mail to all voters before each election without requiring them to submit a request. In addition to those five, at least three more, plus the District of Columbia, will automatically send ballots to all active voters for this November election. Twenty-nine additional states have no-excuse absentee voting, meaning a voter can request an absentee ballot through the mail without needing an excuse. While 16 states require an excuse for voting by mail, many have expanded the list of acceptable reasons to include “fear of getting COVID,” making it easier for voters to have this as an option. Keep in mind the requirements in your state for returning your ballot, as some states require a notary or two witnesses. In-person voting options will be available for most voters. Voting by mail is safe and secure, but it does not work for everyone. Some voters need in-person voting for accessibility reasons, or they simply prefer voting at a polling place. Election administrators across the nation are working hard to make in-person voting options safe and accessible. If your state has early voting, you may experience fewer people and shorter lines at the polls during this period before Election Day. It not only reduces exposure, but it also prevents overwhelming the system on Election Day. On March 27, 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump. It allocated $400 million to states to help administer voting during the pandemic. Much of this funding is being used for cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment for voting sites and poll workers, which can give voters peace of mind. You can do your part as well in minimizing the spread of coronavirus while voting. If you plan to vote in person, whether early or on Election Day, wear a mask covering your nose and mouth, consider bringing hand sanitizer or disposable gloves, and practice social distancing by standing six feet apart from your&hellip;",

    "content": "On July 9, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security and the Executive Office for Immigration Review released a proposed rule that would give both agencies increased authority to restrict asylum access at the U.S. border. The rule proposes classifying asylum-seekers coming from a place where a contagious or infectious disease is prevalent as a threat to the national security to the United States. Like the Title 42 order issued by the Department of Health and Human Services in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control in March 2020 regarding COVID-19, the July 9 proposed rule represents an additional lever the White House hopes to pull to further limit asylum access for migrants coming to the United States. While public health experts have urged HHS and the CDC to withdraw policies that bar entry to asylum-seekers on public health grounds, the new rule would not only expand the public health authorities to restrict asylum, but also blur the line between DHS and HHS authorities regarding health issues, further complicating border management and asylum processes. According to DHS and EOIR, the rule proposes that both agencies may consider emergency public health concerns based on communicable diseases as potential threats to national security when making asylum determinations. Should they find reasonable grounds for determining that an asylum-seeker poses a danger to the security of the United States based on public health concerns, a migrant would be ineligible for asylum or the protection of withholding of removal in the United States. Via the proposed rule, DHS and EOIR plan to make four reforms to the U.S. immigration system by: Clarifying that the “danger to the security of the United States” bars to eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal apply in the context of public health emergencies related to the possible threat of introduction or further spread of international pandemics into the United States. Making these security bars applicable in credible fear screenings in the expedited removal process so that migrants subject to the bars can be expeditiously removed. Streamlining the screening for deferral of removal eligibility1 under the Convention Against Torture in the expedited removal process to allow for the expedited removal of individuals ineligible for deferral. Restoring DHS&#8217;s discretion to either place migrants ineligible for asylum pursuant to public health grounds into regular, formal removal proceedings in immigration court, or remove them to third countries where they would not face persecution or torture. While migrants would still have the opportunity to apply for protections in the U.S. under the Convention Against Torture, the proposed rule would also allow DHS to remove people applying for such protections to safe third countries to pursue relief there. The rule’s finalization2 would allow DHS to bar migrants with certain communicable diseases, or who come from a country or region where such a disease is prevalent, and the migrant may have come in contact with the disease. Specifically, the rule would give the agency authority to bar asylum-seekers on grounds of any possible or potential threat to&hellip;",

As policymakers consider what further action may be necessary, these eight charts provide important context for the status of student loan debt today. Since 2007, the balance of federal student loan debt has more than doubled in real terms—from $658 billion to $1.54 trillion. At the same time, the number of loan recipients has grown from 28.3 million to 42.6 million, a 51% increase. Source: National Student Loan Data System, Federal Student Loan Portfolio, 2020 Note: Loan debt is measured in 2020 dollars and includes outstanding principal and interest balance for all federal student loans. Fiscal Year 2020 data are from Q2. All other years use Q4 totals. Recipients are an unduplicated count of recipients of federal student loans. In most cases, this is the borrower, except in the case of Parent PLUS loans where the parent is the borrower and the child the recipient. The majority (83%) of outstanding federal student loan debt is lent directly by the federal government. These Direct Loans stand in contrast to Federal Family Educational Loans, which are generally held by banks or other private financial institutions and backed by the federal government, and Perkins Loans, which are subsidized by the federal government but generally held by colleges and limited to borrowers with exceptional financial need. FFEL and Perkins loans have been discontinued, meaning that all new federal student loan issuance takes the form of Direct Loans. Source: National Student Loan Data System, Federal Student Loan Portfolio, 2020 Note: Total does not equal 100% due to rounding. Data are most recent available (2020 Q2). Direct Loans carry the most robust protections for borrowers, including access to multiple income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness. These protections have been expanded during COVID-19, as Congress suspended interest accruals and monthly payments on loans held by the federal government until September 30, 2020. Unfortunately, this support was not offered to the more than 8 million FFEL and Perkins Loan borrowers whose loans are owned by private lenders and schools. While some private lenders are offering loan relief, most students with private loans will continue to see their interest accrue. Despite large increases in total cumulative lending, most borrowers (55%) owe less than $20,000, with 76% owing less than $40,000. Source: Enterprise Data Warehouse, Federal Student Loan Portfolio, 2020 Note: Cumulative debt includes outstanding principal and interest balances. Data are most recent available (2020 Q2). At the other end of the distribution, 7% of borrowers have balances of $100,000 or more and collectively hold 37% of total outstanding debt. These high-balance borrowers tend to have debt from expensive graduate programs.

    "content": "In July, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador visited President Trump to celebrate the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The visit occurred a year after U.S. threats to impose tariffs on Mexico led both countries to use border crackdowns and ad-hoc policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols to deter the arrival of Central American families seeking asylum in the United States. Although this approach reduced migration to the U.S.-Mexico border, its reliance on Mexico and the Northern Triangle governments to implement it failed to create a meaningful framework for managing migration in the region. In spite of his, a restart of the relationship is possible, and the discussions between the administrations of Mexican President Vincente Fox and President George W. Bush offer a Biden administration or second Trump term a smarter – and more realistic – long-term approach to U.S.-Mexico cooperation on migration because it treated immigration as a part of the region’s economic landscape needing management, not as an aberration needing control. The discussions, which started in 2001 to manage the historic irregular flow of Mexican migrants into the United States, sought to create a framework that would forge a “new and realistic approaches to migration to ensure it is safe, orderly, legal and dignified.” For instance, the plan explored the possibility of creating a temporary worker program that matched Mexican nationals with U.S. employers needing workers. Although the Bush administration was wary of legalizing the undocumented, the two countries contemplated regularization that would allow undocumented immigrants to legally work in the United States and access certain benefits such as driver’s licenses and Social Security cards. Although Presidents Fox and Bush held a successful summit on these issues in early September 2001, the tragic events of the September 11th attacks led the United States to abandon these talks and focus on overhauling the immigration system’s national security components to prevent future attacks. Despite the necessity of these national security reforms, this pivot leaves historians to wonder whether these talks would have improved migration management in the region. The discussion’s proposals weren’t perfect. For instance, its emphasis on regularization of undocumented immigrants isn’t a viable alternative to true legalization. These immigrants, many of whom have lived in the United States for decades, deserve the opportunity to become full-fledged members of their community, including having the chance to eventually pursue citizenship. Furthermore, a viable migration system that promotes the economic movement of migrants within the region must address permanent employment-based migration and not just temporary work visas, especially for migrants who can fulfill long-term labor market demands in the U.S. and want to settle in the United States permanently. Furthermore, the discussions addressed economic-based Mexican migration to the United States without considering how these patterns can change over time. In 2018 and 2019, Central American families seeking asylum became the primary group traveling to the border, reversing long-term patterns where single Mexican men traveled to the U.S. seeking work. More migrants have also sought humanitarian protection in Mexico in recent years.&hellip;",

    "content": "There is an opportunity to use the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 crisis to implement thoughtful solutions for rebuilding and recharging the U.S. economy. Addressing the country’s immediate public health and economic needs remains the top priority at present, but policymakers should consider beginning now to set the stage for long-term recovery by developing strategies that integrate economic and climate objectives. This paper argues that such strategies should include meaningful investment in research, development, demonstration, and commercial deployment activities to advance direct air capture (DAC) technology. As a complement to reducing new emissions, the ability to remove carbon dioxide that is already in the atmosphere—including through DAC—will likely be necessary to achieve climate goals. At the same time, investments in energy and climate innovation will be critical to the nation’s long-term economic growth, technology leadership, and global competitiveness. As with other high-potential, high-impact technologies, federal action in the early stages of DAC development can play a pivotal role in helping this nascent industry improve efficiency, reduce costs, and grow markets. Congress first dedicated funding for the advancement of DAC technologies as part of FY 2020 appropriations. The funding, $35 million for R&amp;D efforts by the Department of Energy, will be spread across multiple DOE offices and represents a significant step forward in federal support for DAC. In light of the recent economic downturn, however, in addition to appropriation funding, other federal investment is needed to support the full innovation lifecycle for DAC technology and to realize associated jobs benefits. An analysis by the Rhodium Group found that the build out and operation of a single DAC plant with the capacity to capture 1 million tons of carbon dioxide per year would create more than 3,400 jobs, with nearly 300 of these jobs associated with the operation and maintenance of the completed facility. A DAC industry would support high-quality jobs in steel, cement, chemicals, industrial equipment manufacturing, construction, engineering, and electric power, among others. One of the reasons that the European DAC company Climeworks has grown is because it received considerable innovation funding from the European Union (including from EU Horizon 2020 and incubators). Similar to Europe and past U.S. innovation investments that have generated strong economic returns and energy savings, the federal government should continue to fund technologies that can provide new market opportunities for U.S. innovators, entrepreneurs, and heavy industry. This includes leveraging a wide array of resources, including the National Science Foundation’s Engineering Research Centers to advance DAC technology. Congress should consider the following funding proposals for early-stage DAC R&amp;D: Appropriate an additional $20 million over five years for the NSF Engineering Research Centers and an additional $44 million over five years for grants and cooperative agreements through the NSF to support very early stage research by drawing in new talent and ideas to address current shortcomings with DAC technology1. This would help ensure that the foundational needs of a U.S. DAC industry are supported, particularly with the engagement of new professionals and additional stakeholders through well-established government&hellip;",

    "content": "Negotiations over the next round of COVID-19 relief have zeroed in on unemployment insurance, and specifically, what to do about the supplemental $600 weekly benefit that expired last week. A closer look at the data reveals that the negotiators on both sides have a leg to stand on. A six-month extension of the weekly supplement at $600 would mean that lower-income workers in nearly every state would continue to collect close to or more than twice as much as their counterparts who remain in the workforce. Lawmakers should instead aim to gradually phase down the supplemental benefit as economic and health conditions improve. On the other hand, renewing the additional benefits at only $200 per week right now would mean a significant overnight income drop for millions of households across the country, even while the pandemic continues to rage. With more than 30 million displaced workers currently relying on UI and America’s health and economic outlook highly uncertain, the additional federal weekly benefit provides critical support. It has also prevented the bottom from dropping out of the U.S. economy. The Congressional Budget Office, however, estimates that 5 out of 6 unemployed workers would make more on UI than from returning to work if the $600 is extended in its current form. To make this even more complicated, each state sets its own formula for the standard UI program (excluding the $600 supplement) to determine the portion of wages that are replaced. Wages also vary considerably state by state. The median worker in New Jersey makes $896 a week, compared to $530 in Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico or West Virginia. As a result, the flat $600 federal supplement caused total UI benefit levels to generate very different wage replacement rates across the country. So, how does the federal government continue to supplement weekly unemployment benefits without disincentivizing work? To help answer this question, BPC used data from the University of Chicago’s Unemployment Insurance Calculator to calculate benefit replacement rates for low-income (25th percentile), median-income (50th percentile), and high-income (75th percentile), UI-eligible unemployed workers in each state under four different federal weekly benefit supplement levels: $0, $200, $400, and $600.1 194 As Table 1 shows, allowing the federal supplement to expire has resulted in a dramatic adjustment to weekly benefit levels, with wage replacement rates declining by roughly 90 percentage points for the typical worker. A blanket extension of the $600 weekly supplement, however, would result in the typical unemployed worker continuing to earn substantially more on UI than from their previous job. Digging deeper, Table 2 contains unemployment benefit replacement rates for the median-income worker in each state, and illustrates considerable differences across the country. Indeed, failing to renew any federal supplement would result in more than a 100 percentage point decline in the wage replacement rate for median-income workers in several states, including Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, in states like Kentucky, Maine, New Mexico, and North Carolina, keeping the $600 supplement would mean that losing a job continues&hellip;",

    "content": "With the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States hitting new records each day, the importance of developing a vaccine is clearer than ever. A safe, effective, and widely available vaccine is necessary to protect lives, restore our economy, and enable everyone to get back to a sense of normalcy. There are currently more than 155 possible vaccines being developed globally with 23 currently in human trials.1 Congress has appropriated nearly $10 billion to fund vaccine efforts, and the administration has established Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to coordinate and finance vaccine2 research with the goal of having 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine for COVID-19 by January 2021. As part of this effort, OWS has awarded almost $4 billion to six pharmaceutical companies working on a vaccine and recently signed a contract with Pfizer and a German biotechnology company to pay $1.95 billion for 500 million doses of their vaccine if it proves safe and effective.3 Several vaccine candidates have demonstrated promising safety and efficacy results in small studies. This summer and fall they will be tested in phase 3 clinical trials, meaning that thousands of volunteers, reflective of the general population, will receive a vaccine to further assess safety and effectiveness. The Food and Drug Administration has stated that any vaccine candidate would need to be at least 50% more effective than placebo in preventing COVID-19 prior to receiving approval.4 These are the first steps. To successfully combat this virus, policymakers will need to establish a comprehensive national COVID-19 vaccine plan that considers the necessary steps for each of these components: 1) vaccine development (safety and efficacy); 2) production; 3) distribution and prioritization; 4) cost; and 5) public education. There is bipartisan support for such an effort. As the work on this front continues, Congress and the administration should take the following insights into consideration: Vaccine Development: Safety and Efficacy: While everyone feels the urgency of having a vaccine as quickly as possible, it is critical that safety and efficacy trials not be rushed. Under normal circumstances, vaccine development takes 10-15 years5 and even the fastest vaccine developed to date, the mumps vaccine, took four years.6. Typically phase 3 trials take years to complete and test thousands of individuals with the goal of catching adverse events even if they are rare or take time to develop. Yet leading scientists and researchers are talking seriously about developing the COVID-19 vaccine within 12-18 months. But even with the critical need, it is important that the science not be rushed to meet a political deadline. Even in a best-case scenario, vaccinating the broader U.S. population will be a 2021, not 2020, endeavor. Vaccine Production: Vaccine production is exacting and expensive. Individual vaccines require specific infrastructure to ensure safety throughout the manufacturing process.7 In addition, given the sheer number of people who will need the vaccine, the production challenges are considerable. To help address some of those challenges, OWS has committed to scaling up production for selected vaccine candidates before&hellip;",

    "content": "As the country continues to grapple with increasing COVID-19 cases and the resulting educational, economic, and health impacts, important changes are needed to strengthen both school meals and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In order to maintain and strengthen access to food assistance programs during the pandemic, which are a lifeline for struggling Americans, school meal programs need extended waivers and increased flexibilities that allow meals to be served through multiple programs and locations. SNAP benefit levels should also be increased and barriers to accessing benefits removed. When the wave of school closures began, millions of students who rely on school meal programs were left without access to meals they could previously count on. In response to the gap in meal services, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued important waivers to allow schools to provide students with healthy meals through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the Seamless Summer Option (SSO) and to allow meals to be served outside of the standard group setting to support social distancing. SFSP and SSO allow schools, local governments, and community organizations to serve free meals to children in need every summer. This coming school year, officials will likely need to rely more heavily on these programs as many schools will utilize virtual learning or staggered schedules to keep students safe. That’s why it is critical that USDA extend waivers that allow schools to serve students while adhering to recommended COVID-19 safety measures. Federal policy changes are needed to bolster access to school meals during modified school schedules this fall. How USDA can help: Allow schools to continue utilizing SFSP and SSO throughout 2020-2021 school year. A vaccine for COVID-19 is not expected until sometime in 2021, so it’s likely that in many communities across the country there will be at least part-time virtual learning. Without an extension to the SFSP and SSO, schools will be largely reliant on the National School Lunch and the School Breakfast program. While these programs are important, they are designed to provide meals at school during the school day. If USDA does not extend the SFSP and SSO waiver there could be a significant increase in administrative burden for schools to process applications and identify eligible students. The higher SFSP reimbursement rate can help schools continue serving consistent meals, while avoiding the stigma associated with identifying students eligible for free and reduced-price meals in the National School Lunch and the School Breakfast Program. Include SFSP and SSO in the non-congregate waiver. This waiver eliminated the requirement that National School Lunch and the School Breakfast Program meals be provided in group settings given the need for social distancing due to COVID-19. This flexibility has allowed school districts to develop food service processes to fit their community’s needs. For example, many districts organized grab-and-go sites and school bus delivery services.Expanding the non-congregate waiver to include the Summer Food Service Program and the Seamless Summer Option will allow non-school sponsors, such as local government and community organizations, to&hellip;",

    "content": "The new BPC-Morning Consult poll released last week suggests that racial minorities are underrepresented among current unemployment insurance recipients. An analysis of unemployed workers who were screened by Morning Consult—including those omitted from the sample because they are not receiving UI benefits—reveals that this is due, in part, to striking racial disparities in the approval rates of UI claims. Specifically, this analysis suggests Black and Hispanic workers are significantly less likely to be approved for benefits than white workers. The new evidence comes in addition to what we already know: communities of color are disproportionately bearing the brunt of job loss, experiencing significant financial hardship, and struggling to afford necessities, such as food and rent, during the pandemic. Table 1 compares the racial distribution of all unemployed workers in June 2020 to the BPC-Morning Consult sample of UI recipients1. 191 While some of the disparity found in our analysis may be attributable to the survey sample, a gap such as that in Table 1 suggests that the racial composition of UI recipients may skew white and underrepresent Black and Hispanic workers. While white workers accounted for 50% of unemployed workers in June 2020, they made up 78% of the BPC-Morning Consult sample of UI recipients at around the same time frame. Meanwhile, Hispanic workers represented 23% of the unemployed population but just 10% of the sample of UI recipients, and Black workers accounted for 16% of the currently unemployed but only 9% of the sample of UI recipients. To understand why the BPC-Morning Consult poll of UI recipients underrepresented workers of color, Morning Consult provided data from the outreach of the survey. The poll focused on workers receiving UI benefits, and therefore excluded workers whose claims have been rejected. Morning Consult typically does not collect data on individuals excluded from a poll, but after noticing a high frequency of unemployed workers not receiving UI benefits, they began to collect demographic information on workers who reported that their UI claims were rejected. The result is a sample of 1,222 unemployed workers polled between June 23 and July 7, 2020, who stated that their UI claims received eligibility determinations and were either approved (and included in the main poll) or rejected (and excluded from the main poll).2 Overall, based on the information respondents provided, UI claims by Black and Hispanic workers that received an eligibility determination were substantially less likely to be approved than those by white workers. Only 58% of UI claims by Black respondents were approved, compared to 78% of those from white respondents. Hispanic workers were also considerably less likely to be approved for UI benefits than white workers, with a 69% approval rate. This analysis suggests that the population of UI recipients could underrepresent workers of color, in part, because their claims have a lower approval rate than those of white workers. 192 Even as UI is providing crucial financial relief to tens of millions of dislocated workers, it appears that the program may be rejecting claims at&hellip;",

    "content": "As the negative economic impacts of COVID-19 have led to state budget shortfalls and limited resources for state Medicaid programs, federal strategies that advance comprehensive, patient-centered primary care in Medicaid are more critical than ever. Primary care improves health outcomes and prevents more costly care over the long-term for this population. To address this issue, BPC released a new report with federal policy recommendations to advance comprehensive primary care in Medicaid. Amid the pandemic, these recommendations have broader implications for addressing access to care, resources for states, and health inequities exacerbated by COVID-19. State budget shortfalls over the next two years could total an estimated $555 billion, and shortfalls in 2021 could exceed any year of the Great Recession. Governors must sustain state operations with less resources, while managing the state’s pandemic response. As Medicaid spending accounts for about 20% of states’ general funds, states often cut Medicaid spending during periods of economic decline by: (1) cutting eligibility; (2) cutting optional benefits; or (3) cutting payments to providers, many of whom are struggling financially during COVID-19. In effect, during a pandemic when access to affordable health insurance coverage is most vital, individuals could lose access to coverage or services. Although Congress has provided temporary aid to states through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)—and conditioned that aid on states maintaining eligibility standards, coverage, premiums, and cost-sharing protections—states still face competing demands on their limited resources that may compel Medicaid spending cuts and disrupt improvements to primary care. Additional immediate financial assistance to states would help tremendously, but the pandemic has made clear that states will also need long-term financial support, policy changes, and federal guidance to implement programs and services that improve health through primary care. Federal financial support for primary care transformation initiatives would improve access to comprehensive primary care. BPC recommends that Congress appropriate $120 million in funding for the Primary Care Extension Program. This appropriation would support competitive grants to states for the establishment of state- or multistate-level Hubs that would work with local entities to: assist primary care providers in implementing patient-centered medical homes; support primary care learning communities; participate in a national network of Hubs; and plan for financial sustainability. Congress should also direct the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to promote the measurement and reporting of primary care spending in states. This data would help develop evidence for primary care investment and uncover potential long-term savings. COVID-19 has led to an estimated 5.4 million workers becoming uninsured. Incentivizing non-expansion states to adopt Medicaid expansion would improve access to affordable health insurance coverage for up to almost 5 million people and likely reduce revenue shortfalls in those states. While Oklahoma voters adopted Medicaid expansion during the pandemic, addressing barriers to Medicaid expansion will encourage adoption among the remaining non-expansion states. Non-expansion states do not have the same financial incentives as the early expansion states that received a higher federal match. BPC recommends that Congress permit the remaining non-expansion states to expand Medicaid&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic collapse have put pressure on state unemployment insurance (UI) systems, many of which do not have adequate reserves to finance an unprecedented increase in benefit claims. Although some state funds are at risk of being depleted, there is little reason to fear that states will be unable to finance benefits in the near future. This is because UI allows states to borrow from the federal government and then automatically adjusts payroll taxes on employers to pay back the debt. A bigger challenge is states’ inability to administer benefits effectively, a problem that must be addressed in order to protect vulnerable Americans from the continued economic fallout of the coronavirus as well as future economic downturns. UI operates as a federal-state partnership, providing temporary cash support to unemployed workers and thereby mitigating the impact of recessions. The program is financed through separate federal and state payroll taxes collected on employers. These revenues are held in trust funds by the U.S. Treasury Department. Each state administers its own system and is responsible for the majority of the costs. States have broad discretion over the tax regimes that finance their respective programs, the design of their program benefits, and the computer systems that run them; they are also not subject to trust fund reserve requirements. This flexibility leads to major differences across states in terms of the generosity of benefits offered, the efficiency of benefit delivery, and the extent to which trust funds have adequate resources to pay out benefits during a recession. The onset of COVID-19 has illuminated these stark differences, as some states struggle to administer benefits effectively, and others are seeing a depletion of their trust fund resources. Prior to the pandemic, 22 states and jurisdictions were flagged by the Department of Labor for having insufficient trust fund reserves to support UI claims during a recession. Now that we may be in the midst of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, many of these states (and potentially more) will require a loan to continue paying benefits. States can borrow from the federal government to shore up their trust funds and repay their debt over an extended time period. Alternatively, states can borrow from the private market. Interest accrues daily on the federal loans, and the Treasury Department applies any excess payroll taxes collected by states to this debt. If a given state still owes money to the federal government after roughly two years, the state moves into what is called a “credit reduction state,” which leads to an increase in the effective federal payroll tax rate on employers, generating additional revenue to pay down the state’s debt. Specifically, the federal government finances its portion of the UI system through a 6% payroll tax on employers on the first $7,000 of each worker’s wages. Under normal circumstances, however, employers are eligible for a tax credit that reduces the effective tax rate to 0.6%, provided they follow the federal rules that dictate the jobs&hellip;",

Over the last few months, while many of us practiced social distancing and adhered to stay-at-home orders, essential workers worked around the clock to make sure we all have access to water, transit options, electricity, and internet service. Others ensured groceries and medicines were in stock and that our hospitals and healthcare workers had the protective equipment they needed. However, providing these essential services has devastatingly put these workers at disproportionate risk of contracting COVID-19. For example, across the country, one focus has been on the alarming number of transit system workers who contracted the virus and even died. Just in April, New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority had 68 fatalities among its employees. Nearly 2,500 MTA employees tested positive for the virus and more than 4,000 needed to quarantine, which also led to staffing shortages. All these sectors have had to adjust to accommodate social distancing and safety concerns, confront worker absenteeism, and generally and dramatically alter the way they do business. These sectors have also seen dramatic revenue losses—the result of plummeting transit ridership, household financial hardships that have led to missed bill payments, and declining sales and income tax revenue. According to Politico, the MTA is burning through $200 million every week during the coronavirus pandemic. Ridership plummeted over 90%, resulting in a $700-800 million loss in monthly revenue. The MTA received an initial $3.9 billion in aid in the federal government’s first stimulus package but most of that money is already gone, and the MTA is projecting a $16.2 billion deficit through fiscal year 2024. San Francisco has similarly seen a ridership decline and the agency predicts a $568 million drop in revenue over the next four years which has led to the suspension of half of the city’s bus lines. Many energy and water utilities put into place moratoriums on service disconnections (voluntarily or as a result of state orders) to protect customers, however any resulting nonpayment risks diminishing their ability to maintain operations and implement new worker safety procedures. Given COVID-19&#8217;s dramatic impact on these critical infrastructure systems and, in turn, their importance to our economy, public health, and safety, it is more important than ever before to understand the current and future needs of our essential workers, particularly as local economies reopen and face spikes in COVID-cases. Below is a description of the unique workforce challenges each of these three sectors are facing, and which may be exacerbated by COVID-19, and our panelists’ perspectives and recommendations to protect essential workers through the crisis and invest in them once the immediate public health threat diminishes.

BPC presented the Legislative Action Awards to Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Tina Smith (D-MN), and Reps. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and Garret Graves (R-LA).  “Throughout my tenure, I witnessed firsthand how they have in the authentic spirit of the Patriot Award, personified the highest values and purpose of public service”, said former Sen. Olympia Snowe, a BPC board member, as she presented the awards to Alexander and Murray.  “We need everyone committed to putting our constituents first and finding meaningful solutions,” said Murray, recognizing the importance of bipartisanship amid a national crisis.  Alexander added, “For me, bipartisanship is a tactic, not the goal. My goal as a United States Senator is the result.”  Former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele, a former chair of the Republican National Committee and current BPC board member, presented Senators Cassidy and Smith with the Legislative Action Awards. This was followed by a lively discussion with BPC President Jason Grumet on the future of bipartisanship and what is needed to push the country forward.   “I think the kind of fallacy of bipartisanship is that you have to give up your conservative or liberal values in order to achieve what is best for the country,” said Cassidy.   Meanwhile, Smith made a convincing case for bipartisanship: “It is hard to do bipartisan work. It is easier to stay in your corner and talk about how bad the other guys are, but at the end of the day that’s just talk, not action.” Smith and Cassidy also discussed the next coronavirus relief bill and issue areas that have received bipartisan support, namely supporting the child care system.   BPC’s newest board member, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, presented Murphy and Graves with the Legislative Action Awards. Castro spoke of the urgency of working together.   “The work of the BPC and of the folks that we’re recognizing tonight is so necessary right now. During this time of national emergency, we need Congress to come together and find solutions,” he said, while noting their efforts to bridge the partisan gap around climate change in particular.   Graves talked about the importance of shedding partisan labels, “The parties prevent us from being able to have dialogue with folks on the other side of the aisle, but I think it’s absolutely critical that we do.”   As one of the first two participants in BPC’s American Congressional Exchange, Murphy said, “These trips are incredibly important on a personal level… but also to see one another’s districts and we  were able to get tangible bipartisan policy into law.”  At the end of the event, Grumet said, “My hope is that today’s discussion gives you all some optimism about the incredibly talented people working in our government who are striving every day to make it work for the American people.” ",

    "content": "In July 2020, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that students who are enrolled in strictly online curricula due to COVID-19 for the fall semester would have to return to their home countries or transfer to a school offering in-person or hybrid curricula. The Trump administration later rescinded the announcement after Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sued the U.S. government, arguing that the rule change represented an “arbitrary and capricious” action in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act. Both the announcement and its reversal came suddenly, just weeks before the first day of the fall semester. If the policy had been successfully implemented, it could have forced thousands of international students to leave midway through their academic pursuits in the United States. Creating such an environment of undue pressure could hinder individuals from taking their merits from the classroom to our labor markets, ultimately having consequences for our economy, especially for the COVID-19 recovery. According to the Institute of International Education, approximately 136,000 undergraduate foreign students are about to enter their junior and senior years of college for the 2020-2021 academic year, the majority of them in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields. Additionally, the bulk of international students self-fund their education in the United States. In the 2018-19 academic year, 83.5% of international undergraduate students’ university costs were paid for by the students or their family members, rather than through scholarships or financial aid. Policy uncertainty for international students may drive them to find other countries that provide a more viable option for their educational needs. The new foreign student enrollment rate for the 2020-2021 academic year is already projected to decline anywhere from 63% to 98% since 2018-2019 academic year, the lowest since World War II. Capricious policy change announcements that create an unstable environment for the international student body and hinder their pursuit of academic study in the United States could lead to lower future enrollment rates of foreign students in U.S. institutions, impacting university and college finances. Declining student enrollment rates could also have major impacts on valuable research fields since the majority of international students engage in STEM programs of study. For example, in the 2018-19 academic year, 230,780 foreign students graduated with an engineering degree, 203,461 with a math or computer science degree, and 182,170 with a business and management degree. These were the top three areas of study for foreign students. Recent studies suggest that significant reductions in international students in the United States could hamper the commitment to research of United States academic institutions, where a significant portion of these students participate, and may impede universities’ continued contribution to research and development in the STEM fields. According to Student and Exchange Visitor Information System data on foreign student employer records, from 2008 to 2018 the 10 companies that hired the most students on STEM optional practical training were technology-based (Figure 1). Companies often hire foreign students for innovative research and technological advancement that benefits the United States. Since 2007,&hellip;",

Many workers lack options aside from unemployment insurance (UI) for balancing caregiving responsibilities with their jobs. A quarter of UI recipients—roughly 8 million workers—primarily spend their time caregiving, and caregiving is the primary barrier to reemployment among parents on UI who are not looking for a job. As the nation grapples with reopening, Congress can better support workers’ engagement in the labor force and their caregiving responsibilities. Survey Parameters: Morning Consult surveyed 1,500 persons receiving unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was fielded on June 19, 2020 – July 6, 2020. 1. Most workers receiving unemployment insurance were furloughed or fired, but of those who quit their jobs, caregiving responsibilities were a primary reason. Most workers receiving UI benefits were either furloughed (35%) or laid off (37%). Only 6% of workers on UI report quitting their jobs during the pandemic. Of the workers who quit their jobs, caregiving needs related to school and child care closures were a leading reason why, behind fear of illness and job dissatisfaction. 52% of parents who quit did so due to child care provider or school closures 37% of caregivers who quit did so to care for a sick family member 20% of workers who quit did so due to other caregiving responsibilities 2. Workers on unemployment insurance are facing unprecedented caregiving responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregiving responsibilities have grown or stayed the same for 95% of unemployed workers during the pandemic, and 78% of parents on UI reported an increase in caregiving. Caregiving demands have grown at relatively similar levels across income levels, education levels, and ethnicities, though some disparities remain. Time spent caregiving rose for 39% of women compared to 32% of men Time spent caregiving rose for 47% of Hispanic and 42% of Black recipients, compared to 34% of white recipients While looking for work is the primary activity of most unemployed persons, 26% of all UI recipients (roughly 8 million workers) primarily spend their time caregiving, including 59% of parents and 29% of those not actively looking for work. 3. Many workers lack options aside from unemployment insurance for balancing caregiving responsibilities and workforce participation Nearly a half (44%) of UI recipients report that they are not actively looking for work or have declined an offer to return to work. Of these workers, caregiving is a major barrier to reentering the labor force. Of parents not looking to return to work, a majority (59%) cite caregiving responsibilities as the primary barrier to employment. Of parents not looking to return to work, caregiving specifically due to school closures is the top reason why (41%). Caregiving responsibilities due to school closures are particularly pronounced among minority parents: 55% of Hispanic and 44% of Black parents on UI are not planning to or did not accept an offer to return to work due to caregiving needs.

    "content": "“Nearly two out of three workers (63%) say they would be somewhat (29%) or very (34%) likely to return to work sooner if they knew they had access to paid family leave.” A key finding of our recent Bipartisan Policy Center &#8211; Morning Consult poll of Americans on unemployment insurance was that paid leave would help workers meet unprecedented caregiving demands and transition back to work. As such, paid leave should be a core part of the next stimulus package. When the pandemic struck, many workers found they lacked options for balancing their work and caregiving responsibilities, resulting in some going on unemployment insurance. While most workers receiving UI benefits were either furloughed (35%) or laid off (37%), 6% quit their jobs and caregiving needs related to school and child care closures were the leading reason why, behind fear of illness and job dissatisfaction. Shockingly &#8211; though perhaps less so for anyone with children trying to balance work &#8211; the majority (52%) of parents who quit their jobs during the pandemic did so due to child care provider or school closures. Additionally, 37% of caregivers who quit did so to care for a sick family member and 20% of workers who quit did so due to other caregiving responsibilities. While Congress put in place paid leave for workers with caregiving responsibilities through the Families First Act, preserving the crucial connection between employer and employee instead of necessitating unemployment, our survey suggests that access to these provisions was far from widespread. The vast majority of workers (94%) currently on UI did not know or have the option of using paid leave from their employer during COVID-19, including those at firms with under 500 employees that were required to provide paid leave under the emergency leave provisions of the Families First Act. Additionally, workers at larger companies not covered by the paid leave provisions appear to have fared worse, with those previously employed by a company with 500+ employees 12 percentage points more likely than those at a company with less than 500 employees to have claimed UI because they were laid off or furloughed, though there are likely numerous reasons impacting this finding. Without new options on the table, caregiving responsibilities will continue to challenge parents’ ability to return to work, especially for minorities and women. While looking for work is the primary activity of most unemployed persons, 26% of all UI recipients (roughly 8 million workers) primarily spend their time caregiving, including 59% of parents and 29% of those not actively looking for work. Nearly half of UI recipients (44%) report that they are not actively looking for work or have declined on offer to return to work, and caregiving is a huge reason why. Paid leave can help to provide a way out of this trap. Wider access to paid leave is vital for creating the necessary flexibility for caregivers and workers amidst continuing school, child, and adult care closures, and intermittent reopenings.

    "content": "As fall quickly approaches, difficult questions about the K-12 school year loom for parents, policymakers, and school administrators. The nation must weigh the academic and social benefits of in-person instruction with the health risks that students and teachers face if they return to classrooms. But discussions about reopening schools must also consider that schools serve an important function beyond academics. Schools serve as child care for working parents. Preliminary reopening plans include many blends of in-person and online instruction to mitigate viral transmission. Some major school districts have already opted for full online learning. But for parents unable to work from home, most of whom are low-income workers, caring for children during periods of distanced learning will not be feasible. And for those privileged to work remotely, the need for child care has not faltered and is only likely to grow as children require increased educational support. Over 23 million working parents with school-age children and no at-home caregiver will look to child care providers for the support they need to return to work and help their children learn1. However, this will be a daunting task for a child care system that was fragile prior to COVID-19 and received insufficient funding to sustain itself through the height of the pandemic. The following is an outline of the ways our nation’s child care industry can serve as a mechanism to ensure parents can continue working among periodic outbreaks and various school reopening policies this fall. State and local officials, school leaders, and even members of Congress must ensure that a robust plan for child care access is a part of any plan to reopen schools. In the discussion around K-12 reopening, policymakers and school officials agree that children need to continue learning this fall, but the physical reopening of schools, as with any large gathering of people, poses risks for COVID-19 transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention school reopening guidance indicates that schools can reduce risk by having students stay six feet apart, remain with the same teacher throughout the school day, and learn in smaller class sizes. However, without limiting the number of students present each day, hallways, buses, and classrooms are not conducive to these mitigation protocols. Therefore, education experts have explored blends of online and in-person instruction and some districts have opted for them. For instance, Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia has announced that families will have two schooling options, either full-time online instruction or two days of in-person instruction per week. This debate has also seen a push to prioritize in-person instruction as some health experts argue that schools need to seriously consider the negative consequences of online learning. Guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics argues that “all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.” The AAP suggests that online instruction makes it difficult for teachers to identify and address learning deficits and child abuse, leads to child food insecurity and&hellip;",

    "content": "After a decrease in southwest border apprehensions between July 2019 and April 2020, Customs and Border Protection data shows a rebound in single adult apprehensions in June 2020. Single adult Mexican nationals once again form a majority of apprehensions and Title 42 expulsions in fiscal year 2020 to date. This data shows migration to the U.S.-Mexico border is reverting to patterns seen between the 1970s and mid-2010s when single adult Mexican males were the overwhelming majority of arrivals, and completely reverses recent trends of majorities of Central American families traveling to the United States. June’s data shows that single adults were the bulk of southwest border encounters1, which include apprehensions and expulsions, that month. As Figure 1 shows, encounters increased from 16,405 in April 2020 to 30,300 in June, bucking the declining trend that began in July 2019. Although encounters increased for family units, unaccompanied children, and single adults, single adults generated most of overall increase, forming 89.6% of encounters in June. This development reverses recent patterns of migration to the U.S.-Mexico border in which families from Central America seeking asylum in the United States were the largest group of apprehensions. After the Trump administration deterred this group though policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols single adults reemerged as the largest group in September 2019, echoing the patterns of migration to the border seen before mid-2018. Source: DHS (1)(2) Single adult Mexican nationals form a majority of apprehensions and Title 42 expulsions to date in fiscal year 2020. As Figure 2 shows, CBP has apprehended or expelled 149,967 Mexican single adults in FY2020, accounting for 69% of all expulsions and apprehensions of single adults and 57% of all expulsions and apprehensions. Although Mexican nationals exceeded other nationalities in the single adult category in recent years, they were a smaller percentage of overall apprehensions. For instance, single adult Mexican nationals were only 17.6% of all FY2019 apprehensions but were half of single adult apprehensions. This data suggests current patterns of migration are beginning to resemble the period before FY2018 when single adult Mexicans were the primary source of migration to the border. Source: DHS  This covers the period between October 2019 and June 2020. Finally, data on the Trump administration’s border enforcement policies suggests that measures like the Title 42 order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may replicate past government practices at the U.S.-Mexico border. As Figure 3 shows, Title 42 expulsions under the mid-March CDC order have grown since its inception, increasing from 6,927 in March to 27,504 in June 2020. The growth of these expulsions kept pace with the increase in single adult apprehensions, suggesting that CBP is primarily using the Title 42 authorities to process single adult Mexicans. Reporters have noted that Title 42 expulsions can occur within 96 minutes of encounter. This process may inadvertently mark the return of so-called “catch and release” policies common from the 1970s through the 1990s, in which immigration authorities would apprehend Mexican migrants and release them into Mexico&hellip;",

    "content": "American employers face a great deal of uncertainty as they seek to find some semblance of “new normal” or “near normal” in their operations. The recent spike in positive COVID-19 cases has only added to the difficulties. Congress can help reduce the burden of uncertainty by providing clarity on the question of liability. The Bipartisan Policy Center has submitted a letter to Congress on this issue. A version of that letter appears below. Over the last three months, BPC has hosted a series of events looking at the difficult issues facing organizations of all types as they figure out a way forward. Out of these discussions, several themes emerged. One of those was the importance of offering some protection from liability, provided that organizations operate in good faith and follow public guidelines in protecting customers, employees, and vendors. Based on these discussions, it is our sense that a bipartisan bill such as the Get America Back to Work Act (H.R. 7528), sponsored by Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) and Garret Graves (R-LA), strikes the right balance between liability protection and ensuring customer and employee safety. The bill limits liability for those employers “acting in good faith” to comply with guidelines from public health authorities. No such protection is offered to those employers who may act with “gross negligence” or engage in “reckless misconduct” with “flagrant indifference” to safety. Importantly, the act is retroactive to January 1, 2020. This recognizes the constantly changing landscape of information in which employers must operate. Early on in the pandemic, face masks were held to be of small help in stopping the virus’ spread while it was thought to linger on surfaces for considerable periods of time. Today, masks are mandatory in many places and we have learned that surfaces may not spread COVID-19. As new knowledge is gained, guidelines change. It is critical not to hold employers’ past actions to a present-day standard informed by new findings. This is a vitally important issue for American employers and workers across all sectors of the economy. It deserves bipartisan support. We urge congressional leaders to consider inclusion of H.R. 7528 in the next COVID-19 relief package. There has, in fact, been bipartisan agreement on limiting liability in the past. The CARES Act included Good Samaritan language providing protection for volunteer health care professionals during the COVID-19 emergency response. That protection, like the Cuellar-Graves bill, preempted inconsistent state and local laws—but not state laws providing greater protections. The CARES Act also extended to manufacturers of personal protective equipment the liability protections of the PREP Act, which also enjoyed bipartisan support in 2005. The federal response to prior crises, including the September 11 attacks, also included bipartisan support for liability protection. In preparation for the feared Y2K computer breakdowns in 1999, then-President Bill Clinton signed two bipartisan bills to protect companies from losses and damages. Bipartisan agreement has also been reached at the state level in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Governors in New York and Illinois signed liability&hellip;",

    "content": "Direct payment bonds have a successful history of encouraging infrastructure investment during times of economic uncertainty. Unlike traditional municipal bonds, the interest earned on direct payment bonds is taxable, which makes them attractive to investors without tax liabilities, such as pension funds. Instead of allowing investors to deduct bond interest from their taxes, the federal government subsidizes the state or local issuer with a “direct payment” equal to a certain percentage of the interest rate. This model offers a more attractive interest return for bondholders while simultaneously lowering the borrowing costs for local issuers. Build America Bonds were a type of direct payment bond issued during the Great Recession as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. They were created in response to municipal bond market disruptions—a nearly 70% decline in new municipal bond issuances and 100% increase in borrowing costs at the end of 2008—and intended to help state and local governments that were struggling to finance needed projects. From April 2009 to December 2010, the federal government could provide a subsidy, equivalent to 35% of the interest rate, directly to local issuers or as a tax credit to investors. Over the course of the program, $182 billion in Build America Bonds were issued by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories. According to a Treasury Department report, the program effectively revived bond issuances and supported various infrastructure projects, including smaller developments such as schools and community centers. Most notably, issuers were found to save an average of 84 basis points on interest costs for 30-year bonds, amounting to an estimated savings of $20 billion in borrowing costs over the course of the program. The taxable nature of these bonds allowed state and local governments to accumulate net savings over the cost of the federal subsidy. In other words, the federal investment paid off. A direct payment bond program may allow state and local governments to finance critical infrastructure projects at a lower cost compared to traditional municipal bonds. While the current state of the municipal bond market is not as dire as it was during the Great Recession, state and local governments face a challenging budget and economic outlook. With the volatility in the municipal bond market at the outset of the pandemic and the continued risk of COVID-19-related financial hardships and economic disruptions, a new direct payment bond could help restore investor confidence while giving governments a tested financial tool to help them meet their infrastructure investment needs. The original Build America Bonds program was not renewed due to partisan disagreements, particularly over the appropriate level of subsidy, but the model of a subsidized, taxable bond could serve a critical long-term role in infrastructure financing. Moreover, several legislation proposals are being actively considered in Congress. Section 90101 of H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, which passed the House in July 2020, proposes a new direct payment bond program, initially with a 42% interest rate subsidy that decreases to 30% by 2027.&hellip;",

    "content": "The United States leads the world in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with the pandemic disproportionately impacting low-income people and communities of color as well as the providers that serve them. At a recent BPC event, family physician Dr. Kelly Thibert, representing the American Academy of Family Physicians noted that many of her patients are essential workers who have Medicaid coverage. As essential workers, they are unable to social distance and risk exposure to coronavirus every day. Some essential workers are uninsured because they earn too much in states that have not expanded Medicaid or are eligible but have not enrolled. COVID-19 has highlighted the need for a comprehensive primary care system in Medicaid, the nation’s safety net. Medicaid is a vital source of coverage for many vulnerable communities. Medicaid providers, especially primary care providers, have faced serious financial challenges given decreased utilization in elective care. They are also seeing increased costs from COVID-related procedures, combined with traditionally low Medicaid payment rates, and will face greater demand from an increase in Medicaid eligibility as additional individuals qualify for the program. A survey of primary care providers generally found that over a third of those responding indicated that they were not ready to deal with the surge of COVID-19 cases. Forty percent were not ready for a second wave in the fall and forty percent also said they were uncertain they would still be open in four weeks. Looking beyond the crisis, high-need patients with complex medical needs, who either chose to or were asked to forego treatment during the pandemic will have significant unmet needs. Additionally, many primary care practices, especially those serving Medicaid beneficiaries, may face closure or acquisition by larger health systems. Both factors could simultaneously lead to an increased need for high-quality, comprehensive primary care, and reduced access and appointment availability. States have indicated that they will be forced to find ways to reduce spending on Medicaid and other programs due to budget shortfalls resulting from the pandemic’s negative economic impacts on states. One way states have reduced Medicaid spending in previous economic downturns has been through reductions to provider rates, which are already low and a barrier to primary care access. In response, states and providers have asked the federal government to step in. Following passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken action to help Medicaid providers by announcing that $175 billion be appropriated through two pieces of legislation &#8212; $15 billion would go to Medicaid and CHIP providers and $12.8 billion would go to safety net hospitals. To increase access to services, Congress should increase federal match rates in Medicaid to 100% for states that increase Medicaid primary care services to Medicare rates. This should include telehealth services. As Ben Schaffer, Rhode Island’s Medicaid Director, noted at the July 7th event, such a policy would have a “tremendous impact and tremendous return on investment.”&hellip;",

    "content": "Parents living in rural communities have long struggled to access affordable, quality child care near their homes, and the current pandemic only exacerbates barriers in the rural child care system. The sheer size of rural areas often makes it difficult for families to access child care within their own communities. As a result, it is not uncommon for some parents to drive upwards of 40 miles round trip daily, for example from home to a child care provider outside of their community and then to another town for work. It is also not unusual for children from the same family to use multiple child care providers due to the lack of available slots. Even if families in rural communities find a suitable child care option, the decision to place their children in outside care is a difficult one. Rural populations are especially vulnerable to the health risks of COVID-19 due to older age, greater health challenges, and limited access to health care services. Additionally, since rural populations often live in multi-generational homes, the pandemic places rural families at higher risk of viral transmission between younger and older members. A crucial solution to these child care challenges is family child care, which provides a safe, recognizable place for children to be taken care of in a small group setting that meets the current health and safety guidelines during this pandemic. Family child care is often located in a residential home and is provided by a relative or qualified non-relative provider who works closely with each family they serve. Long before the pandemic, family child care has been an essential part of the rural child care supply. Such home-based providers make up one-fifth of licensed child care slots in rural America, which is disproportionately large compared to the only 9% and 14% of family care providers in suburban and urban regions. Particularly, family child care is well-suited to the realities of rural settings because small group sizes accommodate to local need. Large child care centers, in contrast, do not suit the dispersed demand of rural communities and can find it difficult to scale up. During the Bipartisan Policy Center’s May 2020 virtual forum, state child care administrators observed that more families are turning to family child care amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including in rural states. Family child care offers characteristics parents can trust during the public health emergency, such as small group sizes, mixed-age care, reliable providers, and neighborhood locations close to where parents live. Rural communities desperately need more child care supply in general, as well as family child care specifically, in order to sustain their local economies. The nationwide decline in home-based child care options over the recent decade suggests that rural communities are impacted the most, with fewer licensed child care options close to their home or work. The loss of child care options can be seen in specific states with significant rural populations. In Vermont, one of the most rural states, a report conducted by the Vermont Legislative&hellip;",

    "content": "America’s colleges and universities continue to grapple with the economic fallout from COVID-19. Many schools have already commenced hiring freezes, layoffs, and furloughs as they face the prolonged threat of diminishing revenues and state budget cuts. The result could likely be compromised quality and a painful surge of college closures, which is why Congress must act swiftly to protect students, faculty, and staff to stabilize higher education budgets. Surveys suggest that nearly 1 in 5 high school seniors are unlikely to attend college in the fall due to COVID-19. Not only will enrollment declines lead to an estimated $23 billion shortfall, but higher education institutions can also expect a 25% decline from auxiliary revenues, which include fees from athletic events, residence halls, conferences, and summer camps. An erosion of state support will put further pressure on public colleges and universities, as states grapple with skyrocketing unemployment claims, declining tax revenues, and ballooning public health expenditures. Together, these declines will prevent many higher education institutions from the ability to operate and perform key functions, undermining quality and increasing the risk of closure. Although our nation’s governors have asked for additional increased federal support, this faces some opposition in Congress, a situation that brings to mind lessons learned from the Great Recession over a decade ago. At the time, there was initial hesitation among lawmakers to include state K-12 and higher education support in the stimulus package, but lawmakers did eventually provide over $100 billion in educational support. However, this sum was insufficient at preventing a 24% cut in per-student funding for higher education, from which many states still haven’t recovered. COVID-19 has already proven more painful than the Great Recession, meaning that K-12 schools, colleges, and universities should brace themselves for increasingly dire cuts unless the federal government takes further action as it did in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, 2010, and 2011. In a worst-case scenario, massive declines in revenue and state support will overwhelm institutions and lead to a wave of college closures, throwing students’ futures into disarray and leading to more job losses among teachers, faculty, and staff. This would have devastating consequences for the entire U.S. public education system, with college becoming even less affordable and accessible for students, while simultaneously hampering academic quality. The American higher education system has long been considered the best in the world, but its continued prominence is not a foregone conclusion. Lawmakers must take action to support K-12 students and colleges and universities as they navigate the greatest crisis of our lifetime. Only then will educational institutions be able to continue fulfilling their vital mission as engines of social and economic mobility. F. King Alexander is the president of Oregon State University and was previously president of Louisiana State University.

However, the United States immigration system is designed around sending students back to their foreign residences at the end of their academic experience. Even though the majority of international students do return to their home countries or migrate elsewhere at the conclusion of their program, some decide to continue their residency in the United States, joining our labor force and transitioning to a different temporary visa. Foreign students who find employment opportunities in the United States and want to contribute their talents to the U.S. labor market follow a difficult road from student visa to an employment visa. The process is often complicated, lengthy, and hard to navigate. Many foreign students who engage in the U.S. labor market are filling key job shortages that benefit our economy. By making it difficult for talented international students to enter the labor force, our immigration system discourages qualified individuals, educated and trained in the United States, from contributing to the country permanently. Foreign students must utilize F, M, and J visas, which are part of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, to pursue academic enrichment in the United States. The most common of these is the F-1 student visa, which was introduced in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. According to the INA, any bona fide student can seek to enter the United States temporarily on an F-1 visa to pursue a course of study at an accredited university or college. The M-1 visa permits students to enroll in vocational training or other nonacademic programs. The J-1 visa is the second-largest category of student visas, which was introduced under the Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961 to encourage educational and cultural exchange between participants and the people of the United States. To qualify for an F or M visa, international students must meet certain eligibility criteria. Foreign students need to be enrolled in either a university program, a language training program, or a vocational institution in the United States. Student visas are only granted to those who are enrolled as full-time students at a higher educational institution, are proficient in English or are enrolled in English language classes, have sufficient funds to support themselves during their course of study, and have a permanent residency in their home countries, which they have no intention of giving up. An F-1 student’s full course of study may include only one online or distance learning class per term or semester. Students on M-1 visa are not allowed to enroll in any online classes. Students applying for a J-1 visa are selected based on their program eligibility criteria and must possess sufficient English language proficiency to participate in their desired programs. International students seeking F and M visas are required to present an I-20 form during the visa process that outlines that they are legally enrolled in a program in the United States.

    "content": "About 90% of state and local capital infrastructure spending is financed with debt, such as municipal bonds. Long-term debt enables governments to spread out the large, upfront costs of major infrastructure investments. The $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal bond market that provides this financing is well known for its relative safety and stability. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, however, that historic sense of safety was not enough to dissuade investors from selling off their holdings. Source: S&amp;P Global Starting on March 10, the S&amp;P Municipal Bond Index, which measures the fixed-rate, tax-free municipal bond market, experienced a dramatic dip of about 11% over the course of just two weeks, erasing nearly 15 months of growth. This volatility, caused by rising risks and uncertainty, has since stabilized, signaling a return in bond demand. Quick action by policymakers to provide states, local governments, territories, tribes, and the District of Columbia with fiscal relief—in legislation like the $2 trillion CARES Act—no doubt helped calm some of the volatility COVID-19 caused in the municipal bond market at the outset of the pandemic. The Federal Reserve also intervened to ensure bond markets remained liquid, establishing the Municipal Liquidity Facility on April 9 and offering up to $500 billion in loans to states, cities, and counties through the purchase of short-term anticipation notes. While most state and local debt is long term, some states issue anticipation notes to manage their cash flow. While these efforts will help state and local governments cover essential services as tax dollars dry up, they may not be enough to fully fuel their recovery. States and local governments face several headwinds moving forward: Pandemic-related shutdowns have hit state and local government budgets hard—delaying income tax payments, curtailing sales tax receipts, and resulting in massive health and public safety expenses. COVID-19 remains an ongoing public health and economic threat, with new cases per day recently exceeding 50,000 and causing some communities to halt their reopening efforts. The virus remains a general market risk, may undermine the creditworthiness of government bond issuers, and could further disrupt infrastructure projects. A handful of states, local governments, and other infrastructure bond issuers (such as transit authorities, airports, and water systems) have been hit by credit downgrades or negative watches from major rating agencies—potentially raising borrowing costs just as they grapple with budget shortfalls. (See a summary of recent ratings activity in the table below.) Rural, tribal, and other disadvantaged communities, which already faced challenges taking out debt and financing infrastructure improvements, may find it particularly challenging to service existing debt obligations and finance new projects. 185 Many infrastructure projects have stalled as a result of coronavirus prevention measures. In fact, the National League of Cities found in a survey that 65% of cities have had to delay or cancel capital expenditures and infrastructure projects since the coronavirus pandemic broke out. While some communities—from Los Angeles to Westchester, NY—have found a way to accelerate projects to take advantage of infrastructure idled by stay-at-home orders, others have been unable to&hellip;",

    "content": "Primary care has been widely accepted as a means to improve health outcomes and prevent or mitigate chronic conditions that may require more costly medical care if left untreated. Many primary care models, such as patient-centered medical homes and Medicaid health homes, use comprehensive primary care to provide patients with high quality, coordinated, patient-centered care. Comprehensive primary care often utilizes multidisciplinary teams of providers, allows more opportunities for patient engagement, and offers better coordination of clinical, behavioral, and social services when compared to traditional primary care. Providing care that has these attributes has been linked to improved health outcomes, increased savings across the health care system, and reduced health disparities. Despite these promising outcomes, many of the 70,000,000 low-income Americans who are enrolled in Medicaid lack access to primary care services, much less comprehensive primary care. Various federal barriers stand in the way of achieving comprehensive primary care within the Medicaid program. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these barriers, as stay-at- home orders have caused many individuals to delay or cancel their primary care visits, which may negatively impact their health. Additionally, as unemployment rates continue to rise due to the pandemic, enrollment in Medicaid is projected to increase, further straining the primary care providers who treat Medicaid beneficiaries, making it more difficult to achieve comprehensive primary care. Working with The Commonwealth Fund, the Bipartisan Policy Center has identified the following federal barriers to achieving comprehensive primary care in Medicaid: Insufficient resources for primary care innovation; Lack of affordable insurance coverage; Primary care workforce shortages; and, Ongoing racial, ethnic, and economic disparities in care. Last week BPC released a new report, Advancing Comprehensive Primary Care in Medicaid, which contains policy recommendations to remove or mitigate these barriers. Many primary care practices may not have the resources necessary to transform their practices to provide comprehensive primary care. To promote innovation within existing practices, BPC recommends Congress appropriate funding for the Primary Care Extension Program. The program would provide both funding and technical assistance to practices that wish to transform into comprehensive care models, such as Medicaid health homes. Funding from this program can also be used to address social determinants of health within their communities. Because health insurance coverage is a foundation of access to primary care, BPC recommends Congress level the playing field for states that have not expanded Medicaid, which was first authorized by the Affordable Care Act. Re-opening this option will allow the 13 states that did not participate in the original expansion to receive increased federal funding to help support the newly eligible population if they choose to participate. To strengthen the primary care workforce, BPC recommends increasing reimbursement rates for primary care services and providers and increasing federal funding for safety-net programs to ensure Medicaid beneficiaries have access to primary care services. The report also recommends increasing the number of J-1 visas for foreign doctors, who are more likely to go into primary care and serve Medicaid beneficiaries than US-trained doctors.

Not only will the policy present significant hardships to the foreign students, for example as a result of travel restrictions that may prevent them from returning to their home countries, but it is likely to have an adverse impact on the economy at a time when higher education finances have already been thrown into disarray. Based on BPC estimates, international graduate and undergraduate students pay roughly $20 billion per year in tuition and fees, providing a crucial source of revenue for many institutions. International students are more likely to pay the full published price for tuition and fees, giving colleges the flexibility to reduce these prices for domestic students. International graduate and undergraduate students contribute an estimated 14% of total tuition revenues at four-year institutions annually, despite comprising just around 6% of total enrollment. These revenues are especially important in the context of COVID-19, as enrollment is already projected to decrease by 15% percent this year, leading to an estimated $23 billion decline in revenues, as more students defer enrollment or choose to attend less-expensive institutions closer to home. Source: BPC Calculations from the International Institute of Education and The National Center for Education Statistics, US Department of Education Additionally, international students contribute considerably to overall economic growth. Based on estimates from NAFSA: Association of International Educators, international students spurred $41 billion in economic activity in 2018, supporting close to a half a million jobs. These economic benefits extend beyond the higher education sector and bolster a range of industries, including retail, food services, and housing. Additionally, international education was the fifth largest export in 2018, according to the Department of Commerce, valued at around $45 billion. International scholars are also disproportionately likely to specialize in STEM fields, providing valuable research and development that helps to power the economy. Requiring international students to leave the country would only further hamstring economic growth during the worst downturn in a generation, especially for cities and communities in which educational institutions are a main source of economic activity. Ultimately, policymakers would be wise to consider the many economic benefits provided by international students, and take action to ensure that these individuals can continue their studies in the United States regardless of whether their schools move online this fall.",

    "content": "At the end of July, the additional $600 in weekly unemployment benefits enacted by the CARES Act is set to expire. With roughly 31.5 million people currently collecting those benefits, the approaching deadline is forcing lawmakers to decide how unemployment insurance should continue to provide financial relief and support economic recovery. The $600 in supplemental weekly benefits has clearly provided crucial financial relief during this severe economic downturn. As local officials begin to relax stay-at-home orders, however, evidence is increasing that the additional $600 in weekly benefits serves as a disincentive for some people to return to work and inhibits an economic rebound as business activity picks back up. Going forward, lawmakers should begin to gradually phase down this supplemental weekly benefit so UI continues to provide immediate financial relief in the near term, while also encouraging work and supporting economic recovery. To ensure that such a phasedown does not cause undue hardship, particularly as the virus surges again in some parts of the country, the government should also distribute a second round of Economic Impact Payments (sometimes referred to as “recovery rebates”). The COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders implemented to contain it have resulted in unprecedented workforce disruption and tens of millions of layoffs, many of which will be permanent. To financially stabilize dislocated workers, lawmakers enacted an across-the-board increase of $600 in weekly unemployment benefits, which previously only replaced somewhere between one-third and half of prior earnings. Because all weekly unemployment benefits increased by $600, regardless of previous earnings, two-thirds of eligible unemployed workers can now collect more on UI than from their prior salary, and 20% can collect twice as much. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that should the $600 weekly benefit supplement be extended until January 2021—as proposed in the House-passed HEROES Act—five out of every six recipients would receive more in unemployment benefits than from returning to work. While many people will not yet have the option of going back to work this summer or may be discouraged from doing so for health and other reasons, some will confront the decision and may be disincentivized from returning if the additional $600 in weekly benefits remains in place as an alternative. CBO anticipates that extending the supplemental benefit through January 2021 would result in lower employment over the next two years. CBO also estimates that despite a bump in short-term economic output by raising consumption among dislocated workers, keeping the full $600 supplement in place would ultimately lower economic output in 2021 by discouraging recipients to return to work. Reduce the Supplemental Weekly Benefit to $400 and Revisit in September Rather than allowing the additional $600 to expire in full at the end of July or extending the same supplemental benefit through the end of the year or beyond, lawmakers should reduce the additional weekly benefit to $400 for August and September. Dislocated workers clearly need to continue to receive additional financial relief during those months, but the number of recipients for whom UI benefits&hellip;",

    "content": "In June 2020, the Trump administration extended an executive order issued in April that suspended the processing of green cards overseas with the stated aim of protecting American workers from foreign competition during the COVID-19 recession. Although the order exempted certain categories of employment-based immigrants such as healthcare workers, it banned the entry of nearly all categories of employment-based green cards. Our analysis of data from the Department of Labor suggests1 that the administration’s policy falls short of meeting its stated objectives. We found that the industry supersectors with the greatest employment losses during the current recession do not align with the industry subsectors that have applied for the most employment-based green cards. Furthermore, the employment losses in the largest subsectors exceeded the number of certified applications they received between 2006 and 2019. Sources: BLS (1),(2), OFLC &nbsp; &nbsp; Although all industries have suffered employment losses during the recession, our analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that service supersectors such as Leisure and Hospitality and heavy industries such as mining suffered the greatest percentage losses compared to their mid-to-high skilled counterparts between February and June 2020 (Figure 1). Other studies examining these trends support our findings. After a March 2020 Brookings study identified the leisure and hospitality supersector as the one most vulnerable to employment losses in a COVID-driven downturn, subsequent studies from other organizations found that this supersector and other service-oriented sectors had the highest employment losses since the recession’s onset in February. Studies also revealed that the employment losses gradually spread from low-skilled to high-skilled sectors during the recession, with the leisure and hospitality supersector hit first and higher-skilled sectors such as finance and insurance impacted last. Studies on the disparities in job losses across U.S. industries discovered that jobs in service sectors suffered large losses because their positions require face-to-face interactions, leading employers to lay off their workers as states’ stay-at-home orders shuttered these businesses. In contrast, high- and mid-skilled industries had fewer losses because more employees could work remotely during these shutdowns.2 While analyses of employment levels in June 2020 noted service sectors had modest employment increases because more employees could return to work after states lifted restrictions (reflected in Figure 1), the decisions of some state governments to pause or rollback reopening plans after June’s surge of COVID-19 cases may limit this recovery since these measures severely impact service sector businesses like bars. Source: DOL  A review of the five NAICS subsectors with the most annual certified labor applications for employment-based green cards suggests that most of these beneficiaries have worked in high-to-mid-skilled industries since 2006. As Figure 2 shows, the top five NAICS subsectors account between 67.4% to 83.4% of the NAICS subsectors that receive certifications. The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services subsector, which has sponsored many employees to work industries such as engineering and other STEM fields, received 31.7% to 47.7% of these certifications.

    "content": "Since its inception in 1990, the H-1B visa has provided a route to permanent residency for thousands of nonimmigrants living and working in the United States. For many, this pathway of acquiring a green card includes years of hurdles, bureaucratic mazes, and financial expenses. The process is fraught with confusing procedural government inflexibility, “black boxes” of no information, and long backlogs. The unpredictability of the pathway from H-1B to green card creates significant obstacles for nonimmigrants looking to use this path to gain long term residency in the United States. The origin of the H-1B visa can be traced back to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Before the INA, the 1885 Foran Act, also called the Alien Contract Labor Law, made it unlawful for anyone to bring unskilled foreign workers into the United States to work under contract. This law effectively prevented employers from bringing migrants to the United States with a promise of a job. The INA, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, established the H-1 program for foreign workers “of distinguished merit and ability” who are performing “temporary services of an exceptional nature.” Historically the H-1 visa has been used by individuals in a variety of professional fields, including health, academia, and entertainment to enter and live in the United States. Over the subsequent decades, various regulations and administrative decisions evolved which effectively equated “distinguished merit and ability” with professional occupations requiring a bachelor’s degree. The criteria for artists and entertainers to show “distinguished merit” was determined by different criteria, that required “prominence” in their field. The Immigration Act of 1990 separated out most artists and entertainers into the new O and P nonimmigrant categories and amended the H1 visa into H-1A for nurses (later repealed in 1999) and H-1B for foreign workers in “specialty occupations.” The law further codified that “specialty occupations” meant occupations requiring a bachelor’s or higher degree of attainment in a “body of highly specialized knowledge.&#8221; 1 The original cap on the H-1B visa was set to 65,000 visas per year. In 1998, the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act raised the H-1B visa cap to 115,000 per year because of the high demand for H-1B workers, especially in the IT industry. The cap was further increased to 195,000 for 2001, 2002, and 2003 under the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act. Signed by President George W. Bush, the act exempted non-profits, research organizations, and academic institutions of higher education from the cap. Presently, the annual H-1B visa cap has reverted back to 65,000 under the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004, with an additional 20,000 H-1B visas available each year for those with advanced degrees from U.S. academic institutions, such as a master’s or doctorate, while retaining the exemptions from AC21. An employer who wants to hire a foreign worker in the H-1B category must petition for the qualified candidate to enter the United States with an H-1B visa or to change their status from a different nonimmigrant visa category&hellip;",

Its history, commercial power, and significance as an essential water transportation corridor is felt throughout this region. The largest city in the mainly rural area is Paducah with only about 25,000 residents. Although the district is in the bottom 10% of median household income compared to other congressional districts, it is filled with a proud people determined to overcome their relative isolation and build a self-sustaining culture and economy. Both Comer, a second-term congressman, and Rep. Joe Cunningham, a freshman representing South Carolina’s 1st district, are among the newest faces in Congress. They knew each other casually but had never spent any serious time together. When Cunningham visited Comer in June with BPC’s ACE program, the members found common ground on issues that touch some of the committees they serve on. Cunningham, a former ocean engineer, serves on the House Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Natural Resources Subcommittee, which oversees the implementation of laws managing domestic fisheries and other marine resources. Comer, a former Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner, is the ranking member of the full House Oversight and Reform Committee, including the Subcommittee on Environment, which has jurisdiction over public lands, endangered species, air and water quality, oceans, and conservation. The trip also featured a unique personal connection because Cunningham grew up in Comer’s district, in Kuttawa, on the shores of Lake Barkley. His father, Bill Cunningham, is a noted legal scholar who recently retired as a Kentucky state Supreme Court Justice. Lake Barkley is formed from a dam that impounds the Cumberland River about 38 miles upstream from where the Cumberland empties into the Ohio River. It was there that the congressmen began their visit with a boat tour guided by fishermen fighting the invasive Asian Carp. First introduced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1963 as a way to control aquatic weeds and phytoplankton, the carp, with no natural predators, have reproduced exponentially, feeding on the bottom of the food chain. Today, the Asian Carp are a threat to native fish and the natural ecosystems. The next morning brought the members to the Kentucky Dam, built and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). This powerful hydroelectric dam on the Tennessee River opened in 1944 and took six years to build. It is the longest dam in the TVA system and created the largest reservoir in the eastern U.S. The five generators are original to the site and the technology installed then is still considered “state-of-the-art”. Both South Carolina and Kentucky are served by the same electric grid in the SERC region of the Eastern Connection. TVA feeds electricity to this grid. In contrast to the speed of the TVA project in the 1930s and 1940s, the new larger lock being built adjacent to the dam will take 29 years to be finished (1996-2025)! The current lock, because of its small size, can cause delays of up to twelve hours&hellip;",

The lessons we have learned about how to make the voting process safe and accessible must guide plans for November. Keeping elections safe and healthy won’t be easy. As businesses and public entities are reopening their doors and Americans begin to venture out of their homes in greater numbers, COVID-19 cases are spiking in some states, which doesn’t bode well for a potential second wave in the fall. Election administrators should reflect on what has worked so far for voting during the age of coronavirus and where policy change can improve the safety of the voting experience by forming true partnerships with state and local public health entities. Election administrators have formed partnerships to facilitate voting access with different sectors in the past, including with the U.S. Postal Service on absentee ballots, the Department of Defense for military and overseas citizen voting, design experts to make ballots and other election materials more accessible, and more. Before this year, though, there was little obvious need for election administrators to partner with public health entities except for things like disaster contingency plans for safe voting in the event of floods or hurricanes. The pandemic changed all that. Looking at recent elections, Wisconsin attempted to navigate through the first wave of the pandemic, and because of close work with state and local public health departments, cases for COVID-19 did not surge to numbers expected in most of the state. Wisconsin was able to demonstrate that effective coordination with public health officials and expansion of by-mail voting options can better facilitate voting during a global public health crisis. Georgia had issues with a lack of preparedness for pandemic voting, which resulted in long lines and problems with voting machines. With lessons learned post-primary for Georgia, they can better prepare for a general election come November. After an unprecedented primary season, we have learned a great deal more about administering elections during a crisis. Many states had to change their elections process entirely to improve safety for poll workers and voters alike. The CARES Act allocated $400 million to the states to cope with changes in elections during the pandemic. This funding is flexible and can be allocated to expand by-mail voting options and procure PPE and cleaning supplies for poll workers. While many scientific questions around the virus remain, it has been proven that COVID-19 is primarily spread through the respiratory route from person to person. Evidence has driven prevention efforts thus far and should continue driving decisions to create safe voting environments, which include mandated public use of masks. In fact, research shows that the transmission rates are lowered significantly if everyone wears a mask. These are the evidence-based approaches that should be implemented for the general elections. If contingency plans are not based on good public health research, it could result in surges of coronavirus cases or debilitatingly long lines outside of in-person&hellip;",

    "content": "The already-shaky financial picture for many American households has been further threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. In particular, a lack of emergency savings was a serious problem long before this crisis, and many households are now draining what little they had. Liquid savings, of course, is only one piece of the financial security puzzle, and it should be addressed in tandem with retirement savings, student loan and personal debt, housing, and jobs, which are all intrinsically linked. But when a household is living essentially paycheck to paycheck, without any cash on hand to cover unforeseen expenses, bigger-picture planning is nearly impossible. Financial resiliency must be the starting point. For the average American, liquid savings are what can prevent urgent financial needs from becoming a full-blown crisis. Even prior to COVID-19, most household balance sheets were in rough shape. A 2019 survey found that 65% of households lack a mere six weeks of take-home pay on hand. Another survey of likely voters, conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Center and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, found that 37% of respondents would be unable to cover more than a month of normal spending with their emergency savings. This liquid savings shortfall can have devastating consequences for long-term financial security. Specifically, it can lead workers to jeopardize their financial futures by drawing down their retirement accounts, incurring taxes and often penalties. In more dire circumstances—particularly for many low- and moderate-income families—an unexpected medical expense or broken-down car can force a household to borrow on high-interest credit cards, resort to costly payday loans, or spiral into foreclosure or eviction. Some of the consequences can be seen through underserved consumers, such as those without bank accounts and those using alternative financial services like payday loans, who collectively spent $173 billion in fees and interest payments during 2017. Penalizing those with less access to liquid savings replicates itself across other systems, which can unfortunately tether those without financial means to a cycle of debt and financial insecurity. Although households throughout the country struggle to build up a savings cushion, the challenge is most acute in communities of color. Prior to the pandemic, Prosperity Now found that 37% of U.S. households are liquid-asset poor, meaning they have insufficient savings to live for three months at the federal poverty rate, but 58% of Black and Latino households fell into that category. Much of this difference can be attributed to longstanding racial income and wealth gaps. Fast-forward to the current crisis, which has further elevated this issue of emergency savings. As families across the nation deal with financial shocks, including loss of work and reduced wages, hospital bills, and unexpected expenses, the ability to set aside additional funds has grown even more difficult. Many households are draining the limited savings they started with, which is especially true among households of color, who have been hit harder by COVID-19 and its fallout. BPC’s survey from May found that among those with emergency savings at the start of&hellip;",

    "content": "Long lines at polling places, often due to precinct consolidation and absentee ballot failures, have garnered outsize attention during the spring primary elections. But close followers of election news may have been intrigued to see media and observers refer to something called “electronic poll books,” which improve the voting experience when working well. Electronic poll books, also called e-poll books or EPBs, are a modernization of paper voter rolls that are meant to simplify and speed up the check-in process during in-person voting. Traditionally, when a voter arrives at a polling place, a poll worker checks to make sure their name is in a paper poll book that lists all the eligible voters in that precinct—which means looking through hundreds or even thousands of names listed in alphabetical order. The poll worker then makes a mark or the voter signs somewhere near their name. The paper process sometimes leads to signatures on the wrong lines, complicating checking in for voters who appear later in the day. At polling places with EPBs, poll workers use a laptop or tablet to quickly search for a voter’s name to verify that they’re eligible to vote there. So, are EPBS to blame for long lines, or do they speed up the voting process? And are they more or less secure than paper alternatives? As of last year, EPBs were being used in 41 states and the District of Columbiaf.. But this year, EPBs have been linked to problems in several states during the primaries. During a special primary election in Maryland, election officials reported serious slowdowns in EPBs that were linked via wireless network to the state’s voter database. This wireless connection was intended to allow the state to see real-time data about turnout, but it slowed down the check-in process and caused some voters to experience delays. Long lines in Los Angeles County during the March primary have also been linked to EPB malfunctions. Recently, some election cybersecurity experts have raised concerns that hackers could exploit bugs in EPBs to cause election night chaos if they’re connected to wireless networks. So why, given all these potential problems, do so many states continue to use EPBs? The simple answer is that for most, the overall usefulness outweighs the risks. EPBs can do more than just allow voters to sign in electronically. If a voter shows up at the wrong polling place, poll workers can quickly see the problem and redirect that voter to the correct site. In states that allow same-day registration, voters can also register to vote on an EPB. EPBs notify poll workers on Election Day if a voter has already cast an absentee ballot or cast an in-person ballot during the early voting period, providing a safeguard against double voting. They can also give election officials real-time updates about participation levels at different polling places. EPBs can significantly speed up the process of checking voters in, cutting down on delays in the voting process. For instance, in some jurisdictions EPBs include&hellip;",

    "content": "As the pandemic has unfolded, millions of Americans have been laid off, furloughed, or lost wages, while others have been unable to work due to personal health or family caregiving needs brought on by the disease. Under the CARES Act, passed in March, nearly all of these individuals are eligible to receive some form of unemployment insurance. The CARES Act also included an across-the-board $600 increase in weekly UI benefits through the end of July. But skyrocketing unemployment has slammed, underfunded and outdated state UI delivery systems, revealing administrative failures that slowed implementation of program expansions and have kept many individuals waiting to receive their checks. The UI system has never before experienced a wave of claims like this. Workers filed nearly 1.5 million initial claims last week—the lowest number since the start of the pandemic but still more than twice the pre-pandemic record. This figure also doesn’t include the over 728,000 initial claims submitted by those covered through Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), a program in the CARES Act which provides UI to freelancers, self-employed business owners, gig workers, and others unable to work due to health or caregiving needs resulting from the virus—all of whom are usually ineligible for standard UI. In the 14 weeks since the start of the pandemic, workers have submitted more than 43 million initial claims for standard UI (not seasonally adjusted). By comparison, fewer than 6 million initial claims were submitted over the same time period at the start of the Great Recession. The UI system is a federal-state partnership. It is financed through payroll taxes on employers by both states and the federal government, with individual states responsible for designing and administering their own programs. As such, states have faced varying challenges with processing the influx of claims from COVID-19 and implementing the benefit expansion under the CARES Act. For the most part, the state programs that administer UI have proven deficient, with the process of applying for UI at the height of the lockdowns and closures characterized by crashing websites and jammed phone lines. In an attempt to manage the influx, some states hired additional call center staff or asked workers to call or submit claims on certain days of the week based on the first letter of their last name. But these actions haven’t been enough to help state UI programs keep pace. A recent BPC survey of likely voters found that only 61% of those who applied for UI during the crisis (and were not aware of having been denied) say they have received their benefits, and 30% of those who applied described the process as hard to navigate. The crux of the problem is that many state UI programs lack the technical infrastructure needed to swiftly implement new programs or process a high volume of claims. Twelve states use programs built with COBOL, a six-decade-old coding language whose programmers have largely aged out of the workforce. In Colorado, the state program was maintained by just a single programmer prior&hellip;",

    "content": "On one Wednesday in early June, the U.S. House of Representatives held four remote committee hearings covering topics from voting to emergency preparedness. For many working in the field of congressional reform, the transition to remote committee hearings was a resounding win. Not only do remote hearings help prevent the spread of COVID-19, but they show a kind of flexibility and technical-prowess that is too often missing from the halls of the Capitol. However, while we applaud committees for continuing to function in this uncertain time, we must not forget that simply streaming a hearing online does not necessarily make it accessible. Each of the four hearings that took place on June 3rd were hosted on the Cisco Webex Virtual Platform which, unlike Microsoft Teams and Google Meet, does not have built in closed-captioning capabilities. While auditory impairments are far from the only access needs Congress must consider, the lack of closed-captioning embedded into the Webex platform highlights the ongoing difficulties that the public, witnesses, staff, and congressmembers with disabilities face when attempting to engage with the legislative branch. Congress has statutory obligations to meet when it comes to accessibility, but it should go further in considering the adaptations necessary for remote proceedings that the public, members of Congress, and staff need to meaningfully participate in the legislative process. While the term ‘accessibility’ often brings to mind physical access needs like wheelchair ramps and automatic doors, the transition away from the Capitol and onto the internet brings a host of other accessibility issues to bear. In fact, Congress (and all federal agencies) are required by law to meet accessibility standards in all of their electronic communications. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 “requires Federal agencies to ensure that members of the public with disabilities have comparable access to publicly-available information.” Section 508 specifically applies to electronic information and communications technology, which would cover any public hearing or meeting that Congress holds. While Congress is not a federal agency, Sections 102 and 210 of the Congressional Accountability Act mandate that Congress comply with the federal accessibility requirements detailed in both the Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act, respectively. The Center for Talent Innovation found that only 21% of employees with disabilities disclose them to their HR department. Given the structural and cultural biases against persons with disabilities that inhibit self-reporting, Congress should not make content accessible only when notified that a staff member, witness, or congressmember has a disability. Such an approach is not only inefficient and ineffective, but it unfairly places the burden of notification on persons with disabilities. Instead, Congress should integrate accessibility into its operations from day one. Congress is already required by law to meet certain accessibility standards, but to keep content accessible as operations move online, it must make accessibility a priority from the start when considering new remote platforms. As the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services emphasizes, “It is much easier to create content that is accessible in the first&hellip;",

Considering the House and Senate have rarely moved in step this year, it seemed there was a glimmer of hope in that both chambers were advancing legislation on the same topic at the same time. However, in the case of the current police reform bills under consideration, Congress is making serious unforced errors, potentially dooming solutions to deep-rooted and long-unaddressed issues of racial inequity and injustice. Speaker Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader McConnell announced their intentions to bring police reform legislation up for a vote in their respective chambers this week. The House announced plans to consider H.R. 7120 introduced by Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA-37) by Friday, June 26th. The Senate was to consider Senator Tim Scott’s (R-SC) S. 3985 as early as June 24th. This may be a speed record for this Congress, but the rush to legislate does not allow for the kind of political dialogue the nation needs to move forward. Congress is the forum for the country to grapple with the challenges of our time. Yet, in the interest of expediency, the House and Senate have skipped crucial steps that will allow it to fully surface the diversity of experiences and frustrations in society related to policing and race. This is no way to decide who we want to be as a nation and the direction we want to move in. And it’s not the way Congress is designed to work. “Regular order,” Beltway lingo for an ideal legislative process, is so rare that it’s almost an urban legend these days. Generally, it means that, before a bill receives a final vote, it has been through committee consideration, debate, and amendments on the floor. Regular order is a way for our representatives to reason together, to identify the range of problems on a given topic and decide on solutions. Congress does little of that these days. A lack of regular order is often raised by the minority party as evidence of weakness in the majority party’s plans, but both parties are hypocritical when it comes to the issue. Rather than a partisan grenade, the Bipartisan Policy Center sees regular order as the oil that keeps the engines of our democracy moving. Committee consideration should be extensive, including background briefings and staff reports, fact-finding hearings, the seeking of administration views, a committee markup to refine the text and build broad support for a favorable report, and final report writing. Here, the Senate falls short. Senator Scott’s bill has not received a committee markup or report, which suggests that little of the preceding work was done as well. The Senate Judiciary Committee did hold a hearing on “Police Use of Force and Community Relations,” where it heard from 11 witnesses over a five-hour period, but that alone is not a sufficient foundation for national reform legislation. The House Judiciary Committee has held both a&hellip;",

    "content": "A bachelor’s degree is one of the single most effective pathways to economic mobility in America today. Yet the promise of higher education as an engine of economic opportunity belies persistent racial disparities throughout the higher education pipeline—from access and enrollment to employment and loan repayment outcomes. These opportunity and outcome gaps for Black, Indigenous, and other people of color in higher education hurt individuals, families, and communities, in addition to hampering U.S. economic growth. Here are four bipartisan improvements to federal policy that would work to address these longstanding racial inequities. The high cost of college is a critical barrier to Black, Indigenous, and other students of color, in part due to longstanding wealth and income disparities. As college prices have risen, need-based aid has not kept pace. This pattern hurts Black students in particular, who are more likely to borrow to pay for college—and more likely to take on higher levels of debt. Expanding need-based aid through the Pell Grant program would promote affordability and improve outcomes for students of color. Among Pell-eligible students, an additional $3,500 in annual grant aid is associated with up to a 5 percentage point increase in bachelor’s degree attainment. Restoring Pell Grant eligibility to incarcerated individuals is also key to increasing access for Black students, as Black incarceration rates are five times that of white incarceration rates. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, other Minority Serving Institutions including Tribal Colleges and Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and community colleges disproportionately serve students of color and are often under-resourced. HBCUs receive less federal funding per student than their non-HBCU counterparts, and while they account for only 3% of institutions participating in the federal student aid program, they award 17% of all Black bachelor’s degrees. Additionally, as Hispanic enrollment has increased nationally, schools are increasingly being designated as HSIs, but federal funding is not keeping pace. HSIs receive, on average and on a per-student basis, 69 cents for every dollar of federal funding going to other colleges and universities. As proven engines of mobility, policymakers should target additional support to MSIs to boost their capacity to serve students of color. These funds should be given directly to institutions and used for evidence-based interventions that break down barriers and improve outcomes. As the economic fallout from COVID-19 threatens the already fragile balance sheets of postsecondary institutions across the country, a wave of college closures seems inevitable. If past is precedent, this will disproportionately harm students of color, who accounted for 57% of those impacted by shuttered schools between 2014 and 2018. When a college closes unexpectedly, students are left with few options to continue progress toward their degree. Students can elect to have their federal student loans forgiven—giving up any credits earned—or participate in a teach-out plan set forth by their closing school. Teach-out plans, however, are often hastily designed or lack funding, putting students at increased risk of not completing their degrees. The risk is even greater for Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic students, who tend to take longer&hellip;",

    "content": "Had a pandemic never happened, hospitality businesses in my hometown of Montauk, NY, would have spent recent weeks readying cadres of seasonal migrant workers to serve summer tourists. Instead, many are now worrying they won’t be able to hire enough workers at all. As the East End of Long Island slowly reopens along with the rest of New York, the town has struggled to find enough workers to meet the increasing demands of the burgeoning summer population. While COVID-19 has impacted almost every sector of the economy and led to more than 40 million jobless claims, the pandemic has wreaked the most havoc in the service, hospitality, and leisure industries. As travel across the globe came to a virtual standstill this spring, the leisure and hospitality industry faced a 39.3% unemployment rate in April 2020, compared to the industry’s 4.5% unemployment rate just a year earlier. Although states and regions in the United States are slowly opening up, this summer will look significantly different for employers in the tourism industry and will be particularly difficult for resort towns that rely on seasonal migrant workers to fill summer shortages. The challenges facing Montauk, a small village at the very tip of Long Island with a year-round local population of 3,655, encapsulate those for many places all over the nation as summer kicks into full gear. Like many resort destinations with a small local resident population, Montauk depends heavily on seasonal migrant labor to support the number of vacationing tourists in the summer months. In the United States, 20% of workerss in the tourism industry are foreign-born. Since most of the roles in the industry are low-paid, low-status, and seasonal, it is often difficult to fill vacant roles with local, native-born Americans. Seasonal migrant workers including farmworkers, landscapers, hotel staff, resort workers, and cashiers and baggers at the local grocery store, play a crucial role in supporting the economy in its busiest months. Without them, Montauk would not be able to keep pace with the influx of tourists over the summer. The COVID-19 pandemic escalated Montauk’s need for seasonal workers earlier in the season. In mid-March, when the virus was at its peak in New York, the East End community saw a significant influx of residents from New York City seeking refuge from the outbreak. The local rental market boomed, and as a result, Montauk and the neighboring communities were hit with peak season-level crowds, even though the local businesses had only enough resources and workers to service the local, winter-level population. As the spring turned to early summer and COVID-19 case counts in New York declined, additional visitors have traveled out east, even as hotels and other businesses continue to struggle to hire enough employees to meet the demand. For example, as more people began to ready their homes for summer, landscapers were in high demand in April and May, but landscaping businesses struggled to fulfill orders because they didn’t have enough seasonal H-2B workers available. In addition, at the start&hellip;",

    "content": "As the United States continues to experience historic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, recommendations for federal policymakers have been proposed by many organizations to support the recovery and rebuilding of the U.S. economy. Congress has an opportunity to advance investments that will have near and long-term benefits, particularly in the areas of infrastructure and energy technology. The Bipartisan Policy Center has identified several specific recommendations that are uniquely positioned to help Americans through the current crisis while also rebuilding our nation’s traditional strengths in innovation and technology leadership. One of these proposals is to provide direct cash payments to clean energy developers in lieu of tax credits. Investment and production tax credits have historically been successful in supporting clean energy projects. However, in the context of a larger economic slowdown, tax equity markets tend to shrink and capture a higher proportion of the available credit value as a transaction cost. Implementing direct pay could help address these issues. A direct pay tax policy as an alternative to tax credits could result in more jobs, greater economic activity, and more new projects than would otherwise be the case. On June 5, BPC hosted a webinar briefing examining direct pay—what it is, and how it can help the clean energy industry. Industry and policy experts joined the conversation to show support for direct pay and discuss this alternative incentive structure. Hunter Johnston, a partner at Steptoe and Johnston, provided an introduction to the concept of direct pay and a brief legislative history. Direct pay is a tax policy that allows energy property tax credit holders to receive a direct cash payment from the U.S. Treasury, instead of resorting to the tax equity market. Johnston pointed to evidence that direct pay’s ability to avoid the tax equity market is beneficial to the energy sector because it allows more inclusive and efficient distribution of incentives for novel energy projects. Johnston explained that according to a Congressional Research Service report on tax incentives, allowing taxpayers to treat tax credits as an overpayment of taxes makes direct pay a more efficient incentive. The more margin that is extracted by tax equity, the less money is available for actual project development, but with direct pay, the pool of money for new advanced energy projects is much larger. Johnston also provided a legislative timeline of direct pay tax policies and proposals over the past decade: 2009: The Section 1603 U.S. Treasury Cash Grant Program, a precursor to modern direct pay proposals, was authorized in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The program was met with difficult politics and cumbersome logistics but is regarded as a success in terms of dollars invested and projects deployed. The 1603 program required taxpayers to file a separate application to the Treasury Department that the proposed direct pay mechanism avoids. 2010: The term “direct pay” is introduced in the House Ways and Means Committee, in the Domestic Manufacturing and Energy Jobs Act by Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI). The bill did not progress,&hellip;",

    "content": "The coronavirus pandemic has had immense impacts on the child care industry. At the height of the crisis, 60% of child care programs around the country had closed and one-third of the child care workforce had lost their job. Child care providers were pessimistic about their ability to stay in business long-term, and about half of parents were worried their child care provider would close permanently. As states begin to reopen, many child care programs are as well. But for many, making it to the point of reopening was just the first step. Staying open in the coming months will be a significant challenge for many programs that operated on slim margins before the crisis, blew through savings during the pandemic, and face ongoing loss of revenue and increased costs for the foreseeable future—most likely until there is a vaccine. States are running out of their dedicated child care funding provided in the CARES Act, which was intended to be short-term stopgap assistance for the market to weather the crisis. Child care programs are still in the thick of the crisis and in dire need of assistance, revealing that Congress may have underestimated the amount of time this emergency would last for them. The following is a summary of the challenges child care providers are facing as they struggle to reopen, how states are using the few child care dollars they have left to enable providers to reopen, and the ways state and local governments are desperately pulling from other funding streams to prop up a sector that the economy needs in order to restart. Increased Costs: Reopening and Retrofitting Facilities. For child care businesses to reopen and stay open during the remainder of this crisis, programs must take steps to reduce the risk of transmission which may require facility upgrades and modifications. These steps include creating self-contained classrooms and/or additional classroom space to accommodate social distancing and smaller group sizes, upgrading ventilation systems to improve air quality, retrofitting entryways to meet new screening protocols, enhancing hygienic features such as additional child-sized sinks and bathrooms, and other improvements to reduce the risk of exposure. These safety measures are necessary for the child care industry to rebound since 70% of child care teachers and 75% of parents feel uncomfortable returning to child care due to health and safety concerns. However, many programs around the country are having trouble paying for the supplies necessary to comply with these heightened safety standards. In an April survey, nearly two thirds of California providers reported difficulty obtaining PPE and cleaning supplies, and requested financial assistance to do so. In an April survey, 62% of South Carolina providers indicated that facilities costs like HVAC were a major financial concern, and 39% considered the costs of emergency sanitation supplies a major financial concern. Lost Revenue: Reduced Class Sizes and Ratios. Restrictions on class sizes and reduced child-to-teacher ratios to limit the amount of social interactions mean less income for programs. Most states require providers to limit care&hellip;",

    "content": "For as long as official economic data have been kept, they have shown wide and persistent disparities in the economic wellbeing of white and Black Americans. Historically, the unemployment rate for Black workers is about twice as high as that for white workers. In fact, for the significant majority of the past 50 years, the Black unemployment rate has exceeded the highest white unemployment during the depths of the Great Recession (Figure 1).1 While the employment picture for Black Americans greatly improved from 2010 to 2020—as it generally does during expansions—the economic recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically reversed the employment gains over the past decade. Black Americans also earn far less than white Americans: In 2019, the median Black American earned 69 cents in pre-tax income for every dollar earned by the median white person (including pre-tax government benefits). 2 Despite momentous changes like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the War on Poverty, this gap has only widened (Figure 2). Higher unemployment rates and lower incomes are not the only disparities. Twenty-one percent of Black Americans are food insecure, compared to 8% of whites.3 The Black poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past 50 years, but it remains roughly double the highest white poverty rate ever recorded.4 Black graduates of four-year colleges hold more student debt than any other group, and Black student borrowers are more than three times as likely as white borrowers to default within twelve years of enrollment. In short, racial economic disparities are longstanding. A recent survey from the Bipartisan Policy Center, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, shows how the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout have made these inequities even wider. At the time we are writing, the coronavirus has killed almost 120,000 Americans and caused another 19.5 million to lose their jobs. It has upended millions of lives, and Americans of all races are suffering. But the virus and its economic impact have been especially harsh for Black Americans, causing longstanding disparities to widen. The pandemic’s unequal racial toll starts with the disease itself. Because of disparities in living circumstances, work conditions, and underlying health, Black Americans are more than twice as likely to die from coronavirus as their white counterparts. Indeed, Black workers face the worst of both worlds: They are more likely than white workers to be employed in jobs deemed essential and thus exposed to infection and also more likely to work in cyclically sensitive industries that have laid off workers. As a result, the unemployment rate has risen more for Black workers than white workers (Figure 3). BPC’s survey from May provides richer details than have previously been available on the unequal damage of this recession, though it is important to note that the survey is of likely voters rather than all adults. Another source of information is the Census Household Pulse Survey, a weekly survey that the Census Bureau recently launched to measure how the pandemic is affecting&hellip;",

    "content": "The role of free expression in shaping campus life and our broader society is historically a contentious one. The last century has seen many attempts to curb the “excesses” of campus protest or force out faculty who offer controversial opinions. In the past, academic leaders have reacted to these moments by codifying their support for free expression in formal statements: for example, the 1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom from the American Association of University Professors, the 1967 Kalven Report from the University of Chicago, or the 1974 Woodward Report from Yale University. In the last half-decade, formal commitments to free expression statements have made a comeback. Scores of institutions have endorsed the Chicago Principles since 2015, when the University of Chicago adopted them in response to growing concern over speech suppression. Other schools have taken up the task of drafting their own statements to fit their unique needs and mission. We surveyed the higher education landscape for a big-picture look at the various ways schools have framed free expression to meet community expectations. As a 2019 study of five prominent universities found, the number of students who agreed that “unpopular opinions can be expressed freely on campus” differed dramatically depending on the school polled. Liberals at one school could agree with that statement by as much as 72%, while their liberals peers elsewhere might agree by as little as 29%. The same holds for self-identified conservatives, who agreed by as much as 57% and by as little as 16% depending on the campus. Beyond the attitudes of students, these institutions vary by size, denomination, governance structures, and whether they are public or private. An approach to free expression that works for a 3,000-student private liberal arts college is not likely to suit the five campuses of an 80,000-student public university. Not only do these schools promulgate their speech policies differently, but their campus cultures dictate distinct free expression norms. The following three categories of free expression statement capture the different emphases and framings schools have used to tailor free expression commitments to their unique campus body. One variety of statement rests free expression on a liberal framework, emphasizing the individual as the main ingredient in the free expression formula. Such a view is rights-focused. It holds that individuals, acting alone or in concert, have the right to voice their thoughts, so long as doing so does not create a dangerous environment or unduly tread on the rights of others. The Chicago Principles are a model statement for the individualistic approach and are representative of this statement category. The principles begin by focusing on the autonomy of individuals within a community: Because the University is committed to free and open inquiry in all matters, it guarantees all members of the University community the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. Whereas some types of free expression statements articulate community values that are part of the free expression right, an individualistic framing promotes those values as a&hellip;",

    "content": "College campuses are too often marked by “the dominance of conformity,” with few conservative or libertarian scholars and teachers. This is not due so much to overt hostility to conservatives as to methodological trends in the social sciences that have had the unintended consequence of discouraging conservatives from pursuing academic careers and research agendas, as analyzed in previous posts in this series (here, here, here, and here). The need to increase intellectual diversity on campus has become a platitude, even among many left-leaning campus leaders, but concrete ideas for doing so are few. In practice, “intellectual diversity” mostly means ideological diversity, but even if universities didn&#8217;t seem to be so allergic to consciously hiring conservative faculty (a non-starter for a number of reasons found in my previous articles), there is a supply problem: there aren’t enough conservative academics available to go around. But there are ways universities can spur a more robust exchange of viewpoints on campus. Here are five ideas universities might consider: Princeton University’s course “The Examined Life” is a model schools might imitate. The course is team-taught by Professors Robert P. George and Cornel West. George is one of the most prominent conservative academics today, and West is an equally well-known progressive who chaired the Black Studies department at Princeton. The class is a “great books”-style seminar in which George and West each choose half the reading list, and which brings to the same classroom conservative students and left-leaning students and offers a stimulating divergence of perspectives on classic texts—a genuine exercise in teaching students how to think rather than what to think. The George-West combination may not be easily replicated, and it originated serendipitously. George and West first met during an interview West conducted with George for a student journal in 2004 that spilled over into several hours of vigorous argument between the pair afterward. West and George began meeting regularly to continue their arguments, which ultimately led to the idea of teaching a seminar together. Such a collaboration will not likely work simply by finding a left-leaning and right-leaning faculty member and pushing them together in a classroom. One key lesson from the George-West collaboration is that the pair share a similar philosophy of classroom teaching, and are genuinely fond of each other despite their divergent perspectives, which is not something that can be taken for granted. But if such a match can be found, a university will have a treasure on its hands. The George-West course is always heavily oversubscribed when it is offered, and students of all persuasions rave about it. It has been such a success that they visit other campuses—including American University, Auburn University, Brandeis University, and many others—for public conversations, where students find an inspiring model of respectful discourse in spite of principled disagreements. A variation in the West-George collaboration can be found at the Claremont Colleges, where left-leaning Pitzer College Professor Phil Zuckerman teamed up with right-leaning Claremont McKenna College Professor Jon Shields for a course entitled “The University&hellip;",

The discussion addressed the economic fallout from the pandemic and the shaky financial situations that many families and communities are facing across the country. We were joined by our partners at Prudential, George Washington University&#8217;s Global Finance Literacy Excellence Center, the Bipartisan Policy Center, and Edelman Financial Engines to offer guidance on personal finances and to discuss and answer viewer questions. Watch the full event here and read the highlights below: In January 2020, 27% of Americans reported being financially fragile, with a remarkable 50% of African Americans falling into that category. To combat the negative effects of COVID-19 on personal finances, the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center built a financial resilience hub that includes resources on managing debt, protecting credit scores, and rebuilding precautionary savings, all of which can be critical strategies for financially vulnerable populations. Although the CARES Act suspended payment and interest on many student loans, some older federal loans and private loans are not eligible for this relief. Borrowers should check the status of their loans to determine whether their loans have been suspended, as well as review their credit scores to verify that payments were not reported as deferred or delinquent. Once payments resume, borrowers may want to consider income-driven repayment plans which can reduce monthly payments and increase affordability. To mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19, workers should explore programs available through their employers and benefit providers. Many employers have financial education resources and support programs to help employees and their families cope with the current crisis. The CARES Act made it easier for workers with savings in a retirement plan to withdraw money for short-term needs if they are facing financial stress. Rebuilding emergency savings, which many employers offer programs for, is another option. Treating your future as a creditor—to be paid before any discretionary spending decisions are made—is the key to saving. To map out financial plans during the current crisis and to prepare for future crises, individuals should aim for stability in three key areas: insurance (e.g., health, life, property), estate planning (e.g., will, medical directive), and cash reserves to protect against job loss. Investment portfolios should be moved into somewhat more conservative assets. Because of its high interest rates, credit card debt should only be used as a last resort. For people who are financially squeezed, they should tap into retirement assets or other savings before going further into debt. Moreover, in general, it is not a good idea to claim your Social Security benefits in response to the crisis unless you are out of other options.",

According to a new survey by the Census Bureau, one third of Americans are showing signs of anxiety or depression since before the pandemic. This staggering statistic highlights an urgent need to address a crisis that has largely been unmet in the United States. Moreover, COVID-19 is not only disproportionately affecting communities of color but also exposing racial and ethnic disparities in access to mental health care. According to SAMHSA, nearly 67% of Latino and 69% of Black Americans did not receive treatment for mental illness in 2018 compared to 56.7% of the general population. As more Americans use emergency rooms and primary care providers to access mental and physical care services, we recommend policymakers focus on promoting integrated models of care that have proven successful in reducing health disparities and providing comprehensive services to those struggling with mental health conditions. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality defines integrated behavioral and primary care as a team of primary providers and behavioral health clinicians working together, along with patients and their families, to provide patient-centered care. Research shows that integrating these services improves access to care and treatment outcomes, lowers rates of mortality, and potentially reduces healthcare costs by $38 billion to $68 billion annually. However, there have been significant inequalities in the treatment and insurance coverage of mental health compared to physical health in the U.S., creating a fragmented system. To be sure, the effects of social distancing, economic insecurity, and uncertainty about the future course of COVID-19 are taking a toll on Americans’ mental health and well-being. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that the pandemic is causing fear and worry about one’s own health or the health of loved ones, changes in sleep and eating patterns, worsening of chronic health and mental health conditions, and an increased use of alcohol, tobacco, or other illicit drugs. In fact, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency Disaster Distress Helpline received 11 times more calls in April 2020 than in April 2019. The psychological effects of the pandemic are further straining our nation’s health care system, which continues to grapple with insufficient access to care for those with existing mental health issues. However, many Americans will experience mental health and substance use disorders for the first time. Prior to the pandemic, one in eight emergency room visits were related to mental health or substance use issues, a proportion which will certainly increase. Those who have not experienced mental health conditions previously may not be aware of the physical symptoms that might also be present. For example, anxiety may come with palpitations, sweating, or nausea. Some may not recognize that these symptoms can be caused by an underlying mental health issue and may seek care from primary care providers or emergency rooms for their physical symptoms. Integrated care has the potential to meet these demands&hellip;",

    "content": "The most vulnerable in our society—the 567,000 people that experience homelessness on any given night—continue to be at higher risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus given their limited ability to safely shelter in place. Government-enforced stay-at-home orders have also resulted in an unprecedented disruption to the labor market, with 44.2 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March. Despite a slight rebound in May, the unemployment rate remained historically high at 13.3% and a protracted recovery is expected. With 10.7 million households paying more than half their incomes on rent, lost jobs and crucial household wages are a primary concern as eviction moratoriums expire. The pandemic’s financial impact has been borne disproportionately by minority households, as BPC found in a recent nationwide poll. Responses showed that Black and Hispanic households experienced higher job losses and pay-cuts, were more likely to tap into emergency savings, and more likely to miss household payments (including mortgage, credit card, utility, or rent payments) in response to COVID-19. These disproportionate impacts are critically important considering that people of color already faced higher housing cost burdens, housing insecurity, evictions, and poverty than white households. Moreover, COVID-19 kills Black Americans at twice the rate as white individuals. Given the urgent need to stably house Americans until the public health threat of COVID-19 diminishes and limit its disproportionate impact on low-income families and people of color, BPC has developed the following policy recommendations for immediate action: Even with the direct cash payments to households and expanded unemployment insurance benefits provided by the CARES Act, paying rent is a growing challenge. As eviction moratoriums end, millions will be put at risk of homelessness. Lawmakers should embrace a multifaceted approach to prevent a wave of evictions and the potentially devastating health and economic consequences that would follow by providing unemployment benefits; funding additional housing vouchers, targeted to the lowest income households; creating a new program for one-time rent and utility assistance; and offering forgivable loans or tax credits to landlords facing lost rental income. Expanding and extending moratoriums on evictions may also be warranted, particularly in COVID-19 hotspots or if coupled with funding to help housing providers cover financial obligations. Not acting quickly to prevent evictions threatens to displace a large share of low-income renters, who are disproportionately people of color. We have all been affected by COVID-19, yet some in our society are more vulnerable to both the virus and its devastating social and economic impacts, including low-income older adults, such as seniors in HUD-assisted and other congregate housing; those with underlying health conditions, including mental illness and substance use disorders; and those experiencing homelessness, in temporary housing, or who are housing insecure. To meet the needs of low-income older adults and other vulnerable populations, policymakers should focus on improving coordination between health and housing officials at every level of government; openly sharing data and information; screening and facilitating access to COVID-19 testing; and providing emergency federal funding for service coordinators, telemental health, meal and food delivery programs,&hellip;",

    "content": "Measures such as physical distancing and stay -at -home orders have been essential to flattening the curve of COVID-19. As the nation enters the sixth month of the pandemic, there is increasing concern about the effect these steps are having on other public health issues, including substance use disorder and mental health conditions. Both the novel coronavirus pandemic and the opioid epidemic are public health emergencies declared under the authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, but each pose unique challenges as the pandemic meets the epidemic. There is little doubt COVID-19 is taking a toll on the nation’s mental well-being. A recent Johns Hopkins survey found a more than three-fold increase in psychological distress since the beginning of the pandemic. What is less well known is the effect the pandemic is having on opioid overdose morbidity and mortality. That’s because the United States lacks a national, real-time database to track overdoses or overdose deaths, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly what is happening. We do know, however, that recently reported overdose spikes may reverse the slight decrease in the rate of opioid involved overdose deaths, according to 2018 data released earlier this year by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Scattered reports have emerged from Erie County, New York to King County, Washington of spikes in overdoses during COVID-19. Additional areas experiencing spikes are included in a recently released OD-MAP report. It includes overdose reports from selected areas of the country and found overdose submissions to their database up 20% since the United States reported its first coronavirus case in January 2020. The report also includes information from January, before stay-at-home orders were in place, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact circumstances leading to increased overdoses. There are a number of possible reasons for increased overdoses, and public reports do not always distinguish between overdoses and overdose deaths. Circumstances may include the closure or reduction in syringe services programs, an important source of harm reduction services such as the opioid antidote naloxone and other health care services. A recent survey of syringe services programs in the United States found that 43% had reduced their services in the past few months. Other possible reasons for increased overdoses include an increase in using drugs while being alone, changes in the drug supply, or decreased calls to first responders. Some health care procedures have been postponed due to stay-at-home orders but delaying or suspending treatment and harm reduction services for mental health conditions and substance use disorders can be life threatening. Recognizing this, both the federal and state governments have responded with regulatory changes to treatment delivery services for substance use and mental health conditions. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) swiftly moved to temporarily revise regulations to ensure continuity of care when many other services are disrupted. The recent regulatory changes made by the DEA and SAMHSA include increased access to telehealth, as well as allowing take-home doses&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought absentee and by-mail voting to the forefront of national attention in ways few could have predicted. BPC elections experts predict that as many as 70 percent of all ballots cast in the November election will be cast by mail. As rates of absentee and mail voting increase, some government officials have raised concerns that more mail voting will lead to widespread voter fraud. Not only are rates of voter fraud extremely low, but even before the pandemic all states allowed some form of absentee voting, with the majority of states allowing no-excuse absentee voting or all-mail voting (also called vote-by-mail or VBM). We sat down with three experienced state and local election officials and members of BPC’s Task Force on Elections to better understand the precautions that they take to make sure the absentee voting process is secure and reliable. Below are some highlights of our conversations, edited for clarity. Each of the three election officials said the most common myth about absentee voting is that mail-in ballots are more susceptible to voter fraud. Colorado’s Elections Director Judd Choate reflected that when asked about mail-in fraud, he likes to “tell the counter story.” “People who vote in person sometimes don’t update their addresses, even when they have moved. But because it’s an in person voting model, the state or county doesn’t go to great extremes to keep lists clean.” In comparison, jurisdictions with all-mail elections must constantly update voters’ addresses to ensure that the right voters receive the right ballots. As a result, when a person moves, they are unlikely to get the wrong ballot by mail, whereas an in-person voter with an outdated address could be going to the wrong polling place for years. Choate summarized: “In that way, vote-by-mail actually reduces fraud instead of promoting it.” Based on her experience as Washington State’s Director of Elections, Lori Augino added that “Of the nearly 3.2 million ballots cast , only 0.004% of the total ballots cast may have been fraudulent.” According to Washington’s Lori Augino, “The linchpin of our security is signature verification.” “Every single signature on every single ballot that is returned to a county election official is checked against the signature on file in a voter’s registration record. This enables officials to do to two things: (1) ensure the ballot was returned by an eligible voter, and (2) if the signature on the ballot envelope does not match the signature on file, it gives the voter a chance to either update their record or alert election officials that the ballot returned may be fraudulent.” San Diego County’s Registrar of Voters Michael Vu added that in addition to conducting signature verification, he takes the following precautions: Using an election management system to track every ballot issued and prevent double voting. Updating voter registration lists daily to ensure the voter’s correct residence address and mailing address is on file. Sending out mailers to determine if a person has moved. Have&hellip;",

    "content": "The most recent jobs report might indicate the country is emerging from the coronavirus-induced economic crisis, but policymakers focused on recovery should continue to build upon recently adopted policies like paid sick and family leave to help women get back in the workforce and balance the demands of work and family. While the pandemic did not create gender inequality, it exacerbated the challenges women—especially women of color—face regularly. Women continue to experience higher levels of unemployment, shoulder an unequal share of household chores, risk their health as frontline workers, and face dropping out of the workforce as a result of these pressures. Women ultimately bear both the brunt of the economic fallout from COVID-19 and the responsibility of carrying the country through the pandemic. How policymakers respond to this will dictate whether women can achieve work-life balance and whether the country can expect a speedy economic recovery. Congress should expand coverage and eligibility for paid sick and family leave provisions under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Here’s why: Since the pandemic hit, nearly two-thirds of frontline workers are women, occupying jobs such as health care (76.8 percent), child and social services (85.2 percent), cashiers (71.8 percent), retail salespersons (63.5 percent), and customer service representatives (63.7 percent). Of these industries, two—health care and cashiers—carry some of the greatest risk from COVID-19 transmission. Black women make up nearly one-third of all nursing assistants and home health aides. Meanwhile, Latinas and Native American women are concentrated in low-wage jobs such as customer service representatives and cashiers. And because many workers were excluded from the emergency paid sick and family leave provisions due to employer-size exemptions and carve-outs, health care workers and cashiers most directly at risk have little to no access to paid sick and family leave. If these women or a family member becomes sick or they have a minor child at home, the struggle to balance work and family life is significant. For women who are both essential workers in low-wage occupations and single parents, the challenges are even steeper. They can’t afford to lose any portion of their income, are often unable to work from home, and are far less likely to have access to paid leave or child care. In 2019, only 6 percent of the lowest-wage workers had access to paid family leave compared to 34 percent of the highest-wage workers, and Latinos had the least access to any form of paid leave. Although women make up most of the essential workforce, they are also overrepresented in industries hit hardest by unemployment. According to Labor Department data for the month of May, 14.5 percent of women remain unemployed compared to 11.6 percent for men. And the unemployment rate was higher for Latinas (19 percent) and Black women (16.5 percent). This is no surprise given women largely occupy industries hit hardest by the pandemic: accommodations and food services industry and the health care and social assistance industry. A separate household survey found that women of color make up&hellip;",

This month’s Big Reads include a major report from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences about trends in the humanities, disciplines essential for preparing graduates to contextualize current events and controversies. The report includes data about declining enrollments and elimination of humanities disciplines as major fields of study at many institutions. Snow College Faculty Senate Resolution Affirming the Chicago Principles Faculty Senate | Snow College | April 2020 Despite the turmoil of COVID-19 disruptions to campus life, the faculty senate of Snow College became the latest institutional body to endorse the Chicago Principles. It is the first school in Utah to do so and joins a list of over 70 other institutions that have formally adopted the principles.

That function is desperately needed now as we confront the deep-rooted racial and economic disparities that have been brought to the fore by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and so many others. Yet, we also must recognize that as an institution, Congress has not always given voice to everyone’s views. The voices of people of color have too rarely been centered in debates, particularly on those issues most important to them. As the House and Senate, and all of our political leaders, move toward healing the nation, we must better live up to America’s core values and hold our elected officials accountable to their duties and obligations. On June 10th, the House Judiciary Committee will hold an oversight hearing on “Policing Practices and Law Enforcement Accountability.” This is likely the first of several hearings that will precede consideration of expected policing reform legislation. The Congress Project of the Bipartisan Policy Center does not expect these debates to be apolitical or devoid of conflict and disagreement. We do believe, however, that the debates can be more productive than those of recent years. Some committees have regularly set the example for how to achieve this. Their practices should be followed by all and include: Consultation between the majority and minority on hearing topics Joint briefings between the majority and minority prior to hearings to establish a common understanding of facts and an understanding of disagreements Seeking agreement on the purpose and goals of a hearing Bipartisan agreement on the selection of witnesses Before identifying solutions, focus on surfacing a diversity of experiences in society and the facts of the problems The House Rules Committee recently demonstrated this model in a hearing on constitutional responsibility and authority of the legislative branch. Additionally, for the past year and a half, the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress has been a model for thorough legislative factfinding and productive legislating.

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic and economic shutdown that followed emphasized how critical broadband access is—with many Americans transitioning to telework and online learning, and telehealth services becoming vital in reducing the risk of coronavirus transmission.Yet over 24 million Americans do not have access to fixed broadband service at threshold speeds, 80% of which live in rural and tribal communities (Figure 1). Expanding broadband services to currently underserved communities has the potential to create lasting economic, educational, and health benefits. Perhaps less apparent, yet no less important, the expansion of broadband connectivity can also contribute to mitigating and adapting to the risks of climate change. Here we discuss four key connections between rural broadband and climate change, and how Congress can put Americans back to work by expanding and increasing access to rural broadband infrastructure. 1. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is the use of modern information technologies for on-farm data collection and analysis to inform decision-making for improved resource use efficiency, yield, quality, profitability, and sustainability of agricultural production. Precision technologies can enable climate-friendly farming by increasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural operations. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine estimates that the United States can store 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year through cropland and rangeland soil practices that protect and enhance soil organic matter. Precision agriculture helps do this, for example, through the use of variable rate technology to optimize the application of organic amendments and minimize erosion from irrigation. According to a review of precision agriculture technologies, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced through lowered fuel consumption from fewer tractor operations and reduced fertilizer for field operations. Nitrogen fertilizer releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential nearly 300 times that of carbon dioxide. Optimizing nitrogen fertilizer application through precision technology could significantly reduce on-farm nitrous oxide emissions, as well as improve water quality by reducing nitrogen runoff from farmland. Precision agriculture technologies also include machine guidance, remote sensing, in-field electronic sensors, and spatial data management systems. Farmers can use machine guidance to automatically steer agricultural equipment through in-cab computer controllers. Remotely sensed images taken by satellite and in-field electronic sensors allow farmers to assess field conditions remotely, and the collected data can be managed in spatial data management systems, such as GIS. Access to broadband is just the base level for entry into precision agriculture. To practice precision agriculture, farmers must also purchase equipment, such as soil sensors and fertilizer systems with variable application rates, that utilize broadband services. Rural broadband buildout opens the door to precision agriculture by allowing farmers access and the opportunity to connect. 2. Precision Forestry Precision forestry is the use of digital technologies—such as drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), lidar, and soil sensors—to improve forest management results. Broadband access facilitates data collection and analysis from precision forestry technologies, helping forest managers to streamline processes and practice climate-friendly forestry in three key ways. First, using similar methods to precision agriculture,&hellip;",

    "content": "In June 2020, President Donald Trump signed into law the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, intended to address complaints from many businesses concerned about the restrictions and short spending period of the original PPP enacted in March. Though many small businesses have documented challenges, child care programs in particular have had a difficult time accessing and benefiting from the PPP. For more on the specifics of this program, please see our explainer here, as well as a brief about how interim updates may have helped child care businesses access the program. The changes included in the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act are as follows: Extension of the time period businesses must spend the loan money from eight weeks to 24 weeks (or through the end of December) while remaining eligible for forgiveness Extension of the time period which an employer must increase employment or rehire until the end of December, which otherwise could result in the reduction of the forgivable amount of the loan Inclusion of an exemption to the forgivable loan amount determined by full-time equivalent employees, if businesses can show (1) inability to rehire or hire similarly qualified employees, or (2) inability to return to same level of business activity due to compliance with federal guidance related to COVID-19 Reduction of the amount of loan funds which must be spent on payroll, as compared to rent or utilities. The payroll portion of a forgivable covered loan is lowered from the previous requirement of 75%, to 60% Establishes a minimum maturity of five years, instead of the two, for a PPP loan with a remaining balance to be paid, after forgiveness Allows recipients to defer loan payments until they receive compensation for forgiven amounts Eliminates a provision which stated loan recipients who have forgiven indebtedness will be ineligible to defer payroll tax payments. The payroll tax deferral will now be available to all PPP borrowers This legislation did not add funding to the program, which was originally funded at $359 billion. As funds quickly ran out, additional appropriations were authorized for a total of $660 billion for lending. As of the end of May, the program had at least $130 billion in remaining funds available for lending. The impact of these flexibilities will help businesses with high rent and utility costs utilize the loan, given the required percentage spent on payroll decreased from 75% to 60%. Further, the extension of the program from eight to 24 weeks will allow more businesses to apply for PPP.",

    "content": "The Disaster Recovery Reform Act became law in October 2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-254). Importantly, it authorized a new Federal Emergency Management Agency program, Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC), to reduce the risk associated with natural disasters by investing grant funding in public infrastructure projects before disasters hit. Unlike the pre-disaster mitigation program that BRIC is replacing, which was funded with annual discretionary appropriations, FEMA can set aside up to 6% of total estimated disaster expenditures associated with each presidential disaster declaration to fund BRIC. These funds will go into the National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund, with annual contributions fluctuating based on the number and cost of disasters in the prior year. FEMA has estimated that annual contributions will be between $300-$500 million. Source: FEMA As the latest step in BRIC’s development and implementation, FEMA released a draft policy on April 10 for public comment. Several Bipartisan Policy Center partners submitted letters with their input before the formal public comment period ended on May 11. FEMA will review all this information before it finalizes the proposed policy and begins accepting grant applications, which is expected this fall. While our partners offered up a wide range of recommendations and implementation priorities, below are a few areas of consensus: Prioritize natural infrastructure projects. Pew Charitable Trusts, the National Audobon Society, the Nature Conservancy, and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership all suggested that FEMA more intentionally prioritize natural infrastructure solutions for reducing risks from flooding and other hazards in its BRIC policy because such projects offer multiple benefits—including environmental, recreational, social, and economic benefits. Use BRIC to promote mitigation planning. Because many communities lack the technical, managerial, and financial capacity to assess hazard-related vulnerabilities, develop mitigation plans, and pull together project funding, several organizations focused on using BRIC for planning purposes. For example, the American Flood Coalition recommended that FEMA allow local governments to use BRIC funds for hazard mitigation planning, while Pew suggested that BRIC-supported hazard mitigation plans be fully incorporated into other types of community planning. Avoid duplication. There are many federal programs intended to help states and local governments fund and finance needed infrastructure projects. In their comment letter, Pew cautioned that BRIC dollars should not simply replace or add to established infrastructure funding sources. Instead, they should explicitly be directed to pre-disaster mitigation efforts. The Nature Conservancy recommended that FEMA build interagency partnerships to ensure that the best-designed projects are selected for funding. Accommodate the needs of disadvantaged and under-resourced communities. Our partners consistently acknowledged the disadvantages small, impoverished, and rural communities could face in the context of the BRIC program, offering ideas to make it easier for them to plan projects and get BRIC funding. Their recommendations included making local government eligible applicants for BRIC grants, adding more prescriptive public consultation requirements, allowing local officials to choose their own technical assistance providers, preferencing contracts with local, small businesses, tailoring program requirements and administrative burdens, and providing resources for planning, technical assistance, and capacity building.

    "content": "Safe, resilient, and developmentally appropriate child care facilities are essential to an early childhood system that promotes the health and well-being of the nation’s children and families. Yet facility infrastructure has been long neglected and many child care facilities around the country are in substandard condition. While there has been a longstanding need to invest in facility improvements, the pandemic has shown a need to prioritize these investments so programs can effectively implement guidance that may mitigate the risk of virus exposure. With these investments, we can move toward ensuring children and providers stay safe and healthy in child care settings, and that the nation builds back a stronger and more resilient child care system. In April 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance for child care that has remained open during the pandemic. Following this, in May 2020, the CDC released guidance to help providers reopen. For child care to reopen during this time, programs must take steps to reduce the risk of transmission, such as reducing class sizes, implementing enhanced sanitation and hygiene protocol, and introducing additional health checks. To do so effectively, however, may require facility upgrades and modifications that will lead to improved facility conditions as the nation recovers. Based on available guidance from the CDC, the following features of child care facilities should be considered as programs reopen: Self-contained classrooms to support social distancing. The CDC provides social distancing strategies for child care settings, which include reducing class group sizes, having children remain in the same class groups each day with the same providers, and limiting the use of communal space, such as cafeterias and large play areas. While social distancing is not developmentally appropriate for young children, efforts to limit interactions between children and providers can help reduce the risk of virus transmission. Self-contained classrooms, or classrooms with furnishings, equipment, and appliances located directly within the enclosed space—including toilet and diaper-changing areas and child-sized bathroom and activity sinks—are helpful in reducing viral transmission by keeping children and providers in the classroom throughout the day. These classrooms should include sufficient space for individually storing children’s belongings and bedding materials, a teacher resource station, and a meal preparation area that includes an adult-sized sink and dishwasher for sanitation purposes. The classroom size should also accommodate sufficient space for children to remain six feet apart during naptime. Other features of child care classrooms that are beneficial to children’s development, such as access to natural light and appropriate acoustic levels, should also be included in facility design. Additional classroom space to accommodate small group sizes. With guidance promoting small group sizes in child care settings, programs may be required to reduce the number of children served, which impacts both the business model and working parents’ access to child care.

    "content": "Washington, D.C. | June 8, 2020 – A new nationwide survey of likely voters conducted for the Bipartisan Policy Center and funded by The Rockefeller Foundation finds bipartisan support for reforms that support American workers and their families. The survey reveals that Americans want jobs restored and are looking for pragmatic solutions tethered to employment, such as unemployment insurance reform, benefit portability, and family leave benefits. The poll also finds Black and Hispanic households report unemployment and reduction of work hours at higher rates than white households. Additionally, higher percentages of Black and Hispanic households said they have tapped into savings in response to the financial hardships caused by the pandemic crisis. Black and Hispanic households also reported higher rates of taking actions, such as delaying bill payments or borrowing money, to lower household costs or increase income during the crisis. Three in four voters (76%) are not content to simply return to the same systems that existed prior to the COVID-19 economic crisis. However, most voters are not drawn to big systemic changes such as universal income, as much as they support pragmatic solutions tethered to employment, such as unemployment insurance reform, benefit portability, and family leave benefits. “An overwhelming percentage of voters from both parties want practical solutions that empower and protect America’s working families,” said BPC President Jason Grumet. “While demanding major change, voters also express skepticism about vast new government programs. These results should remind lawmakers that people want real jobs not empty promises.” “Far too many hard-working Americans were already living paycheck to paycheck before the pandemic, which has exposed the fragility of America’s social safety net,” said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation, which funded the poll. “This data shows that Americans don’t just want to go back to the way things were. They want changes to the American economy that enables their children and families to not just survive, but thrive.” Key findings include: Potential policy solutions Unemployment benefit reform: The poll found that 90% of Democrats, 87% of Republicans, and 89% of independents view favorably unemployment insurance reform, with a 62% majority of those who view it favorably saying benefit reform would make a “real and useful” difference in the lives of people they know. Licensing reform/scope of practice: Fully 86% of Democrats, 84% of Republicans, and 86% of all independents favor licensing reform, with a 59% majority of those who view it favorably saying it would make a “real and useful” difference in the lives of people they know. 401(k) portability &amp; multi-job coverage: Fully 86% of Democrats, 90% of Republicans, and an identical 90% of independents favor 401(k) retirement portability and multi-job coverage reform, with half (49%) saying 401(k) reform of this type would make a “real and useful” difference.

    "content": "COVID-19 emerged on American soil just as the primary election calendar swung into high gear, causing elected officials across the country to grapple with a tough choice – go forward with an election and risk public health, or delay or cancel the primary during a heated presidential election. Many states relied on existing emergency powers, which were untested with respect to modifying elections, to delay and alter the voting process. But differences in state law, uncertainty about lines of authority, and a lack of transparency in decision making caused public confusion, impacted voter confidence, and threatened the legitimacy of the electoral process. Moreover, unchecked unilateral changes in election dates and methods can set potentially dangerous precedents. With the November election potentially impacted by the ongoing crisis, states must clarify emergency powers with regards to elections or risk undermining confidence in the legitimacy of our elections. Emergency powers were used by state executives to single-handedly change election dates and procedures for the duration of the declared emergency. While all U.S. states have declared states of emergency due to the pandemic, there are disparities among states in what entity or entities truly wields emergency authority over elections. Out of the 44 primaries in 2020, 18 states postponed their primaries or changed their election structure for safety purposes (see table below). Twelve of these states used emergency powers to postpone the primary. Most often, the governor issued an executive order, but in a small handful, other state officials – the Health Director in Ohio and the Secretary of State in Georgia and Kentucky – used their authority to postpone or cancel a primary. In four other states, decisions to postpone the election were not made using emergency authority. Political parties and local election officials agreed to postpone party primaries in two states, which is only possible when the primary exclusively contains presidential primary races. If there are state races on the ballot as well, then parties do not have the authority to postpone. State legislatures passed bills postponing the primary in two additional states. Emergency powers are essential to governance in times of crisis, but too many states have unclear rules about how elections should be conducted in a state of emergency and who has authority to make changes to existing election procedures. Without explicit legal authority spelled out into law, election legitimacy may falter simply from too many decision-makers battling for the final say. This was especially clear in the case of Ohio’s primary election. The night before Ohio’s scheduled primary on March 17th, chaos ensued as “it appeared the election was off, back on, and then off again.” While Governor Mike DeWine, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, and the Ohio Supreme Court clashed over whether to delay the primary, Ohio’s health director used a little-known emergency power to close in-person polling places and ultimately delay the election. This back and forth caused immense confusion for voters, many of whom woke up on what they thought was Election Day only to find&hellip;",

    "content": "Emergency expansions of unemployment insurance have been a central part of America’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing economic crisis. With one component of that expansion—an across-the-board, $600 increase in weekly benefits—set to lapse at the end of July, lawmakers must soon decide whether to allow it to expire, extend it, or otherwise alter it going forward. As local officials begin to relax stay-at-home orders and the country pivots from crisis to recovery, public policy must also transition from providing relief to rebuilding the economy. Accordingly, when and how to scale back the emergency UI expansions are among the most important decisions that Congress faces over the coming months. While UI benefits must continue to provide robust relief to those who are unable to work for reasons related to COVID-19, the program should also be modified in a way that incentivizes work. The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented workforce challenges that the regular UI program is not designed to handle. Government-enforced stay-at-home orders implemented to contain COVID-19 have led to shuttered businesses and tens of millions of layoffs and furloughs. Although employment rebounded somewhat in May, the unemployment rate remained historically high at 13.3%, and at best, the labor market is only at the beginning of a long road to recovery. Personal health and family caregiving challenges have compounded these labor market woes. As a result, an unprecedented share of adults is either out of work or facing reduced income, often with no opportunity to seek—or little prospect of finding—further employment in the near term. With modest monthly benefits and a requirement that recipients look for work, UI is traditionally designed to support and encourage the transition of laid off workers into new jobs, not provide relief to those displaced from work for non-economic reasons. The emergency expansions to UI enacted under the CARES Act are crucially filling these gaps, providing financial assistance to workers who have been impacted by COVID-19 and temporarily displaced from their jobs due to no fault of their own. The additional $600 weekly benefit is helping families make ends meet in an environment where the virus and policies to combat it have eliminated many reemployment opportunities. These additional benefits have also facilitated compliance with stay-at-home orders, protecting personal health and mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Importantly, the CARES Act also expanded UI eligibility to include self-employed workers and independent contractors, furloughed workers, and those who quit their jobs or are unable to work for reasons brought on by COVID-19. With the public health and economic outlook highly uncertain, there is a clear need to continue providing robust support to households that have lost wages. Come August, benefits should remain elevated from their standard level to account for the fact that COVID-19 and the policy response to it has curtailed any chance for many dislocated workers to search for or find new jobs in the immediate future. Moreover, even after stay-at-home orders are lifted, vulnerable populations may be unable (or feel that it is unsafe)&hellip;",

    "content": "President Donald Trump has used his executive order pen quite a bit on immigration during his presidency. Most recently, he has used it to deny entry to most immigrant visa applicants from abroad to protect Americans who have lost jobs due to coronavirus from the “impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market.” And according to reports, the White House is considering a new executive order restricting visas for temporary workers that will likely make similar economic arguments to explain why the entry of these nonimmigrants would hurt the prospects of U.S. workers. Nonimmigrant visas under consideration for the order include H-1B, H-2B, H-2A, optional practical training work authorization, and summer work-travel programs for foreign students. However, blanket bans on immigrants or certain nonimmigrant visa categories do not recognize that even in the current COVID-19 economic downturn, there may still be a need to shore up essential or ongoing industries that have experienced challenges recruiting or retaining sufficient U.S. workers. Industries that the administration has deemed essential, including agriculture, meat and poultry processing, and grocery retail and delivery, employ disproportionately more immigrants than native-born American workers. Additionally, the number of new immigrants admitted each year for all purposes is tiny compared to the number of unemployed Americans, so they are unlikely to have a very big impact on the availability of jobs for Americans in any case. Furthermore, many unemployed Americans expect to be rehired as the economy rebounds, meaning they are not looking for other jobs. Recent BPC/Morning Consult polling showed that unemployed voters were less likely to support immigration bans or to think that they will result in protecting American jobs. Still, majorities of Americans support Trump’s immigration ban in the current environment, so we must ask why. It may be due, at least in part, to the fact that very few voters can link how the immigration system works to an economic benefit, even if many studies have shown that, in the aggregate, immigrants are good for the economy. The recent BPC/Morning Consult survey showed American voters deeply split over whether immigrants would help or hurt with the economic recovery from COVID-19. The current system is locked in statute, including prioritizing admission based on family relationships, not on work or economic needs. And the system seems to have little direct ability to respond to current economic conditions like focusing on shortage occupations or adjusting immigration numbers to objective data. These aspects of the system do not help the public believe that the system helps the economy. Other countries make a much more explicit connection between their immigration systems and the country’s economic needs. In BPC’s report examining five other countries’ temporary to permanent immigration systems, most had a combination of ways to ensure that temporary or permanent migrants supported the economy and did not hurt the domestic labor market. These mechanisms included skills tests, salary floors, union approval over new hires, individual employer labor market recruitment tests, and shortage occupation lists.

    "content": "In May, the Trump administration began screening Guatemalan nationals being deported to Guatemala for COVID-19. Although this news suggests that the White House has been actively working with Guatemala to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the region, these measures only emerged after the Guatemalan government pushed back against the administration’s pressure to accept deportees regardless of their health conditions. This struggle encapsulates administration’s approach to the region, which has placed strains on the immigration and health systems in the Northern Triangle. The struggle over deportations to Guatemala emerged from the administration’s efforts to force the Northern Triangle countries to prioritize immigration concerns over halting the spread of COVID-19. In mid-March, Guatemala suspended the Asylum Cooperative Agreement that allowed the United States to send asylum-seekers from other countries to Guatemala and began introducing other measures to limit or halt the reception of deported Guatemalan nationals. The Guatemalan government stated that half of Guatemalan deportees had COVID-19 and formed 15% of all nationwide COVID-19 cases. Although El Salvador suspended the reception of Salvadoran deportees in mid-March, it reversed course by April. The Trump administration has used both sticks and carrots to push these countries to accept deportees amidst the pandemic. On April 10, the administration issued a memo threatening visa sanctions against countries that refused to receive deportations of their nationals. President Trump subsequently announced that he would send ventilators to El Salvador and Honduras if they curbed illegal immigration. The recent publication of the Honduran version of the Asylum Cooperative Agreement in the Federal Register, the first step in implementing the deal, reinforces the administration’s wresting of immigration help from these countries. The administration’s strong-arm approach towards these countries this spring marks a continuation of Trump’s regional immigration strategy. In June 2019, the administration suspended $550 million in congressionally-appropriated development aid for the three Northern Triangle countries over their perceived failure to reduce an influx of Central American migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. The countries subsequently signed bilateral asylum agreements that allowed the United States to send back asylum-seekers to their territories for asylum processing. The Trump administration expanded the number of H-2A visas for Guatemalan nationals and reinstated a reported $143 million in aid to reward the countries’ compliance with its immigration priorities. This quid pro quo approach is counterproductive in two ways. Rather than improving the ability of the United States to adjudicate asylum claims, it forces Northern Triangle countries to be responsible for this process, placing significant strains on their immigration systems. For instance, in early March the Guatemalan government requested the United States limit the number of people sent there under the ACA after the number of returnees exceeded the country’s ability to process them. Without additional assistance and resources to support their own asylum processes, the administration’s policy fails to create a strategy where every country can effectively contribute to migration management based on their existing capacity. This approach also places strains on the countries’ healthcare systems. Although Central American governments have restricted travel&hellip;",

    "content": "As states loosen COVID-19 restrictions and businesses reopen, workers across the country are struggling to get back to work. Without child care or paid family leave, many families are forced to turn down work and remain home as schools, child care centers, adult day care, and summer camps remain shut. This breakdown in caregiving is also hurting the ability of businesses—particularly small businesses owners reeling from the rapid decline in revenue—to restart operations. Even before the pandemic, U.S. states and firms were losing billions in economic or business activity due to breakdowns in child care. In March, Congress tried addressing this gap with the passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). The bill provides two benefits: paid sick and paid family leave. Workers can have access to 10 weeks of emergency paid family leave and 10 days (80 hours) of emergency paid sick leave. In turn, it reimburses small and midsize companies with dollar-for-dollar tax credits for the cost of providing leave wages to their employees. Both workers and employers have access to these emergency provisions from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Workers should be able to navigate the difficulties of sickness or family caregiving without fearing the risk of losing their job or livelihood. Employers should understand that at no point are they expected to provide an additional cash outlay for employee&#8217;s leave wages—payment for wages will come directly out of the employer’s payroll tax liability. In instances when the cost of leave payments do exceed the total corporate payroll expense, the IRS is committed to a two-week refund. Though implementing these benefits will undoubtedly create an administrative burden, employers should find that the structure of the tax law puts minimal financial stress on business operations. And while the FFCRA law does not apply to everyone, workers and employers who qualify for emergency leave benefits should understand what it means for them. To help you get up to speed, here’s what you need to know. What paid leave benefits do I have access to? COVID-19 Family Leave: You can take 12 weeks (2 weeks unpaid, 10 weeks paid) of family leave to care for your child under 18 years of age if your child’s school or child care provider is closed or unavailable due to COVID-19 related reasons from April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. You must be employed for at least 30 days to take leave and the weeks of paid leave will be paid at two-thirds the regular rate of pay, but payments may not exceed $200 per day and $10,000 in the aggregate. COVID-19 Sick Leave: You can take two weeks (80 hours) of paid sick leave to recover from or care for a family member due to COVID-19 related reasons from April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The weeks of paid leave will be paid at your regular rate of pay (full wages) if taking leave to self-quarantine or recover from COVID-19, but payments may not exceed $511 per day&hellip;",

    "content": "COVID-19 has brought the fragility of the child care market to the national forefront, highlighting both the important role child care plays allowing parents to work and the instability of our country’s child care businesses. As governors sought to control community-spread of COVID-19, stay-at-home orders closed businesses for all but essential personnel. As a result, hundreds of thousands of child care programs closed as Main Street and Wall Street shuttered, schools closed, and parents&#8217; demand for care declined. Unlike our schools, which are publicly funded institutions, child care is a business, largely paid for by parent fees. At the same time, child care is a public good. This has never been more evident than in recent weeks, and out of sheer necessity, states had to move quickly to provide child care to children of essential personnel. States also raced to change long-held state subsidy payment policies related to supporting low-wage families and began paying for child care based on enrollment of a child in a program rather than attendance. To ensure programs were available after the pandemic, some even increased subsidy rates and provided staff bonuses. This shift in payment policies was the first recognition of the need for child care as a public good and to ensure the entire industry did not collapse. It was a temporary bridge to help stabilize the market. As we look beyond the current COVID-19 crisis, we must re-examine how the public funding of child care is handled so that we can build back better. In fiscal year 2020, Congress allocated about $8.7 billion to states through the Child Care and Development Fund to support child care access for low-wage families. This represents about one-fifth of the $48 billion in annual child care revenue and makes the government the single largest purchaser of child care, paying for the care of more than 1.3 million children each month. These payments are made through state-set subsidies that are distributed through certificates or vouchers. States set both family income eligibility as well as subsidy rates—or the value of the certificates. By law, states must promote parental choice across a range of settings including center-based care, home-based care, and faith-based programs, in a manner that supports equal access by ensuring subsidy payments are sufficient to ensure low-income families have access to comparable services provided to children whose parents are not eligible to receive child care assistance. Federal regulations do not require states to pay specific payment rates. Instead, states are required to conduct a market rate survey at least every three years and use the results to set subsidy rates. Subject to approval, states also have an option to conduct an alternative methodology, such as cost modeling, however, only the District of Columbia has applied. To promote equal access, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends that rates be set at the 75th percentile of market rates meaning that parents have choices among 75% of child care providers within a community but does not require it.

    "content": "On the Bipartisan Policy Center’s May 2020 virtual forum “What Worked, What Didn&#8217;t, What&#8217;s Next?”, state child care policymakers discussed their states’ responses to COVID-19 within the child care system. Although the 10 participating states had enormous variation in terms of COVID-19’s impact, geographic density, and population size, a striking theme emerged in the conversation. Both during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and as economies are reopening, parents are showing a strong preference for family child care programs for their children. States shared that this trend includes essential service workers who have continued to work during COVID-19 and employees returning to work in a reopening economy. Family child care, inclusive of licensed family child care programs and group child care home programs, offers characteristics that parents trust during COVID-19, such as small group sizes, recognizable residential settings, and neighborhood locations close to where parents live. In New York, the epicenter of COVID-19 now taking tentative steps toward reopening, parents are leaning on smaller, more familiar child care program types to reopen their economy. “In New York, we have approximately 37% of our total providers closed,” said Janice Molnar, deputy commissioner of the Division of Child Care Services in the New York State Office of Children and Family Services. “Where families seem to be gravitating are the family-based programs—family child care and group child care programs. Yes, there are some closures, but not as steep as center-based programs. We believe it is related to parents’ notions of safety, wanting to guard against infections, and staying near home. Especially in areas like New York City, where public transportation has become highly problematic, travelling to child care is much more difficult than previously.” In Massachusetts, all child care programs were closed in March and the state opened an emergency child care system that included both center-based child care and family child care programs. “The interesting part about the 550 programs that are running under our emergency child care is that it represents about 7-8% of our system that is up and running and we have yet to reach 50% of our fill rate,” said Samantha Aigner-Treworgy, commissioner of Massachusetts&#8217; Department of Early Education and Care, offering that parents appeared reluctant to place their children in congregant care settings. Although, she said, “that is not true across the entire state. We have pockets of high demand in family child care with smaller group sizes.” Utah’s state administrator echoed similar findings in communities during COVID-19. “At the outset of , 40% of our licensed centers had temporarily closed and a quarter of our licensed family programs had closed. We are now at closure rates at about 21% of our centers and 8% of our family providers,” said Tracy Gruber, director of the Office of Child Care at the Utah Department of Workforce Services. “Like other states, we are seeing a larger level of comfort of families being in smaller types of care settings. We are also happy to see a lot of programs are reopening&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our economy and, in particular, on our nation’s small businesses. Most businesses have been forced to close due to government shutdown orders, and many have had to lay off or furlough their employees in the process. Child care businesses and workers, essential to the operation every other sector of the economy, have not been spared. As our nation begins to lift stay-at-home orders, the ability for child care businesses to reopen will have a direct correlation to the ability for all other businesses to rebound and parents to return to work. Child care is a cornerstone of our economy and a prerequisite for parents to participate in the workforce. Businesses cannot rely on their employees if employees cannot rely on a child care business to look after their children while they are at work. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, 60% of child care programs have temporarily closed and without financial support, many of these programs might not survive. The Paycheck Protection Program was created by Congress to provide financial support to small businesses, including child care businesses, to help them weather this crisis. The program offers financial assistance to ensure businesses can continue to pay their staff, cover rent and utilities, and ultimately open their doors again once they are able to safely. Unfortunately, the PPP has several structural deficiencies that prohibit our nation’s most essential small business—child care—to access the program and benefit from its support. In an April survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children of 5,000 child care providers, 53% of child care centers and 25% of home-based providers had applied for a PPP loan, despite skepticism from majority of providers about the potential for forgiveness. A follow-up survey of 500 applicants found that just half were approved for PPP loans. Approval rates for home-based providers were even lower, which is concerning given the majority of child care businesses are home-based, and they are also more likely to remain open during this crisis than child care centers. Even providers who have been in business for decades, such as the Braithburn Academy in Washington State, report difficulty accessing the PPP and uncertainty about if it would truly meet their needs. Child care businesses and their employees are both hurt by the program’s shortcomings. As the nation’s unemployment rate has risen to levels rarely recorded—nearly 15% in April—child care workers have fared much worse. In fact, fully one-third of the child care workforce has lost their job since the pandemic began, nearly double the already striking national unemployment rate. This also indicates that child care businesses are having a greater difficulty keeping their employees on payroll through a PPP loan or other means, than many other business sectors. As Congress considers how to continue supporting small businesses, the backbone of our economy, it must recognize how the PPP has failed to substantially support our most essential small businesses: child care. Child care businesses that have applied have reported challenges accessing loans, difficulty working with banks, and logistical&hellip;",

    "content": "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many borrowers were struggling to repay their student loan debt, with nearly two out of five (39%) outstanding loans in the federally-managed portfolio either delinquent or in default in 2019. The crisis has exacerbated this challenge, and in response, Congress acted swiftly to support student borrowers through the temporary suspension of monthly payments and interest accruals on most federal student loans as part of the CARES Act. Unfortunately, roughly 11% of federal student loans were left out of the package, along with all private loans, generating confusion and leaving millions of student loan borrowers with inadequate relief. One major shortfall with the bill is that it failed to address more than 8 million borrowers with certain types of federal loans. Specifically, many borrowers with loans through the Family Federal Education Loan Program (FFEL) and the Federal Perkins Loan Program are ineligible for benefits under the CARES Act. What sets these loans apart is that they are not owned by the federal government. Rather, while the government guarantees these loans against default, they have been issued by private lenders, nonprofit organizations, state entities, or, in some cases, the schools that borrowers attended. With the headlines reporting relief for federal student loans, many borrowers are likely unaware that they are still required to meet their monthly payment obligations. Moreover, borrowers commonly hold multiple loans, meaning some borrowers may have both federal loans that are suspended and other federal loans that are not, making the repayment status confusing. While FFEL borrowers have the option to consolidate their loans into one Federal Direct Loan (which would be eligible for the payment and interest suspensions), there are significant disadvantages to this approach, such as administrative hurdles and paperwork, long processing times, and potentially higher interest rates. Several states, including New York and Illinois, have announced plans to provide relief for those left out of the CARES Act provisions, and many are calling on Congress to provide all federal loan borrowers with equal support. A bipartisan bill has been introduced to make student loan borrowers with FFEL loans eligible for the benefits under the CARES Act, and the House recently passed the HEROES Act, which would expand student loan relief to include all FFEL and Perkins Loans. The ongoing health crisis does not distinguish between different types of loans, and neither should the government’s response. At the very least, Congress should treat all federal student loans equally in the next COVID relief bill, but it should also consider supporting borrowers in the private loan market. Improving protections for borrowers will better equip them to handle the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression.",

    "content": "Resources Event Slide Deck As Economies Reopen, State Administrators Note a Shift to Family Child Care Key State Quotes The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our nation’s already fragile child care industry. Early on in this crisis, our parent survey found nearly every household had experienced a change in work, 60% of child care programs were temporarily closed, and while the need for child care still exists, parents were concerned about returning to their child care program when they would be able to. Other studies have shown that, due to these compounding factors, many child care programs might not survive the crisis. What’s more, the federal funding provided to states and designed to keep child care providers afloat is beginning to run out. State administrators say without additional funding more providers may be at risk of permanent closure. The federal government, through the CARES Act, allocated $3.5 billion in Child Care and Development Block Grant funds to provide child care to essential workers on the frontlines of the pandemic, and gave states wide flexibility in how they could use such funding. Therefore, states took a variety of approaches when it came to child care during the height of the pandemic. Our survey found that while a quarter of parents were not aware of their state’s plan for child care operations during the pandemic, of those who were aware, the vast majority (82%) were supportive of their state’s decisions. To learn more about how the CARES Act funds were spent by states, and the impacts they are having, BPC talked with 10 state child care administrators: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, and Washington. There was consensus among the administrators that the CARES Act funds made a difference and were needed, but were not enough to sustain the market past the summer and into the fall, just as states start to reopen their economies. It is clear this pandemic is far from over, and therefore, more federal funding and targeted policy approaches to support the sustainability of this critical market are necessary.",

    "content": "COVID-19 began as a public health crisis, but the economic fallout—jobs lost, businesses closed, and families struggling to make ends meet—has proven devastating, too. To help Americans weather the storm, lawmakers enacted an unprecedented expansion of unemployment insurance in the CARES Act. These changes included expanded eligibility to allow more workers to claim UI and a $600 increase in weekly benefits across the board. With the supplemental $600 set to expire at the end of July, lawmakers face a difficult balancing act: how to protect public health and continue providing support to those unable to return to work without inhibiting the economic recovery that is sorely needed. BPC recently invited a group of experts to weigh in on this issue, with some key takeaways worth sharing: The UI expansion was an important part of the federal response to the public health crisis. In the short-term, providing critical financial support has allowed workers to stay home to protect their health and slowed the spread of the virus. State UI systems need updates to ensure people receive their benefits in a timely manner. UI is administered at the state level, and many state systems were unprepared for the large influx of claimants. While the sheer volume of claims over the past two months is entirely unprecedented, outmoded technology along with application systems designed to prevent reliance on UI benefits have contributed to long delays. The fact that some workers are still waiting to receive benefits they initially claimed in March points to the critical need to modernize state UI delivery systems. Many collect more in expanded UI benefits than they made while employed, which has the potential to serve as a work disincentive. Average weekly unemployment benefits vary widely by state, from $213 in Mississippi to $555 in Massachusetts. With the additional $600 weekly benefit, two-thirds of eligible unemployed workers can receive benefits in excess of their lost income, and 20% can collect an amount that at least doubles their previous earnings. As businesses begin to return to some semblance of normal operations over the coming months, enhanced UI benefits may make it a struggle to reassemble the workforce, prolonging the labor market healing process. There is middle ground between extending the $600 benefit indefinitely and letting it expire. The gradual transition from relief to recovery must incorporate public health considerations in order to continue slowing the spread of the virus. But as public health officials provide clearance for business to resume, lawmakers need to ensure the correct incentives are in place to get people back to work and facilitate the economic recovery. Options could include phasing down the enhanced benefit, allowing those who return to work to continue collecting a portion of their benefit, and permitting part-time work without a loss of benefits. The unemployment insurance expansion in the CARES Act was a significant and necessary action to address the immediate challenges brought by the coronavirus. With expiration now on the horizon, lawmakers must chart a path forward that is consistent with protecting public health, supporting&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the health care challenges that have long plagued rural communities, and underscores why recent recommendations from the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Rural Health Task Force are now more important than ever. Today, rural America faces the dual problems of caring for the recent influx of sick patients while figuring out how to cope with massive revenue losses that began early in the pandemic when they had to cancel elective procedures. Even before the pandemic, rural hospitals were struggling. Indeed, 128 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, including 10 so far this year.1 And according to the 2020 rural hospital sustainability index, an additional 354 rural hospitals across 40 states are at risk of closing with 81% of those considered highly essential to the health and economic well-being of their communities.2 For rural hospitals and clinics, COVID-19 is now threatening their very existence. This puts rural Americans at greater risk of losing their only local access to care both during the pandemic and after the virus is gone. The virus, while initially hitting predominately urban areas, is now spreading in rural communities. As of May 19th, four of the 10 worst current confirmed outbreaks in the U.S. are in rural Southern counties.3 The rates of infection are also rising in other rural communities across the country, largely connected to food-processing facilities, farms, and other large-scale industries where people work closely together and do not have the option of teleworking.4 If implemented by Congress, the task force’s recommendations will better equip rural communities to face the challenges of COVID-19 today and build stronger rural health care systems in the future. In 2019, BPC’s task force began its work under the leadership of co-chairs former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle; former Sen. Olympia Snowe; former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove; and former Gov. and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson. The goal was to produce policy recommendations that would improve access to quality, affordable health care in rural communities. The challenges were many and obvious. Rural residents tend to be older and sicker than their urban counterparts; they are more likely to experience potentially preventable death from the five leading causes: heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke.5 Rural communities struggle to recruit and retain health care providers and often lack the broadband needed to make use of telehealth. In a BPC and American Heart Association poll released last year, more than half of rural residents (54%) said access to medical specialists, such as cardiologists or oncologists, is a problem in their local community and that the availability of appointments (56%) and the distance to receive care (50%) are barriers to accessing health care.6 The pandemic has exacerbated each of these challenges. This virus is more dangerous and deadly for those who are older and those who have serious underlying medical conditions including heart conditions and chronic lung disease.7 Treatment for the very ill often requires sophisticated equipment in intensive care units overseen by specially&hellip;",

    "content": "The spread of the novel coronavirus has rapidly upended the American higher education system. Students have vacated their dorms, classes are moving online, and graduation ceremonies have gone virtual. Yet beyond the public health considerations, colleges and universities face myriad challenges that could fundamentally alter the nation’s higher education landscape. As the economic fallout of COVID-19 unfolds, policymakers should carefully consider how federal policy can best address these challenges. COVID-19 has placed enormous pressure on institutions’ balance sheets, which will likely result in school closures and could also have implications for educational quality. Colleges and universities are highly dependent on tuition revenues to fund their operating budgets, but surveys suggest that 1 in 5 would-be college students are unlikely to enroll this fall. These enrollment declines would leave the system with an estimated $23 billion shortfall for the coming academic year, in addition to an estimated 25% reduction in “auxiliary revenues” from facility rentals for conferences, summer camps, and other events. The virus has also upended state budgets, portending cuts in state higher education funding. This is especially troubling given that appropriations still haven’t entirely recovered from the Great Recession, when per-student funding fell by more than 24%. These new declines will be particularly painful for public institutions, which rely heavily on funding from state and local governments. These schools are likely to see enrollment upswings once the virus recedes, but potentially before state budgets recover from the crisis. Around half of high school seniors and current college students report that the virus has impacted their family’s financial situation, which means many students will likely need more aid than originally anticipated. This will put further pressure on institutional resources. There are also administrative challenges to consider. Eligibility for federal student aid is determined through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which primarily relies on information from two-year-old tax returns—information that will now be grossly outdated for millions of students. While the Department of Education allows financial aid administrators to alter a student’s FAFSA through professional judgement, this system lacks a standardized process. Large-scale implementation would pose an administrative burden, not to mention significant action and advocacy on the part of students who must initiate this review themselves. Movement toward remote learning has raised questions about the value of online education. Media outlets have reported on the fundamental challenges facing students, many of whom do not have access to the technology or a high-speed internet connection needed to complete their coursework. But questions of quality go beyond the issue of access. Prior to the pandemic, just over 15% of postsecondary students were enrolled in fully online programs. Research shows that students in online-only education, particularly vulnerable student populations, frequently struggle to complete their program, and on average, experience poor outcomes. Moreover, many online options cost more than traditional colleges and universities, and often do not provide students with a positive return on investment. Faculty have been challenged by this transition as well; only 50% of institutions have faculty&hellip;",

Even as we start to return to a degree of normalcy, health experts warn that some level of social distancing will be required for at least another year. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested that Congress implement a “block” or “staggered” schedule to reduce interaction among members while they attend committee hearings. In a block schedule, committees are distributed among several groups; these groups are then assigned specific durations of time during which they can meet. By staggering committees throughout the day or week, we can reduce the frequency with which members interact. BPC has long been a proponent of block scheduling and previously recommended a specific block schedule that would minimize the number of scheduling conflicts that members face. This research showed that implementing an optimized block schedule, informed by data science, could reduce scheduling conflicts by up to 86 percent. Of course, the concern now is not so much conflict as it is close social interaction between members. Considering this novel dilemma, BPC applied similar optimization logic to approximate a distribution of committees among blocks that would best maintain social distancing. We found that an optimized block schedule could reduce direct interaction between members by 36 percent. While promising, it is important to note that, if taken alone, this measure would not be effective. Rather, only in combination with other strict social distancing precautions, such as wearing personal protective equipment, would an optimized block schedule prove useful. Using a greedy algorithm, we were able to identity a committee distribution that significantly reduces interactions between members of Congress. While we refer to the given assignment of committees as the “optimized solution,” it is important to note that this is only an approximation of the true optimum. However, after testing over 50,000 random block assignments, the distribution of outputs suggests that this is negligibly close to the global optimum. The optimized distribution of committees below would naturally create social distancing with the potential to reduce the risk of direct member-to-member spread of the coronavirus by 36%. 175 If all members were present at the same time without a block schedule in place, there would be a total of 92,235 pairwise interactions.1 Dividing committees into the three blocks produced by the algorithm yielded a total of 58,903 pairwise interactions, a sizable decrease from the original 92,235. An optimized schedule might be interesting on its own, but it is useless without proper implementation. To maximize the effectiveness of a block schedule, the House of Representatives should also do the following: Stagger scheduling blocks throughout the week, with each block meeting on a specific day. This would not only minimize the chances that members in different blocks interact unnecessarily, but it also allows time for committee rooms to be disinfected each day, thereby reducing the risk of&hellip;",

Author’s note: The prior version of this blog post miscalculated the number of returns under the Guatemalan Asylum Cooperation Agreement; these numbers have been revised. This update also contains updated data about the Migration Protection Protocols program from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse and Southwest border apprehensions from CBP. Finally, this update includes new data on the Trump administration’s border policies that DHS published in October 2020; this data appears in footnote 3. In March 2020, the Trump administration issued an order through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection to expel any migrant to the last country of transit or origin. In contrast to the previous border policies, which derived their authorities from the Immigration and Nationality Act, the CDC issued the March order through Title 42 of the Public Health Safety Act that allows the temporary suspension of entry of certain persons into the United States “when doing so is required in the interest of the public health.” Since then, “expulsions” under this order have become the most common means of returning migrants arriving from Mexico, overtaking both the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, and removals under the Guatemalan Asylum Cooperation Agreement, or ACA. However, the administration’s decision to indefinitely extend the order in mid-May raises questions about its long-term viability, especially since it relies on the acquiescence of other countries to implement the measure. A review of the number of migrants processed through the different border programs currently in effect shows that the administration has shifted its processing of migrant arrivals towards Title 42 expulsions.1 As Figure 1 shows, MPP served as the Trump administration’s primary vehicle to process migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2019, hitting a peak of 12,403 individuals in August 2019. In late 2019, federal authorities started returning migrants under the Guatemalan ACA, causing MPP returns to drop to 1,701 in February 2020 while ACA returns grew to 939 by March 2020.2 After Guatemala suspended ACA returns in March 2020 to limit the spread of COVID-19 from the United States, the federal government began using Title 42 expulsions as a substitute process in mid-March. In April 2020, the government expelled 14,416 migrants from the U.S.-Mexico border under Title 42, a number that exceeded the combined number of MPP and ACA returns in each of the preceding three months.3 Sources: DHS, TRAC, CBS/Al Jazeera** *As of this publication date, TRAC has not released April 2020 MPP case numbers Therefore, Figures 1 to 3 exclude MPP data for April 2020. ** The ACA data comes from two journalists who have been tracking Guatemalan ACA returns on Twitter since the program’s implementation: CBS’ Camilo Montoya-Galvez and Al Jazeera’s Jeff Abbott.

Yet, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the world we knew two months ago has drastically changed, upending our daily routines and what we had once known as “normal.” This blog series is an effort to support parents of young children, many of whom are asking for guidance on how to best nurture, educate, and support their children during this time.  As states move to reopen their economies, access to safe and healthy child care programs is a necessity for working parents. During COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, young children have likely experienced significant changes in their expected routines and relationships if their typical child care program temporarily closed or only served essential workers’ families. Parents working from home during COVID-19 are juggling multiple responsibilities, and often lack the support to singly focus on caregiving. BPC is offering parents resources to support positive family mental health and at-home learning opportunities for families under stay-at-home orders. Returning to child care is another significant change for children in an already disruptive social environment, so it is critical that child care programs and parents are supportive partners in a child’s return to congregate care settings. The following guidance is intended to help parents transition their children back into a child care routine as states begin to open and parents return to work. As states begin to reopen, child care programs may be reaching out to parents about their expectations for returning to child care. Parents should be encouraged to share their child care needs in addition to their child’s experience at home during COVID-19. This information is critical to support child care classrooms in the coming months as children may exhibit signs of stress or separation anxiety. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for child care include stationing drop-off and pick-up outside of child care programs, adults wearing masks throughout the day, and limited interaction between classrooms. As states rely on these guidelines or implement their own child care guidance, child care may look and feel different for children. Parents can establish what child care will be like for children when return. Walk children through new child care entry protocol, including temperature and symptom checks. Normalize wearing a mask for older children, and ensure younger children are used to seeing trusted adults with face coverings by practicing at home. Practice handwashing frequently, including before and after meals. Parents should feel able to speak directly with program administrators and child care teachers to establish or reestablish trust as they transition their child back into child care settings. In a BPC survey of working parents with young children, parents frequently cited trust as a central issue in their child care choice. To build and sustain trust between parents and child care programs during a time of uncertainty, clear and frequent communication in preferred channels is an absolute. This is especially important for young children who may have spent several months at&hellip;",

Buckley Jr.’s debut 1951 book, God and Man at Yale, a jeremiad against what he perceived to be the anti-religious and anti-capitalist dogma of Yale. Thus, to point out that colleges have always been predominantly liberal is not exactly a man-bites-dog news flash. However, the disruption of higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic will surely shake up the institution, and, as campuses adapt to new realities, there may be opportunities to address the lack of ideological diversity—we should hope that as colleges adapt, they keep this issue in view. In aiming for greater ideological balance, one might concede that perhaps colleges should be left-leaning, even radical, to some extent. The traditional conservative view that colleges and universities should be the repositories and intergenerational transmission belts for our civilization is only partly true or meritorious. The medieval university can be said to have originated in the need for an intellectual institution that could work out serious difficulties in our guiding ideas—think of Thomas Aquinas synthesizing pagan Aristotelianism with post-Roman Christianity at the University of Paris. To the extent that constant reform is a central part of human progress, universities are the indispensable institutions for challenging the status quo, even if, as at Thomas Edison’s Menlo Park laboratory, many of the ideas generated in universities don’t work. Universities are supposed to be the congenial home of the nonconformist, the free-thinker, the innovator. There are reasons to wonder whether at some point the increasing ideological conformity on campuses has the paradoxical effect of making our colleges less dynamically radical; in fact, it may make them downright reactionary in the plain sense of that term. The data showing a decline in the ideological diversity of university faculties over the last 25 years ought to worry us because of an underappreciated tendency of “groupthink” to make “in-groups” more extreme. This is the thesis raised in Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein’s recent book Conformity: The Power of Social Influences, which explores how the phenomenon of “social cascades” among self-isolated, like-minded groups leads to increased polarization, the hardening of extreme viewpoints, and the degradation of deliberation. The book collects and builds on several previous articles on this subject. In his book, Sunstein does not apply his thesis to college campuses&hellip;",

    "content": "The Spring 2020 semester will forever be known as the “pandemic semester.” It’s striking to recall that the first half of the term was entirely ordinary, with Spring Break on the horizon and students firming up summer jobs, internships, and travel. Just before the world was upended, BPC brought together 30 college leaders from two dozen schools to discuss the crisis of free expression and share strategies to address it. Schools represented included public and private universities, as well as religiously affiliated and Hispanic-serving schools. Leaders discussed the depth of the free expression challenge on campus, and considered data that suggest many students favor speech codes, safe spaces, and limits on expression that may offend others. Many reported that they routinely hear from their students that free expression is incompatible with a safe and diverse campus. They are actively seeking ways to assure students that campus can be safe, diverse, and inclusive while being open to wide-ranging exchange and free speech. Leaders also expressed the view that while incendiary speakers and hate-speech incidents are real problems, the deepest issues are ensuring frank, open, and respectful exchange in classrooms, dorms, and the quad as part of students’ daily experience of collegiate life. Leaders also shared a range of strategies and lessons-learned in developing and implementing policies, programs, and curricula that addressed various aspects of free expression. Befitting a conversation about open exchange, not everyone agreed on every point. But here are strategies that were shared and discussed over the course of the day: As campus free expression issues have become more fraught on campuses, it is not enough to have a set of policies developed in different campus offices, or even an overall statement on free expression. Instead, schools should develop a strategy that articulates how free expression will be woven into all aspects of campus life. The strategy needs input from the provost and deans, general counsel, faculty senators, student affairs, campus police, communications, staff, and student leaders. A campus-wide strategy not only encourages proactive programming and consistency, but also enables leadership to respond to controversies—such as a speaker bent on provocation without contributing to academic discourse—in ways that ensure student safety while upholding free speech values and the school’s mission. Leaders noted that there is no such thing as an off-the-shelf strategy and described approaches grounded in campus history and traditions, as well as, for denominational colleges, their religious creed. Freshmen orientation is a unique opportunity to develop shared expectations about the importance of open exchange and free expression to the truly transformative college experience students desire. Schools, such as Washington University in St. Louis, are building conversational skill development into freshmen orientation. This includes explaining why academic discussions require a multiplicity of viewpoints; that listening to someone with whom you disagree does not mean endorsing his or her ideas; and that having views challenged is to be welcomed. First Amendment Watch, a project of NYU’s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, and Georgetown University’s Free Speech Project have created&hellip;",

    "content": "In recent weeks, nearly every state in the country has begun the process of lifting stay-at-home orders and loosening public health restrictions on business and leisure, allowing some workers to return to their jobs and consumers to resume some economic activity. Reopening the economy is a necessity full of promise and peril. By and large, Americans understand the health imperative behind restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. At the same time, they are deeply concerned about their wellbeing and financial future in a hindered economy with historically high unemployment. It has long been known that economic deprivation poses profound risks to individual and community health. As federal, state, and local officials continue the process of reopening, they must carefully navigate the dual public health imperatives of overcoming COVID-19 and supporting economic recovery. With coordinated leadership anchored in public health evidence, our country&#8217;s leaders can provide confidence for renewed economic activity. By enabling a strong economic recovery, they can ensure that American workers have the resources and resilience needed to provide for their families despite the difficult times ahead for us all. In seeking to support and sustain economic recovery, Americans and their elected leaders face a number of critical challenges. The Bipartisan Policy Center is committed to exploring these challenges and putting forth actionable solutions. In our new initiative, Reopening America: Protecting Public Health and Rebuilding Economic Strength, BPC will marshal in-house experts, veteran subject matter authorities, and public opinion surveys to chart a course forward which speaks to the realities of working Americans of all political persuasions, geographies, and ages. The series will begin with two events, both this week: Wednesday, May 20, at 11 a.m. ET: Is There a Bipartisan Solution for Liability Concerns? will be a web event exploring the challenges businesses face in reopening and the merit of proposals for federal policy changes intended to protect companies from some COVID-19-related lawsuits. Thursday, May 21, at 11 a.m. ET: The $600 (Unemployment Insurance) Question will be a web event exploring the impact of recent expansions to the unemployment insurance system and proposals to enable a safe return to work. Below are the five key challenges which will be the focus of the series. While the level of COVID-19 testing has improved in recent weeks, testing capacity remains the largest challenge to ensuring public health, and in turn economic recovery, in the United States. As BPC emphasized in an April report on lessons learned from other countries, “loosening social distancing interventions is incumbent upon increased testing.” Among public health experts, there is general consensus that continued economic reopening will require a more robust COVID-19 testing infrastructure which can promptly identify and isolate cases. It will also require a public health system that is well-funded, well-supported, and able to lead contact tracing efforts, and a health care system with sufficient capacity and available personal protective equipment and critical medical supplies. To determine when to loosen restrictions on economic and social activity, BPC has recommended that&hellip;",

    "content": "COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on our nation and the economic security of America’s working families. Through this crisis, we are left with a number of unknowns: What is the safest timeline for reopening child care? What child care choices will parents make post-COVID-19? What safeguards should be put in place to protect the nation’s children, families, and child care workers? This blog post attempts to address the many unknowns and to better understand how COVID-19 will impact the future of children and working families. Among the 36.5 million people who have filed for unemployment in the last eight weeks are many working parents now looking for new jobs, while many other parents are working remotely without the support of child care. Meanwhile, millions of essential workers who are needed to keep this nation moving forward—including health care professionals, grocery store employees, banking professionals, and child care providers—are serving on the frontlines and forced to put their health at risk. At present, social distancing measures have created a new normal for working families across the country. In a survey of working parents with young children conducted by BPC and Morning Consult, 86% of households experienced a change in their work situation, including a reduction in hours or required telework. The same survey found that despite the closure of nearly two-thirds of the nation’s child care programs, almost half of respondents have been able to care for their children in their home during this crisis. It remains uncertain how long this pandemic will last, and while some states have already begun to relax social isolation measures, researchers at Harvard University recently found that some social distancing measures may need to continue through 2020. As we begin to prepare for recovery and the child care landscape post-COVID-19, we must ask what will the demand for child care be in our nation’s post-COVID recovery period. The child care industry cannot assume the demand for child care will remain the same once social isolation guidance is lifted. First, the Congressional Budget Office has projected unemployment rates to average 15% in the second and third quarters of 2020. CBO’s average projected unemployment rates for 2020 and 2021 are 11.4% and 10.1%, respectively, a dramatic increase from 3.7% in 2019. The expectation that fewer households will be in the workforce may reduce the demand for child care for the nation’s families. It also may mean an increase in the number of adults willing to provide family child care in their homes. National surveys and parent focus groups conducted over the last six months show that trust is the first and most important thing parents look for in selecting child care. Yet, this trust is difficult to build—and will be difficult to rebuild post-pandemic—when child care providers are working within a broken industry. The national median hourly wage for child care workers in 2019 was $11.72, and across the country, more than half were part of at least one public support program. Along with low wages,&hellip;",

    "content": "A newly released survey1 conducted by Morning Consult for the Bipartisan Policy Center found that voters do not believe that the federal government should prioritize using immigration policies to address the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a majority of voters did approve of President Donald Trump’s temporary suspension of overseas green card processing, they were evenly split on whether that policy would be effective in helping the economic recovery, reflecting Americans’ conflicting views about the role of immigration in today’s economy. Thirty-six percent of respondents believe the federal government should prioritize developing treatment and vaccines for COVID-19 above other priorities. However, immigration options remained a low priority for voters: 66% said shutting down immigration should be the fifth or sixth priority of the six we tested and 70% said allowing migrant workers to enter the United States to support the food supply should be the fifth or sixth priority of the six. Source: Morning Consult Despite perceiving immigration as a low priority for the government during the pandemic, respondents generally approved of Trump’s suspension of green cards for non-citizens seeking to immigrate to the United States from overseas. Fifty-eight percent of respondents somewhat or strongly approved of the new executive order with only 31% somewhat or strongly disapproving of it. Although the poll found that those who strongly approved varied across demographic groups, only 28% of unemployed respondents strongly approved of the measure, the lowest percentage among all employment categories.2 Meanwhile, 43% of retired respondents and 42% of homemakers strongly approved it, the two highest percentages for this option of the employment groups surveyed. Source: Morning Consult The complete prompt was “As you may know, President Trump recently signed an executive order temporarily suspending the issuance of new green cards for most people outside the United States for 60 days. Based on what you know, do you approve or disapprove of President Trump’s decision to temporarily suspend the issuance of new green cards for 60 days?” However, respondents were split on whether Trump’s policy will open more jobs for American workers during the pandemic. Twenty-two percent said that the policy would be “very effective,” the same percentage as those who said it would “not be at all effective.” In the middle, 25% said it would be “somewhat effective,” 19% said it would be “not too effective” and 13% were unsure or didn’t know. Only 17% of unemployed individuals said that the policy would be very effective while 29% of self-employed respondents and 24% of retired persons said the same, showing continued divisions by employment status over the employment impact of immigrants. Source: Morning Consult The complete prompt was “Based on what you know, how effective, if at all, do you think President Trump’s decision to temporarily suspend the issuance of new green cards will be in opening more jobs for American workers during COVID-19?” Morning Consult asked this question after the one that appeared in Figure 2.

    "content": "The Bipartisan Policy Center recognizes the importance of child care and early learning in the lives of children and families. Yet, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the world we knew two months ago has drastically changed, upending our daily routines and what we had once known as “normal.” This  blog series is an effort to support parents of young children, many of whom are asking for guidance on how to best nurture, educate, and support their children during this time.  The COVID-19 pandemic has created many sources of stress and anxiety for parents of young children across the country. Concerns about health, combined with uncertainty over unemployment and finances, work, child care, and access to food and other resources are all contributing to increasing stress among American adults. According to an April 2020 poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 45% of U.S. adults say that their mental health has been negatively affected by stress over the virus and its effects, an increase from 32% in March 2020. Further intensifying the impact of these stressors is a lack of connection due to social distancing and shelter-in-place orders that can leave many feeling isolated. Uncertainties over child care are also contributing to stress for many parents. BPC’s April 2020 survey with Morning Consult found that as the child care landscape changes due to COVID-19, parents’ caregiving activities are changing dramatically. Sixty percent of all child care programs are fully closed and not providing any care. One third of parents working remotely report alternating work hours with someone else in their household in order to care for their children, and nearly 30% of parents are either working outside normal business hours or taking paid or unpaid leave to care for their children. The interactions and experiences children have during their first several years of life greatly impact their development, and with both children and parents spending more time together in the home, there are new opportunities for learning. However, during this current crisis, stress and anxiety can be exacerbated. Just as positive behaviors can promote healthy outcomes for children, parental stress can negatively impact children’s behavior and development. This pandemic is a stressful time for many. To support parents of young children, BPC has provided a list of guidance to help parents better manage stress and promote their own well-being throughout the pandemic. Using these tools can also be helpful in teaching children how to cope with stressful and uncertain situations. Establish a daily routine: The disruption of routine and structure can be stressful for both adults and children. To maintain balance and a sense of normalcy, structure each day with activities for learning and play, and stick to regular sleeping and eating schedules. Routine actions, such as making the bed, showering, getting dressed, and eating nutritious meals can help people feel in control through this pandemic. Cultivate good physical health: Evidence shows that physical activity can reduce depressive systems and can help regulate one’s mood. Exercising regularly can improve physical and mental health, and also support&hellip;",

Students, Instructors Face Threats and Hateful Speech as Zoom Meetings Get “Bombed” Jake Goldstein-Street and Claudia Yaw | The Daily | April 1, 2020 On April 1 at the University of Washington, “an individual in a password-protected Zoom conference for a biostatistics seminar class used the annotation tool to post the n-word repeatedly across the screen, visible to everyone in the class. Over chat, they called students racist slurs, specifically targeting Asian students with xenophobic remarks about the coronavirus and threatened to ‘shoot up’ one student’s house.” Working with students, the teacher was able to remove the perpetrator but ended class early. The university, located only a few miles from one of the first U.S. COVID-19 outbreaks, is among the first to experience remote classes being “bombarded with hateful language targeting black students, Jewish students, women, and the LGBTQIA+ community, making it harder for instructors and students to shift to fully online classes during the novel coronavirus pandemic.” College Probes Controversial “MenofDickinson” Instagram Account Sarah Manderbach | The Dickinsonian | April 19, 2020 A social media account called “MenofDickinson” stirred controversy at Dickinson College with posts that are derogatory towards women. Students traced the IP address and phone number of the account to a Dickinson student, who denies creating and operating the account. After complaints from students and alumni, administrators directed campus police to identify the account’s owner and contacted the social media platform to request that it close the account, which has since been deactivated. UNT Professor Fired Over Microaggressions Dispute Sues University Marshall Reid | Denton Record-Chronicle | April 22, 2020 Former University of North Texas adjunct professor of mathematics Nathaniel Hiers is suing the school for wrongful termination and breach of his constitutional rights. “According to the lawsuit, Hiers’ contract was rescinded after he criticized flyers decrying microaggressions, left by an unknown person in a faculty break room. …Hiers said he wrote, ‘Please don’t leave garbage lying around,’ on a nearby chalkboard with an arrow pointing to the flyers.” His attorney “wrote that Hiers ‘firmly rejects bias and prejudice against any person or group of people, including marginalized groups’; however, he thinks the concept of microaggressions harms diversity and tolerance by promoting a culture of victimhood.” “They Are Against Free Speech”: Baylor, TCU Refuse to Recognize Turning Point USA Chapters Mary Margaret Olohan | Daily Caller | April 22, 2020 Administrators at Baylor University and Texas Christian University have declined to recognize chapters of Turning Point USA, despite efforts on the part of the schools’ students to form branches of the organization.

    "content": "During this global health and economic crisis, American consumers have changed their spending habits. They’re spending more on everyday essentials and adopting new brands and behaviors. These habits are likely to continue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether consumers are aware of it or not, the emotional dimension of consumption has intensified during the crisis. And this heightened state of insecurity provides companies with a real opportunity to build deeper and trustworthy relationships with customers as noted in a recent interview by CO—an editorial website by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce— with consumer psychologist Yit Karow. A core element of this opportunity includes how companies treat their own employees. While “conscious or sustainable capitalism” has gained mainstream traction for some time, the crisis seems to have accelerated consumer interest in companies that invest in their employees or address income and gender inequity for example. A recent survey conducted by Morning Consult, found that 67 percent of Americans say they want companies that they purchase goods and services from to take care of their employees and treat them well. Moreover, a strong plurality of consumers say they are more likely to purchase products or services from companies that provide their employees paid sick leave (65 percent) and promise to rehire employees who were laid off (64 percent). Companies who can afford to, should consider providing paid sick leave to increase consumer spending, which is vital to the economy. But it also helps workers stay home; reduces the economic burden associated with staying home for women and minorities; and helps control the spread of virus. In a 2017 study, paid sick leave was found to significantly lower overall worker absenteeism, potentially saving employers $630 million to $1.88 billion per year. Paid sick leave is also associated with higher likelihoods of seeking preventative care. Prior to the pandemic, nearly a quarter of all American workers lacked access to paid sick leave. Congress tried narrowing this gap with the passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which reimburses small and midsize companies with dollar-for-dollar tax credits for the cost of providing 10 days (80 hours) of paid sick leave wages to their employees during COVID-19. This was a significant step to slow the spread of the virus and support small business owners reeling from the rapid fall of consumer demand, but it excluded employers with 500 or more workers. And while 91 percent of workers at companies with more than 500 workers had access to paid sick leave prior to the current crisis, the average length was only eight days, which is six days short of the recommended 14-day quarantine for coronavirus. As Congress considers a fourth stimulus package, policymakers should continue to work with the administration in a bipartisan fashion to require companies of all sizes to extend paid sick leave. In doing so, Congress should also pick up the tab. Otherwise, we risk hurting businesses already operating at razor thin margins. And if the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that consumer behavior has&hellip;",

BPC’s recent survey with Morning Consult found that only 14% of households had not experienced any change in work situation. Some parents have moved to remote work, while others are experiencing changes in hours, employer closures, and layoffs. A majority (60%) of parents also report that their child care provider has closed. Children have been taken out of their daily routine and are missing their regular interactions with providers, teachers, and other children. Many parents have taken over their child’s care full time, often while juggling work and care for other family members. Even under the best circumstances, parents do not always feel confident about their ability to play or struggle with busy schedules. Between managing their own stress, workplace demands, and children’s needs and behaviors, parents may not feel prepared to create activities that occupy their children throughout the day and promote development while also managing these other responsibilities. Research in child development over the last several decades has found that children are learning from birth. Parents play a key role in supporting this development, as young children learn through play and exploration with the support of caring adults. As many parents adjust to increased caregiving time and try to navigate the variety of resources and activities available, there are some guiding principles to keep in mind. There are many resources for parents during this time, but it is important to not feel overwhelmed. Below is a compiled a list of resources, videos, and activities for young children. If you are looking for specific activities: Jumpstart: Bilingual (English/Spanish) storybook read-alouds and activity guides. PBS Kids: A tool that suggests activities and resources based on a child’s age and selected topic. Choices include topics like literacy, math, and science as well as emotions, self-awareness, and social skills.

Don Bacon (R-NE-2) and Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) met “virtually” on a video call along with school superintendents and food bank representatives from their respective Nebraska and California districts. The discussion centered on the challenges of providing food for families in need along with safeguarding the nutritional health of vulnerable children. As summer approaches, more and more families may be left without access to healthy meals. The conversation was part of BPC’s American Congressional Exchange program, which brings together representatives from different parties in different parts of the country to better understand the challenges they each face, and to discuss ways they can work together. Over the past two years, more than two dozen lawmakers have visited each other’s Districts through the program. Reps. Bacon and Carbajal already completed trips to one another’s districts in 2018. “BPC has helped build our relationship,” said Bacon. “Salud and I have traveled the world together to help solve issues we both feel strongly about.” Carbajal added, “Thanks to BPC, we have the opportunity to meet and discuss what really matters. This program has brought Don and me even closer together and provided us the opportunity to build relationships between our constituents.” Both members’ districts play an important role in the nation’s food supply and agricultural industry. The superintendents who joined the call said the COVID-19 crisis has magnified their schools’ role as a community service resource. The schools are not only supplying children with an education, but are also a significant source for providing meals, especially for low-income students. Dr. Susan Salcido, the Santa Barbara County Superintendent of Schools, says there’s much higher demand for food in her community amidst the coronavirus crisis. She said, “Santa Barbara county is supplying over 38,000 meals every day. The only way we can continue to provide this amount of food is with both federal funding and flexibility from SNAP.” The virtual discussion also included the heads of food banks in California and Nebraska. As more Americans have come to rely on food banks during the pandemic, they talked about the challenges facing food aid programs. Those hurdles include the need for more funding for the staffing of school food services and food banks for the summer. The staffing for distributing the food itself has proved just as difficult as obtaining enough food. “One of the things we need to happen is flexibility from SNAP to feed anyone who is hungry, when they’re hungry&#8230;There is a strong disconnect between where the food is coming from, and how to get it to hungry people,” said Greg Fripp, President and Founder of Omaha-based Whispering Roots. Brian Barks, the President/CEO of Omaha’s Food Bank of the Heartland said food banks are not getting as much surplus food from the food industry because those same surpluses are drying up.&hellip;",

    "content": "Job Title: Executive Vice President Current Employer: Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness Despite the current COVID-19 crisis, it is important for regulatory agencies to continue addressing issues harmful to the economy, such as proxy advisory firm and shareholder proposal reforms. These reforms lack of oversight and their modernized rules have created disincentives for businesses to go public. In turn, this has harmed U.S. competitiveness in a global economy. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been considering these issues and soliciting input for the past 10 years, dating back to its concept release on the U.S. proxy system in 2010. The SEC held a roundtable in 2013 on proxy issues, which led to them issuing guidance in 2014 clarifying responsibilities of investment advisers that rely on proxy advisory firms. Since then, Congress stepped in and actively considered reforms and changes to the proxy system by holding numerous corporate governance hearings in both the House and the Senate, where I had the honor of testifying. Congress also introduced and advanced bipartisan legislation bringing proxy advisory firms under greater regulatory oversight. Ultimately, over the past two years the SEC again started a public comment process on these issues by holding a proxy roundtable in November 2018, which I participated in with other stakeholders in Finally, the SEC issued a proposed rule on proxy advisory firm and shareholder proposal reform in November 2019, and the U.S. Chamber (Proxy Advisory Firm Reform and Shareholder Proposal Reform) and others submitted extensive comments on both proposals. The 2019 proxy advisory firm reform proposal laid out a very well-thought out process that would help reduce errors and mistakes in proxy advisory firm reports, increase transparency in methodologies and sources of information to produce vote recommendations, and would impose liability on proxy advisory firms for making false and misleading statements. Additionally, the proposal contemplated a number of other reasonable alternatives and other areas of interest, which Commissioner Roisman indicated they are looking into. Throughout this process and over a long period of time, the SEC has demonstrated a thoughtful and extensive approach to consider proxy and shareholder reform issues, which has led to the SEC November 2019 proposal that would ensure long-term value for main street investors is considered. It is time for the SEC to move forward on this rulemaking and help companies and investors look towards the future.",

And be sure to tune in to our podcast, This Week in Immigration, for even more in-depth analysis of immigration news from the last two weeks. President Trump has repeatedly touted the travel restrictions from the People’s Republic of China announced in late January as critical to slowing the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. However, new reporting suggests that the restrictions had less of an impact than Trump has indicated. A recent report by the Cato Institute examined how the White House proclamation on travel of Chinese citizens affected the spread of the novel coronavirus in the United States. The paper modeled the impact of the travel stoppage against what the spread might have looked like without the restrictions, in different scenarios. The authors found that based on their model, “the empirical evidence is that the U.S.-imposed travel ban on the PRC had no statistically significant effect on the timing, number, or rate of COVID-19 cases in the United States.” At most, the authors allow, the travel restrictions may have delayed the spread of the disease in the United States for 15 days. To add to this debate, the New York Times reported that travel restrictions from China and Europe still allowed many American citizens to return home, blunting any potential effect they might have had in containing the virus. The Times article cites a report from the Department of Homeland Security sent to the House Oversight and Reform Committee which reports at most one in 10 returning citizens in a 10-week period between January and March were checked to see if they had a temperature, and only 1,500 of approximately 250,000 travelers were referred to CDC officers for secondary screening at airports. Unlike Canada, which imposed a 14-day mandatory self-quarantine on its returning citizens when it issued a similar travel ban—with a $750,000 fine for non-compliance—the United States did not mandate any restrictions on returning citizens who were not ordered to quarantine by CDC screening. So, does this mean that travel controls are not useful in controlling a pandemic? Well, many experts believe that if done early enough, travel restrictions could slow the arrival of the virus giving the country time to prepare and amass necessary health resources. But in today’s interconnected world is unlikely to prevent its introduction. Nevertheless, travel restrictions can be a mitigation strategy in the pandemic toolbox, but we should be very cautious about making broad proclamations about its effectiveness, especially without more robust border controls. For more on how we could incorporate better health intelligence and a proactive approach to screening for health threats, see Cristobal Ramón’s piece for BPC here. On April 30, an unlikely bipartisan group led by Senators David Purdue (R-GA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Todd Young (R-IN), Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced S. 3599, the “Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act.” The bill would allow&hellip;",

The NAM is the largest manufacturing trade association in the United States, representing small and large manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states. In his role at the NAM, Charles leads the organization’s policy and advocacy work on corporate governance and financial services issues; particular areas of focus include the proxy process, shareholder engagement, capital formation, and public company reporting. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been wrestling with how to bring transparency and accountability to the proxy advisory firm industry—and in so doing protect investors and companies alike from their outsized influence—for more than a decade. Now that the SEC is on the cusp of finalizing the groundbreaking rule it proposed last November, three major themes have emerged: Proxy firms should be required to disclose information about their substantial conflicts of interest and unregulated methodologies so the market can fairly judge their advice. Companies should have an opportunity to review proxy firm reports and provide feedback to correct errors, highlight methodological weaknesses, and notify investors of significant disagreements that could impact voting decisions. Consistent with their fiduciary duty to investors, asset managers should make proactive, informed proxy voting decisions based on the data available to them. The SEC’s proposed rule provides for robust disclosure of proxy firm conflicts of interest and methodologies—vital information for investors and issuers to understand the firms’ recommendations. These disclosures are an important cornerstone of the proposed rule, and there have not been any indications that the Commission is re-thinking these requirements. Reports have surfaced, however, that the SEC is considering how its proposed mechanism for issuer review and feedback will work once the proxy firm rule is finalized. According to a speech given by SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman in early March, the timing of issuer review may change in response to feedback received during the SEC’s notice-and-comment process. While the review timeline laid out in the proposed rule was designed to alleviate timing pressures during the busy proxy season (and even included specific incentives for companies to file their proxy statements as early as possible), the timing of the process matters far less than its substance. All market actors (proxy firms, issuers, asset managers, and investors) will benefit from companies having the opportunity to both review proxy firm reports and communicate any concerns to investors. Under the proposed rule, this review would take place prior to the proxy firm report being published; any company feedback would be distributed to investors via hyperlink along with the proxy firm’s recommendations. If the commission moves to contemporaneous review instead (in other words, if investors and issuers receive the proxy firm report at the same time and review it concurrently), the SEC must allow for (A.) a process by which a company’s response statement can be distributed to investors before votes are cast&hellip;",

    "content": "While much of the country has already figured out how to conduct business remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress is moving slowly and erratically to implement plans for how it will operate. Fortunately, that hasn’t stopped former members of Congress and other experts from trying to help the legislative branch figure things out. With the help of their experience, we have identified several recommendations for Congress to consider as it grapples with the challenge. On Thursday, April 16th, more than 60 former members of Congress participated in POPVOX’s second mock remote congressional hearing. Co-hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center, it was both a model and a fact-finding exercise.1 The virtual hearing modeled what a real congressional hearing might look like in this format, and the topic it explored was focused on how to put into practice remote operations in the current Congress. BPC previously released six recommendations for Congress based on the first mock hearing. Former members were joined by retired Army General David Petraeus and representatives from Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain. These witnesses testified to their experiences as government officials conducting business remotely, videoconferencing software, and the options that are available to Congress right now. Without some form of remote deliberation in place, Congress won’t be able to operate as the fully functional legislative branch this country needs in a crisis. Mock remote hearings like these help to show Congress ways that it can be sometimes muted, but never silenced, during this pandemic. Here are the next five recommendations Congress will need to keep in mind if they move towards remote operations: In the words of retired General Petraeus, “Like the military, members of Congress have to show up for duty.” Now more than ever, a functional Congress is essential, and Congress must consider remote ways to continue operating during a global pandemic. Fortunately, this mock hearing demonstrated that Congress can feasibly get to work remotely. 1 In addition to BPC, the event was co-organized by the following individuals and organizations: Beth Simone Noveck, Professor, New York University and Director, The Governance Lab Brian Baird, Continuity Program Lead, Democracy Fund Voice Daniel Schuman, Policy Director, Demand Progress Lorelei Kelly, Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation, Georgetown University Marci Harris, CEO and Cofounder, POPVOX",

    "content": "Last week, the Bipartisan Policy Center proudly hosted the third in our series of events, Saving Small Business. With an outstanding group of panelists, this discussion focused on the topic of “Supporting Business Owners of Color and Their Communities.” Below is a full recording of the event as well as annotations regarding specific clips for each speaker and different issues. The robust discussion covered a range of topics, starting with a reminder about the uneven small business landscape that existed well before the COVID-19 crisis. Business owners of color not only had lower sales and business growth but also narrower access to the financial system. Rodney Foxworth, CEO of Common Future, pointed out that, going into this crisis, many Black and Latino communities still hadn’t fully recovered from the 2008-09 financial crisis and recession. Click here for the clip. Here are four summary takeaways from the event. Much of the political attention and fiscal firepower in the crisis response has focused, rightly, on the dire financial situation of many small businesses. Significantly high percentages of small businesses lack the cash reserves to get them through a prolonged period of difficulty. In the information she presented, Nancy Santiago Negron, Community Impact Lead at Ureeka and vice president of Hispanics in Philanthropy, noted that Black and Latino-owned businesses are far more likely to have smaller cash buffers. With so many businesses running out of money, federal policy has focused on getting cash into the hands of business owners. According to survey data from MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that’s exactly what small businesses say they need the most. While agreeing that money is the biggest requirement right now, our panelists pointed out that more is needed to help small businesses. As Santiago Negron pointed out, “Financial capital decoupled from strategic support, coaching, and mentoring is only going to delay the inevitable, it’s not going to change outcomes.” James Ballentine, executive vice president of Congressional relations and political affairs at the American Bankers Association, raised concerns about the additional debt—through expanded loans and loan guarantees—that many small businesses are taking on. This could have negative long-term effects. As Ballentine noted, “I am very concerned about businesses being strapped with too much debt—it is not going to help them. It will help them short-term; it will not help them long-term.” Click here for the clip. The money that has been authorized by Congress to help small businesses—through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster Loans, and more—has been structured as loans through financial institutions. Mostly ignored in the response, however, have been entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs). As Foxworth pointed out, these are usually the “first line of defense” for entrepreneurs and communities, the first place they turn to for information and guidance. They represent a “relational infrastructure” that can help drive resources and capital to diverse groups of business owners. These ESOs are critical because of their credibility and trust. Yet, as Santiago Negron observed, many are nonprofits and may not&hellip;",

    "content": "Deciding which college to attend is a momentous decision, but now students and parents are making that decision absent the traditional campus visit. Normally, a visit is when parents get up close to ensure a school will care not just for their child’s academic future but personal wellbeing. It’s a heavy financial investment, and with some colleges contemplating remote instruction into the fall, not only this year’s high school seniors but next year’s may be forced to sign on the dotted line blindly. Many parents, restricted to online research, are worried whether a college will be a good fit for their child—and whether the school culture welcomes all viewpoints, including the values parents have instilled in them. Good news: there are ways to investigate whether a college has a robust free expression culture without a campus visit. With hundreds of colleges extending the deadline for enrollment commitment into the summer, there’s time to gather information. A first step is to check out what a school’s leaders have said about freedom of expression. More than 70 schools have followed the lead of the University of Chicago in adopting a free expression statement. Other schools haven’t adopted a formal statement but have described a commitment to free expression in pronouncements by the provost, president, or a dean. Next, read up on a school’s polices on protests, tabling, posters, chalking, and leafleting. Of course, most campus speech isn’t made in protest—but how a school handles protest and expressive activities such as tabling is revealing. Schools are right to place some limits on the time, manner, and place of such expression (protestors cannot barge into a classroom or rally at 3:00 am). But when schools go further, limiting protests to a small free speech zone, requiring that all posters be approved before displaying, or restricting leafleting (in a few cases, students have been punished for passing out copies of the U.S. Constitution!), that may be a clue the campus does not embrace open debates. One topic to consider: whether a campus has an “all-comers” policy for clubs and student organizations, which prohibits organizations from excluding anyone from membership or positions of leadership. Some families will see all-comers policies as promoting a non-discriminatory, equitable campus. Other families welcome the idea that a club can limit membership so that, while a student is exposed to the rough-and-tumble of engaging with all viewpoints on the quad and in the classroom, there are communities such as all-women clubs and religious groups exclusive to a particular faith community where they can feel at home intellectually or spiritually. The next step is to learn more about the student civic culture and viewpoint diversity on campus. A university might claim to affirm free expression but still lack a vibrant campus where students can hear a range of viewpoints and share their opinions freely. One important clue is found in the range of its registered student organizations (RSOs), listed on a school’s website. Are there both Democratic and Republican student groups? ROTC&hellip;",

And be sure to tune in to our podcast, This Week in Immigration, for even more in-depth analysis of immigration news from the last two weeks. In the last several weeks, closures of various meat processing facilities in the United States that have experienced significant outbreaks of COVID-19 have put into sharp relief the challenges of maintaining our agricultural food supply chain while ensuring worker safety and protection. This week the White House stepped into the fray, with President Donald Trump issuing an executive order under the Defense Production Act delegating to the Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue the authority to “ensure the continued supply of meat and poultry” and that processors will continue operations “consistent with the guidance for operations jointly issued by and .” This move comes as concerns about COVID-19 in these plants comes to the fore. Meat and poultry processing companies have been criticized for continuing their operations without providing sufficient protective equipment, including masks, to their employees and not ensuring social distancing at the plants. A total of 15 plants had been closed by the major operators over the last weeks, affecting an estimated 25% of all beef and pork in the country. Outbreaks occurred at more than 30 plants, with at least 3,300 workers contracting the virus and 17 reported deaths. Immigrants make up a significant portion of workers across agriculture and in food processing more than a quarter of workers are foreign born, according to the Government Accountability Office. The industry has faced its share of immigration enforcement, including major raids on plants in Mississippi in August 2019. In the current concern over coronavirus, however, the president’s order designates the industry as critical and the workers needed to keep the plants open will be considered essential. Consequently, ensuring their safety and the food supply’s stability will require significant effort to protect the workers, including ensuring adequate protection and access to health care, something many immigrant workers don’t have. Trump has made opposition to so-called “sanctuary cities” a centerpiece of his campaign in 2016 and his presidency. His earliest executive orders ordered his agencies to withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that do not share information on immigrants in custody with federal enforcement agents. He upped the ante last week by stating in answer to a question about federal assistance to states and localities facing shortfalls in their budgets because of the economic fallout from COVID-19 that he would “have to talk about things like sanctuary cities” if he were to consider such assistance. The Trump administration has had mixed success in enforcing bans on federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. In cases filed against the administration by local governments in Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, and Los Angeles, federal courts and appeals courts have largely ruled that unless Congress specifically stipulates that&hellip;",

Specifically, the discussion summarized the 2020 Social Security trustees’ report and explored what assumptions might already be outdated as a result of COVID-19. Featured experts included the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration and two former public trustees of the program. You can watch the full webinar here. We also synthesized the key takeaways from the event. Check it out: The trustees’ report details the state of the two Social Security trust funds, the Old-Age &amp; Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund and the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund, and the combined status of the trust funds, referred to as the OASDI trust fund. Each year, the report informs policymakers and the public about the ability of the trust funds to meet the cost of scheduled benefits with tax revenue and trust fund reserves. The 2020 estimates were developed before the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Under that framework, reserves in the DI trust fund are estimated to be depleted in 2065, an extension of 13 years from last year’s report. OASI reserve depletion is projected to be in 2034, and the combined OASDI reserve in 2035, each the same estimate as last year’s report. Costs for Social Security have risen substantially over the past decade and are expected to keep increasing largely due to a drop in birth rates and a rise in the number of Americans retiring. Additionally, the elimination of the Affordable Care Act’s excise tax along with lower interest rates have added to the trust fund shortfall. Notably, the two public trustee positions for Social Security’s board are currently vacant. It will be crucial to fill them before the next trustees’ report so the public has confidence in the adjustments made to account for the impact of the virus. No. In 2034, for example, when OASI trust fund reserves are projected to run out, Social Security benefits will not be eliminated. Instead, they will only be paid with Social Security’s revenue (mostly payroll taxes). That revenue will only cover 76% of scheduled benefits, so beneficiaries at that time would see a 24% cut to their benefits. Some combination of curtailing the rate of benefit growth and bringing in additional tax revenue will likely be necessary, since changing either one of these enough to restore solvency is unlikely to garner bipartisan support. As the date of reserve depletion approaches, the actions needed to restore solvency become much more drastic. This is a concerning report even before the effects of COVID-19 are taken into account. With so much economic uncertainty, the biggest financial impact is likely to be a reduction in the payroll taxes that fund most of Social Security. BPC modeled a number of different scenarios to project the impacts of recessions of varying depth and length over the coming months and years. As an example, if tax revenue to Social&hellip;",

In August 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC”) published guidance on the use of proxy advisors by investment advisors and, shortly after in November, issued a proposed rule amending exemptions from the proxy rules for proxy voting advice. I have spent significant time studying shareholder voting and proxy advisors. Together with my colleagues Yao Shen and Andrey Malenko, I have published separate papers that found, respectively, that recommendations from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) can have a significant influence over shareholder voting; and that how beneficial proxy advisors’ recommendations are in informing shareholder voting depends on the firm’s ownership structure. When contributing to the SEC’s Roundtable on the proxy process in November 2018, both pieces of research were submitted in order to aid the SEC’s considerations. In submitting our paper, Andrey Malenko and I made the point that any action from the SEC should carefully consider the effects any rule would have on two aspects of the proxy advisor industry: institutional investors’ incentives to perform independent governance research; and, proxy advisors’ incentives to produce high-quality recommendations. Having reviewed the rule proposed by the SEC, I recognize there are benefits to its formulation. There remain issues around transparency and conflicts of interest in the proxy advisor industry and, in combination with the guidance issued in August, disclosure of potential conflicts of interests and enhancements to report accuracy are positive steps. Nonetheless, as with the introduction of any piece of legislation or regulation, there is a balance to be struck between the benefits and costs. The detail and explanation of the proposed rule appears to have focused on the benefits that will accrue to market participants, without necessarily weighting the potential costs of its imposition.

    "content": "On Thursday, April 30th the Bipartisan Policy Center held a virtual webinar celebrating the release of Amber McReynolds and Stephanie Donner’s new book, When Women Vote. The event also featured Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman and was moderated by Aimee Allison, founder of She The People. According to McReynolds and Donner: “When Women Vote highlights the challenges Americans, particularly women, face when trying to vote in the current voting system, and the amazing things that happen with reform.” Much like the book, Thursday’s event covered a variety of election reforms aimed at increasing voter confidence. These reforms—such as expanding vote-by-mail and ensuring poll worker safety and diversity—are especially important given the unique challenges posed to election officials by COVID-19. Secretaries of State Kim Wyman (R-WA) and Jocelyn Benson (D-MI) offered a perspective that is too often overlooked in conversations about voting: that of election officials themselves. Both Secretary Wyman and Secretary Benson shared that their foremost hope this election year was that all voters would have access to the ballot and feel confident in the results. Some additional takeaways from the Secretaries include the following: Washington, an entirely vote-by-mail state, has taken years to implement these reforms. Secretary Wyman stated, “Our laws are years in the making. Washington first allowed permanent absentee voting in 1993. We saw a dramatic rise in those choosing to vote absentee in every election since. It came to a tipping point when we began to see 60% of voters getting a ballot in the mail in every election.” Secretary Benson relayed that while the additional election funding included in the CARES Act was an important first step, “More money is needed. The $11.2 million in CARES money , in addition to the roughly 10 million earlier in the year, has allowed us to upgrade our system and pay for delivery and return of ballots for all voters. We know the eyes of the nation are on our state and we are ready.”",

    "content": "Since January 2020, countries around the world like the United States have sought to limit the movement of people to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than leading to permanent border closures and travel restrictions, countries will likely begin to expand and enhance traveler screenings and travel restrictions as a part of their routine cross-border governance in the future, a process which we call “pandemicization.” We believe that countries should look at the appropriate role of cross-border policies in responding to future pandemics and public health emergencies and pivot to a more proactive version of pandemicization to improve responses to future health threats. Pandemicization will occur in response to weaknesses in the United States’ and other countries’ efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Although cross-border policies already form part of U.S. pandemic response plans1, the Trump administration has struggled to manage the current pandemic partially because it did not implement a comprehensive cross-border mitigation strategy at the start of the crisis.2 These issues have been a longstanding problem in the United States. A 2016 U.S. Department of Homeland Security report found that the agency’s response to the 2014-16 Ebola crisis in West Africa did not have proper planning and coordination across its components, including with traveler referrals for screenings. A 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report also noted that no federal agency – including DHS and the Department of Transportation – had taken the lead in creating a national aviation preparedness plan to mitigate the spread of communicable diseases from international travelers. As a result the United States may seek to permanently integrate these types of responsive measures into their existing cross-border policies to screen for diseases and rapidly deploy mitigation measures during the initial stages of future public health emergencies, especially if they involve other novel types of diseases. It is unknown whether these changes will be reactive or proactive, however. In the case of reactive cross-border policies, these measures might resemble the current regime of restricting travel from affected countries and conducting mass quarantines of travelers from countries with wide breakouts of diseases. In contrast, a proactive approach would identify potential public health issues in other countries, develop a tailored cross-border strategy, and monitor its outcomes to improve its performance over time. This could include establishing closer coordination with other countries to respond to outbreaks, especially with accessing exit data of travelers from affected regions to track the spread of disease. While the latter approach is a dramatic improvement over the current response, the United States’ history of adopting reactive immigration policies to blunt migration crises increases the chances the country may follow a similar trajectory with pandemicization. Regardless of the direction, pandemicization could have parallels to “securitization,” the process where the United States and other countries addressed weaknesses in their immigration system’s ability to tackle terrorism after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the United States, the 9/11 Commission report noted that the State Department and the Immigration Naturalization Service were not effectively integrated into the nation’s national security&hellip;",

    "content": "U.S. Territories: U.S. Virgin Islands The U.S. Virgin Islands have identified child care as an essential service. The territory anticipates the additional CCDBG funds provided in the CARES Act will last through July. These funds are being split among three core activities: paying for either direct grants to providers (33%), or continuing subsidy payments to providers (34%), to ensure their continuing operations in the event they have closed or have decreased enrollment, and providing sanitation, cleaning supplies, or related activities (33%). They would like to provide more communication through webinars and a newsletter and would appreciate additional guidance from agencies in responding to the coronavirus. Guam Guam received $6.4 million in supplemental CCDBG funding through the CARES Act. On May 20, Rep. Michael San Nicolas (D-GU) reported that he has received complaints that providers are not receiving this funding. San Nicolas has urged the state government to make this funding available. Puerto Rico Puerto Rico received $31 million in supplemental CCDBG funding through the CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law, including $3.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Child Care and Development Block Grant to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus. This funding represents a 60% increase in total discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2020, which amounts to $9.326 billion. In general, this funding is to be administered through the CCDBG program, and therefore, the underlying program requirements apply. However, as we’ve previously detailed, Congress included additional flexibility for states to use the supplemental funds to support families currently in the greatest need, specifically essential workers with children, and so programs can access funding to respond to the difficulties caused by COVID-19. This flexibility is important to respond to the current crisis: a recent survey conducted by Morning Consult for the Bipartisan Policy Center found that 60% of providers are temporarily closed, and nearly two-thirds of parents who still need child care are having difficulty finding it. Further, about half of parents surveyed said they are concerned their provider would no longer be open when they are able to return to work and their child would need care. A survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children of providers found these concerns are justified: just 11% of providers believed they could survive the crisis without financial support. By applying these additional flexibilities to the funds provided in the CARES Act, Congress afforded states greater leeway in quickly spending the money and supporting both families and child care providers throughout this crisis. Most states have responded by spending a majority of supplemental funds on two goals in line with the CARES Act: supporting the dual needs of frontline workers and child care providers during the crisis, and covering ongoing operational costs of providers that are currently closed to ensure the supply remains intact, and child care businesses can re-open once the crisis begins to pass. At the same time, the flexibility&hellip;",

    "content": "The COVID-19 public health crisis has quickly resulted in an economic crisis that is prompting unprecedented federal action. As rescue efforts in response to the current crisis turn to recovery, modifications to DOE’s existing lending programs offer an effective and immediate path to putting federal resources to work in ways that will benefit America’s long-term economic competitiveness and create jobs quickly. Under existing DOE loan authority, $43 billion could be made available to leverage private capital in developing new energy projects—using innovative technologies such as carbon capture, small modular reactors, advanced vehicles, and energy storage—across the country. As part of the stimulus conversation, considering expansion for these programs would bring existing projects to market faster or start quickly attracting new projects that can pave the way for U.S. economic growth and increased employment. Over a decade ago, amid one of the deepest economic downturns in American history, loans and loan guarantees provided by the Department of Energy paved the way for notable innovations that accelerated growth in clean energy and electric vehicle markets. DOE’s lending programs supported more than 10,000 jobs, prompted technology advances that dramatically reduced clean-energy costs increasing affordability, and financed projects that together added enough generating capacity to power more than 1 million American homes. 1 DOE currently administers three direct loan and loan guarantee programs through its Loan Programs Office (LPO).2 The Title 17 Innovative Clean Energy Loan Guarantee Program and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program were authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, known as the EPAct. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Direct Loan Program was authorized two years later under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Over the past 10 years, DOE has issued more than $35 billion in loans to innovative projects that have created tens of thousands of jobs and reduced greenhouse gases, while still incurring only a 2.8% loss rate across its entire loan portfolio—a loss rate that many commercial lenders would envy.3 Even though a large amount of lending potential remains within these programs, they have remained relatively dormant for years. The only new loan guarantees issued in recent years went to the Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear generation plant in Georgia, which was already receiving loan guarantees under the Title 17 program. A small set of targeted improvements to DOE’s energy financing services will make federal resources more accessible to the private sector, allowing the LPO to close deals more quickly while staying true to congressional intent. 168 The Title 17 Innovative Clean Energy Loan Guarantee Program currently has more than $23 billion in remaining lending authority to support the commercial deployment of first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear, advanced fossil fuel, and renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the United States. However, structural barriers on the front and back end of the administrative process have discouraged industry from utilizing the Title 17 program in recent years. Although interest rates for Title 17 are based on Treasury rates, applicants face other costs that discourage participation. These other costs&hellip;",

    "content": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has already had profound impacts on the American people and the U.S. economy. When the immediate public health crisis passes, attention will turn from rescue to recovery efforts and to the need for public investment to support all aspects of American society. This proposal argues for the inclusion of innovative clean energy technologies in a portfolio of programs aimed at laying the foundation for a new generation of high-value American industries. The creation of a Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA), in particular, could drive a new wave of commercial activity in the energy sector, leveraging public resources and unlocking private capital to quickly scale, demonstrate and deploy innovative clean energy technologies in the United States. America has long been a leader in early-stage energy R&amp;D but in recent decades U.S. companies have struggled to demonstrate and deploy large-scale, advanced-energy projects. CEDA would help support start-ups; create jobs in the construction, engineering and innovation sectors; and help grow one of the most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy – clean energy technology. In the midst of the last recession, in 2009, bipartisan legislation was introduced in the House and the Senate to establish a new federal entity, CEDA. The idea was that an independent, business-driven federal financing agency with access to a diverse set of tools could better leverage private investment to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies developed in the United States. Securing and structuring financing for the first set of commercial projects is typically a major hurdle for new energy technologies, because these technologies have an unknown risk profile and lack a proven track record and established rate of return. Even if the technology has been successfully demonstrated at scale, costs may still be poorly understood and benefits from learning-by-doing may not be fully realized, creating the potential for cost overruns or higher initial costs. These are exceptionally challenging hurdles even in a strong economy. In the current economic environment, the case for targeted public support is even clearer. CEDA would focus its resources in two areas: “Direct support” in the form of loans, loan guarantees, letters of credit, insurance products, and other credit enhancements or debt instruments to projects employing innovative clean energy technologies that help achieve broader energy and climate goals; and “Indirect support” for projects through securitization or other means of credit enhancement. As outlined in S. 949, the 21st Century Energy Technology Deployment Act, and a companion House bill, were first introduced, on a bipartisan basis, in the 111th Congress (including a 51-6 vote in the House Energy and Commerce Committee). Under these bills, CEDA would have the right mix of independence from and access to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through a “dotted-line” relationship with the Department. Although S. 949 in its original form only transferred Title 17 loan guarantee authority to CEDA, legislation introduced in the current Congress should transfer all existing DOE lending authorities.

Ahead of the event, we review data on the state of minority business prior to the COVID-19 crisis, indications of how the crisis is affecting them, utilization of federal support programs, and signs pointing toward what the future might hold. According to the Rate of New Entrepreneurs series by the Kauffman Foundation, those Americans who identified as Black had the lowest rate of new entrepreneurship in 2018. Since 1996, the rate has increased only for Asians and Latinos. Source: Kauffman Foundation Rapid growth in Latino business creation and growth is borne out by a survey brief from the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI). They report that, over the past decade, Latinos started new businesses at “a faster rate than all other demographic groups.” The number of Latino businesses grew by 34% compared to 1% for all other groups. There are greater differences when we look at business performance. According to Kauffman, the “opportunity share of new entrepreneurs” by race and ethnicity varies: Asian: 91.95% White: 86.17% Latino: 84.75% Black: 80.5% This means that a lower share of Black entrepreneurs started their business because of opportunity rather than necessity. An analysis of Census data by researchers at the Brookings Institution found that, from 2007 to 2012, minority and women-owned businesses added 1.8 million jobs while firms owned by white men lost 800,000 jobs. (The reason, they note, has to do with “industry trends and demographic differences in ownership rates within industries.”) Yet when we pull apart the numbers, performance differences emerge. Black-owned businesses owned have lower sales, lower payroll, and lower payroll per employee than white and Hispanic-owned businesses. Source: Census Bureau, Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs. Source: Census Bureau, Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs These numbers raise concerns about how the COVID-19 crisis and recession may be affecting the near-term performance of businesses of color—and their long-term viability. Going into the crisis, EIG finds that minority-owned businesses were generally younger than others. In 2016, the latest year of Census Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs (ASE) data, nearly half (45%) of minority-owned businesses had been in business for five years or less. That compared to just under one-third (31%) of white-owned businesses. One interpretation of that data is encouraging: it shows a strong rate of new business creation by minorities. Most of that, as noted, was driven by Latinos. On the other hand, younger firms are more likely to close and they tend to be smaller—this age distribution partly explains the skew in the charts above. According to the Small Business Credit Survey from the Federal Reserve system, Black and Hispanic business owners were 40% more likely to rely on personal funds as their primary funding source. As the crisis erodes personal finances, then, we will likely see business failures result—and the impact may fall harder on business owners of color. In a&hellip;",

Serving small groups of children in a residential setting, home-based child care could be the program of choice for millions of parents as communities re-open in coming months. States should seek out policy opportunities to shore up home-based child care programs for health and safety assurance today and to prepare for the new reality of child care in the near future.      The National Survey of Early Care and Education estimates that 1 million home-based providers care for 3 million children from birth through five years old. While state and local efforts have focused primarily on child care centers during COVID-19, home-based providers are a resilient component in the overall child care system. BPC’s recent national survey, conducted by Morning Consult, shows that home-based child care, also known as family child care, are the most likely to remain open. Serving small groups of children in a trusted community-based setting, home-based child care may be the program of choice for families concerned about their children’s exposure to COVID-19 in the coming months. These programs are worthy of inclusion in state policymaking and a necessary target to ensure the stability of child care in the future. BPC offers the following recommendations to support home-based child care both now and as our country moves into a new paradigm following the current public health crisis: Make Health and Safety Paramount. In mandated business closures, some states allowed home-based child care to remain open without specific guidance, as larger center-based child care were closed or had to seek emergency waivers. As home-based child care providers in Pennsylvania demonstrate, a divided approach sows confusion for families and home-based child care programs as health and safety standards are unevenly communicated. Home-based child care programs should be included, at a minimum, in any policy decisions that impact the whole of child care and be included in stakeholder conversations with policymakers about child care. The central emphasis on health and safety should also be included as states quickly expand their pool of available child care to meet the needs of essential service workers. The federal Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 mandated health and safety requirements for both licensed and licensed-exempt providers in order participate in subsidized child care programs. As the recent CARES Act allows states to disregard income eligibility requirements when providing child care support to essential workers, states are compelled to increase the availability of child care with expediency. For instance, New Mexico is granting temporary registration to new license-exempt child care providers to provide in-home care. These temporary providers will be required to complete online health and safety training, online CPR training, and a background check before they are considered for public funding. Emphasizing that health and safety is central for all home-based child care options now will ensure best practice in regulatory enforcement&hellip;",

During the first quarter of 2020, responses to the Securities Exchange Commission’s call for comments on its proposed rules for proxy advisors reached a crescendo, with a number of institutional investors arguing that the SEC’s rulemaking was a “solution in search of a problem.” While these arguments may well have been made in good faith, they remain myopic in their evaluation of the proxy advisory system, which continues to suffer from widespread robo- or autovoting. It is understandable that this is the case as a host of investors, particularly larger ones, use proxy advisors in the way they were intended.

    "content": "An election isn’t over when the polls close. Election officials need to count ballots, audit results, and certify the election. This year they will need more time. Many states are working to expand access to mail voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are likely to see record-high rates of voting by mail across the country. Aside from the technical capacity—including scanners and trained volunteers—one easy way for legislators to assist election administrators is to allow them to process mail ballots earlier. Mail ballots take time to process. A lot of time. Here’s how the process generally works: Mail ballots arrive at local election offices in an envelope with a voter’s name and signature on the outside. Before mail ballots can be counted, election officials must verify the identity of the voter who mailed the ballot, usually by checking the voter&#8217;s signature on the absentee ballot envelope against a signature on file. Once eligibility is confirmed, ballot envelopes are sorted and placed in batches. They can then be removed from the outer envelope, separated from any privacy envelope, and fed by batch through a ballot scanner or, for smaller jurisdictions, counted by hand. The processing of ballots is quicker in some states than others. States that vote entirely or mostly by mail, like Oregon and Colorado, have automated many of these processes. But automation requires expensive machinery that most states with limited absentee voting have neither the money to purchase on a short timeline nor the need for under normal circumstances. Regardless of whether it’s a manual or automated process, most states’ laws allow election officials to get a start on processing mail ballots in advance of Election Day, recognizing the need to balance public interest in relatively quick results with sufficient time for administrators to do their jobs. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia do not. These states require mail ballot processing to be conducted on Election Day, and four of these states allow this work to begin only after the polls close. Many states usually have a low rate of mail voting and can generally manage even late start times for mail ballot processing. Voting-by-mail accounted for 23.7% of all votes cast in the 2016 election, and more than half of all states (27 + DC) had less than 10% of all votes cast through the mail. It’s when that process gets scaled up that delays in reporting even unofficial results will mount. The need for more time to count isn’t a new realization, yet states that have expanded voting by mail in recent years have also failed to address this issue. Two states that have added no-excuse absentee voting since 2016—Pennsylvania and Michigan—also require local election officials to process mail ballots on Election Day. Pennsylvania recently passed Senate Bill 422 to allow processing of absentee ballots beginning the morning of Election Day. Previously, PA was one of just four states to require election officials to wait until the polls close. While this is an improvement, it falls&hellip;",

    "content": "Correction: A previous version of this post implied employees provide their own health insurance. It has been updated to clarify businesses provide health insurance to their employees. A new BPC-Morning Consult survey finds that one-third of small businesses that have shed workers as a result of COVID-19 either do not plan to or are unsure if they can re-hire them, pouring cold water on the potential for a speedy, V-shaped economic recovery.  Indeed, infectious disease specialists have cautioned that public life could be upended for several months—if not years—due to the novel coronavirus, depending on when a viable treatment or vaccine hits the market. In the meantime, individuals will likely be required to continue practicing some level of social distancing to slow the spread, meaning that economic growth could be hampered for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, small businesses face a complex terrain of rapidly deteriorating economic conditions that threaten their survival, along with new public policies—including the Paycheck Protection Program, emergency paid leave, and expanded unemployment insurance (UI)—that impact their operations and workforce. Our polling suggests that the UI expansion in particular is factoring into employment decisions among both workers and small businesses, enabling and incentivizing businesses to reduce payroll costs and workers to stay home. While right now it is desirable to have such incentives in place, many businesses are struggling to maintain ties with their workforce. Moreover, once the country begins to transition from social distancing orders toward a resumption of business, such benefits could become a barrier to economic recovery. Many businesses have either laid off or furloughed workers, with expanded unemployment insurance impacting those decisions. 28% of small businesses have laid off workers, and 30% have furloughed workers (with roughly 40% taking at least one of these actions) Of the employers that laid off workers, 62% say that expanded unemployment insurance played a major (35%) or minor (27%) role in their decision Of the employers that furloughed workers, 61% say that expanded unemployment insurance played a major (37%) or minor (24%) role in their decision Expanded unemployment insurance may be leading some workers to quit. 16% of small businesses say that workers have quit due to reasons related to COVID-19 Of the small businesses that say employees have quit, nearly all (96%) report that at least some workers have quit to utilize expanded unemployment benefits Although most small businesses have plans to rehire furloughed workers, a significant share either do not plan to bring those workers back or are unsure if they can. Most employers plan to rehire laid off (64%) and furloughed (70%) workers However, roughly a third of employers do not plan to or are unsure if they can bring back their laid off (36%) and furloughed (30%) workers More than three-quarters of small business that provide health insurance have continued to provide that benefit to furloughed workers. Expanded unemployment insurance is making it more difficult for some small businesses to maintain their workforce during COVID-19. While a majority (56%) of small businesses say&hellip;",

And be sure to tune in to our podcast, This Week in Immigration, for even more in-depth analysis of immigration news from the last two weeks. Last Monday, President Trump declared on Twitter his intention to sign an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States. In the tweet, he cited the “need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens,” as a key rationale for the order. Over the next 48 hours, officials in his administration worked to draft such an order, which was released as a Presidential Proclamation titled “Suspending Entry of Immigrants Who Present Risk to the U.S. Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the COVID-19 Outbreak.” In contrast to the contents of Trump’s tweet, the actual proclamation only affects anyone approved for a green card who would be applying from outside the United States and exempts certain categories of immigrants. In addition to spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens, the order exempts foreign doctors, nurses or other front-line health care professionals or persons who “would be performing medical or other research to combat the spread of COVID-19 or work essential to combatting, recovering from, or otherwise alleviating the effects” of the outbreak. While the order bans all employment-based green card applicants, it does not apply to foreign investors applying under the EB-5 program. One of the requirements for that program is that the investment would create 10 direct or indirect U.S. jobs, which may be one reason the program was included. However, some employment-based immigration categories banned under the order are also subject to an economic or labor test as Congress mandated in the law. For example, outstanding professors and researchers or persons of extraordinary ability do not require labor tests as their expertise is considered to be a benefit to the United States. However, other professionals and non-professional immigrants can only be admitted after proving there are no U.S. workers available for the jobs. Should the job offer for any of these individuals go away because of the COVID recession, the petitions are invalidated, raising questions over why Trump took the extraordinary step to ban these categories outright. Late Friday, April 24, a group of plaintiffs who previously obtained a temporary restraining order against a similar proclamation barring immigrants who did not have health insurance, requested a similar order against this new proclamation from a federal judge in Oregon, at least with regard to urgent and emergency visa issuance for minor children who would “age-out” of eligibility while the proclamation is in force. From our point of view, the proclamation is an attempt by the president to substitute his desired immigration system for the one in law that he has not been successful in getting Congress to approve. Similar charges were leveled by the Trump against the DACA program, which he accused President Obama of implementing unilaterally when&hellip;",

    "content": "With states and communities having taken steps to close businesses and order residents to stay at home, business closures are shrinking the supply of child care programs at a time when essential service workers need them most. BPC’s recent national poll with Morning Consult shows that home-based child care, also known as family child care, is most likely to remain open. Home-based child care programs cannot shoulder caring for children in a public health crisis alone. This resiliency warrants investment by state policymakers. It is also imperative that state policymakers finance home-based child care strategies now to begin preparing for the future of child care. The reasons many home-based child care providers remain open are complex. With the smallest profit margin of all child care program types, home-based child care programs face significant financial pressure to keep their doors open. At the same time, home-based child care offers an advantage. Serving small groups of children, and often the same children, in a residential setting, home-based child is an ideal setting for families cautious of large gatherings in congregate care. In a recent BPC-Morning Consult poll, parents shared that their primary concern when considering returning their children to a formal child care setting is exposure to COVID-19 (75%); a higher concern than the affordability of child care (46%) or the likelihood their program of choice will be open (47%). This parental concern is unlikely to recede. As Harvard University researchers found that social distancing practice may need to continue until 2022, small home-based child care programs are a valuable option for communities as they gradually re-open their economies in future months. Particularly, states need to fund networks of home-based child care programs using the $3.5 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant in the CARES Act. Unless organized through a formalized system, supporting home-based child care programs efficiently is a significant challenge. Home-based child care programs operate independently from one another, making it costly to deploy resources quickly. Models that build networks—including shared service networks, staffed family child care networks, and Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships—create economies of scale and open gateways for state policymakers to directly access multiple home-based child care programs at once. Network structures are flexible to community need, yet they all centralize operational functions including recordkeeping, professional development resources, as well as supporting peer-to-peer interactions, creating economies of scale for home-based child care programs. For example, a new resource from Opportunities Exchange defines the potential components for staffed family child care networks. A cost estimation tool developed by the Administration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services provides an accessible resource for states to quickly determine what level of investment is needed. In addition to efficiencies, networks also provide a mechanism for states to equitably include home-based child care in the same resources and feedback loops offered to larger center-based child care programs. For home-based child care programs that remain open at this time, networks can assist in distributing health&hellip;",

    "content": "There is a curious thing to be observed about popular biographies today: the reading public can’t get enough of them. Biographies especially of presidents and figures from the American Founding, but also generals and major business leaders, have not only rocketed to the top of the best-seller lists, but even spawned Broadway musicals. And yet very few of them are written by academic historians. Instead, they tend to be written by journalists or professional non-academic writers like Ron Chernow (George Washington, Andrew Hamilton, Ulysses S. Grant, and J.P. Morgan), James Grant (Bernard Baruch), Doris Kearns Goodwin (Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln), or David McCulloch (John Adams, Harry Truman). There are some exceptions such as Yale’s David Blight, author of recent biography of Frederick Douglass, but these tend to be exceptions that prove the rule. The few academic historians like Blight who have written popular biographies are older, and withdrawn from the mainstream of academic history, like Douglas Brinkley, H.W. Brands, Andrew Roberts, Joseph Ellis, and the recently deceased Jean Edward Smith. The twists and turns of academic history may offer another clue to the deeper causes of the campus conformity that have come to stifle freedom of expression and ideological diversity today. It was not that long ago that academic historians, and leading academic presses, produced lots of biographies and narrative histories with crossover appeal to both academic and general public audiences, like the best-selling biography of Lincoln from Harvard’s David Herbert Donald back in 1996. But today biographies and general narrative histories are mostly out of fashion in the academy, though Jill Lepore’s These Truths is a significant exception, as are all of the works of John Lewis Gaddis and Sean Wilentz. I should note that both Gaddis and Wilentz are nearing retirement age, while Lepore is a crossover figure as a staff writer at The New Yorker as well as a Harvard professor—a specialist/general audience combination that was once more common. The decline of political biography and other once-thriving subfields may be related to the fact that undergraduate majors in history have been dropping through the floor over the last 20 years. In addition to shedding a public audience, academic history is shedding some of its student audience too. History is a discipline that, like political science and economics, attracts the interest of conservatives, but unlike political science and economics where conservatives are frequently found on faculties, conservatives in history departments are scarce and dwindling. This is not necessarily evidence of ideological bias. Once again, the larger story of changing trends in methodology may be more important. Academic history—especially American history—more than most other disciplines is notable for the way in which each generation sets out to overturn the dominant viewpoint and leading interpretations of the preceding generation. You can see this as far back as the Progressive Era historians like Frederick Jackson Turner, Charles Beard, Vernon Parrington, Carl Becker, Albert J. Beveridge, and James Allen Smith, who sought to overthrow the whiggish narratives of the leading&hellip;",

    "content": "The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, passed by Congress, makes several changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, established in March by the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136). In addition to new funding for the program, the legislation provides dedicated dollars to certified community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, that can help child care businesses better access funds needed during this crisis. The Paycheck Protection Program offers forgivable loans to small businesses to use for specific purposes such as covering wages, utilities, mortgages or rent, paid sick or family leave, and health insurance benefits. The new legislation increases appropriations for the PPP by $310 billion, for a total of $659 billion, as the original $359 billion in funding ran out in just weeks due to high demand. For more on the specifics of this program, please see our explainer here. Of the new funding, $250 billion is to be available for loans to businesses made by any approved lender, and $60 billion is reserved for lending by smaller institutions. Congress further split this $60 billion set-aside into two equal pots, separating which financial institutions can access each pot of funding. Specifically, two sets of $30 billion are reserved for the following categories of lenders: Community Development Financial Institutions, Small Insured Depository Institutions, and Credit Unions with less than $10 billion in assets; and Insured Depository Institutions and Credit Unions with assets of at least $10 billion but no more than $50 billion. While CDFIs were already able to participate as approved lenders in the PPP, the changes ensure a greater role for these institutions in the coming weeks. This set-aside is important and potentially very impactful for child care providers. CDFIs play a role in supporting small businesses, including child care businesses, in both rural and urban communities by providing credit and capital to those who might not otherwise qualify for traditional lending programs or be served by larger banks. Providing certified CDFIs with a specific pot of funding to lend through the PPP will increase access to loans for child care providers to help keep their programs in operation both now, and in the future, post-COVID-19. The child care industry has a significant need for forgivable loans that can ensure their businesses are still operating as the economy begins to recover. A recent survey conducted by BPC and Morning Consult found that 60% of child care programs have suspended their operations amidst the coronavirus, and that three in five parents are not paying their provider during such a closure. Further, about half of parents were concerned their provider would not weather this crisis and would not be open when they are able to return. Further, the National Association for the Education of Young Children surveyed child care providers about their experiences with the PPP and found that while around half of center-based programs and one quarter of family child care programs applied for the PPP (but had not necessarily received a PPP loan), one in four&hellip;",

    "content": "Note: This analysis has been refined and updated in a later issue brief and summary blog from the Bipartisan Policy Center. Millions of Americans depend on Social Security for their financial wellbeing. Social Security’s finances, in turn, depend largely on the strength of the economy. Recessions cut the program’s revenues and raise its costs. Social Security’s board of trustees released its 2020 annual report on the programs’ finances today, but the economic fallout from COVID-19 has become apparent too recently to be incorporated into the board’s estimates. In this blog’s preliminary analysis and a more detailed report to be released soon, we fill that gap by providing illustrative estimates of the expected economic downturn on Social Security’s finances. Our preliminary analysis finds that the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund’s reserves may be depleted during the next presidential term, and the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund’s reserves may be depleted right around the time of the 2028 presidential election. These projections reflect a substantial further deterioration in the finances of a program that was already facing a large mismatch between income and outlays, making the need for action by policymakers even more urgent. Most of the money that Social Security pays out in retirement and disability benefits comes from payroll taxes; the programs get some additional income from the taxation of benefits and interest earned on securities held by the trust funds. All three revenue sources are threatened by the current recession. A laid-off worker doesn’t pay payroll taxes (nor does the employer share of their payroll taxes get paid), and more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past five weeks. Even for workers who keep their jobs, many have experienced a cut in hours, and a slack labor market holds down wages, further depressing payroll tax revenue. Meanwhile, Social Security recipients pay taxes on their benefits if their incomes exceed $25,000 ($32,000 for a couple filing jointly). A deep recession means fewer beneficiaries will meet these thresholds—through, for example, investment income—so their benefits won’t be taxed. Finally, the Federal Reserve has responded to the crisis by cutting interest rates, which will lower the yield on bonds held by the Social Security trust funds. All of these effects make the trust funds smaller, further reducing their interest income. A recession increases program outlays, as well. When many workers lose their jobs, claiming rates for Social Security Disability Insurance typically rise. A wave of older workers who are forced to retire earlier than they had hoped would likely lead to additional claims of OASI benefits, raising costs in the short term. Because of this combination of lower revenues and higher costs, the last economic crisis significantly accelerated the depletion of reserves in the Social Security trust funds. At the start of 2008, before it was clear that the United States had plunged into a recession, Social Security’s trustees projected that the combined reserves of the retirement and disability (OASDI) trust funds would be depleted in 2041.1 In 2012, after&hellip;",

    "content": "A new survey by the Bipartisan Policy Center and Morning Consult surveying small business executives between two and 500 employees to understand how they are managing their workforce during COVID-19, finds that family and child care responsibilities due to school closures is a primary issue for small business owners. It also shows that small businesses are split on whether the new federal emergency paid sick leave and paid family leave programs enacted in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) either helped or hurt their business. However, a strong plurality of smaller-to-mid-size employers (21-500 employees) say the Act helps their business. Prior to the current crisis, 81 percent of workers did not have access to a defined paid family leave benefit and 24 percent of workers lacked a single day of paid sick leave. This gap in paid leave access in the face of a growing pandemic demonstrated that paid sick leave is a public health measure. Recent research shows that states experience 11% percent fewer flu cases within a year of enacting employee access to paid sick leave. And as social distancing mandates shifted the nation into remote work, shuttered businesses,  closed schools, and child care facilities, people across the country are quickly realizing how critical paid family leave is to the health and welfare of both employers and employees. With broad bipartisan support, the FFCRA attempted to address these needs in near term, but even the new provisions leave somewhere between 6.8 million and 19.6 million private-sector workers without paid sick or paid family leave as a result of exemptions. Many frontline and essential workers are not covered by these programs, and their employers with 500 or more employees do not get the dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit to cover costs. Moreover, as Americans return to work and continue to balance the unprecedented lack of child care and widespread school closures, the narrow focus of these programs will become more acute. Particularly when recent surveys show that three quarters of parents are concerned of their child’s potential exposure to COVID-19 when they go back to child care. Congress should continue to work with the Administration in a bipartisan fashion to further reform the paid sick and family leave provisions to support businesses and families across the country.  Small businesses employ close to half of the private-sector workforce, and new and young small businesses create nearly all net new jobs every year in the U.S. economy. Getting America back to work will rely heavily on existing small businesses reopening and new ones getting started.  Employers of all sizes will continue to struggle with workers balancing child and family caregiving responsibilities due to closures of schools, child care facilities, and adult care centers. Consequently, paid family leave will be essential to protecting workers with caregiving needs and speeding up their return to work and small business recovery. Without more robust paid leave assistance, parents will struggle to meet caregiving and work responsibilities, small businesses will fail, and we risk prolonging this economic&hellip;",

    "content": "College students have been derided as “snowflakes” who seek shelter from an open exchange of ideas. But a March report from a public flagship university underscores why that label shouldn’t stick. According to the report, a majority of liberal, moderate, and conservative students at that institution do want more opportunities to hear from and engage with their political opposites. Of course, thanks to a vocal minority, students who favor free expression have their work cut out for them: the same report shows that more than a quarter of students approve blocking a speaker with whom they disagree, and nearly a quarter of self-identified liberals and 3% of self-identified conservatives would not befriend someone with an opposing political orientation. Knowing the challenges faced by student advocates for viewpoint diversity, BPC’s Campus Free Expression Project marked Constitution Day last September with a panel discussion featuring five student leaders. The students on this panel were dedicated to promoting viewpoint diversity and a culture of open exchange on their campuses. As spring semester comes to a close, we asked our panelists to look back and share what they learned, valued, and struggled with this year—for some, their last as an undergraduate. These students had a productive year, to say the least. By working with peer organizations, collaborating with faculty and administrators, hosting events for the student body, and engaging in classroom discussion, they built up interest in and commitment to free expression values. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic throwing off short-term plans and disrupting commencements and time with friends, they remain optimistic about the impact they can have promoting open inquiry. University of Richmond junior Alec Greven believes that “the greatest challenge that I had  advancing free expression on campus has been convincing some members of my campus community that free speech and diversity are not at odds with each other.” To help show that free speech and inclusivity are compatible, “this year,” Greven said, “I was able to speak to the Faculty Senate at my school about free expression and open inquiry. The Faculty Senate coordinated with our school’s student government and the Office of the President to put together a town hall on free expression. In this forum we were able to hear a diversity of views from stakeholders at the University.” In addition, he worked closely with a professor who serves on the Free Expression Task Force, convened by the school’s president last year. “We share a lot of common interests and decided that it would be fulfilling to conduct research on the subject of free expression and open inquiry,” said Greven. Thanks to an external grant, Greven will pursue “research on speech in higher education and its relationship to democracy.” Jimmy Thompson, a senior at Brown University, served this year as president of SPEAK, a coalition of students that gathers data about ideological diversity on campus and hosts debates for the student body. He met his two objectives this year: “one was to, for the third year in a row, publish&hellip;",

On Monday, April 20, BPC hosted an e-briefing with commissioners from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), as well as state and local election officials, to dig into funding issues surrounding the 2020 elections. Below are the main topics discussed during the conversation. For greater detail, including answers to viewers questions, please see the full video.  The EAC is moving quickly to provide recently appropriated election security grants to the states, according to EAC Chairman Ben Hovland. The EAC has been in contact with every state since the passage of the CARES Act. The majority of states have submitted a request letter to receive funds, as required by the legislation, while some states have requested an extension. Once the EAC receives requests from states, the materials are processed and sent to the Treasury Department for disbursement within 24 hours.   States are using the funds to make the voting process safe for voters during the COVID-19 crisis. According to EAC Vice Chairman Donald Palmer, the most common justifications cited in states’ requests for funds include increased need for absentee ballot request forms and absentee ballots, training and recruitment of poll workers, and cleaning supplies to sanitize polling places and voting equipment.   State level officials have hard decisions to make in programming their federal assistance. Rhode Island Election Director Rob Rock said that most of the new funds are targeted for expanding vote by mail in his state. Rhode Island is currently sending postage paid ballot applications to all registered voters ahead of the June 2nd primary. The state is also planning on buying signature verification equipment to expedite mail ballot processing. Rock said Rhode Island is saving some funds for elections later in the year that may not be as heavily impacted by COVID-19. That said, he anticipates still having higher vote-by-mail numbers due to voters discovering how easy and convenient the alternative option is during the June primary.  Local election officials are on the front lines implementing reforms in response to COVID-19. Michael Winn, Administrator of Elections for Harris County, Texas – the fourth largest election jurisdiction in the country with 2.4 million registered voters – emphasized the importance of coordination across state and local election departments. The goal in his view is to create as many opportunities for voters as possible. Winn also discussed lessons learned following the Texas primary, which occurred at the beginning of the pandemic. Among other reforms, his office is encouraging vote by mail and conducting voter information campaigns, as well as reevaluating their Election Day preparedness by reviewing their facilities to ensure that countywide vote centers are in large enough spaces to accommodate social distancing requirements.  ",

Hit particularly hard have been small businesses, which employ roughly half of America’s private sector workforce. Many have been forced to close due to government shutdown orders, laying off or furloughing their employees. Once the crisis abates, many small businesses may not be able to reopen. Congress and the Administration have responded with $350 billion in loan guarantees through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and several billion more in Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL). Discussions are underway on Capitol Hill for another round of small business support. Last week, as it was announced that funding for PPP and EIDL assistance had been exhausted, the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) hosted two virtual events on “Saving Small Business.” These events brought together former Small Business Administration (SBA) officials as well as those with a ground-level view of events. (A list of panelists appears at the end of this post.) Both events were moderated by Mark Walsh, BPC board member and former SBA official. Our goals were to bring some perspective and experience to bear on the current crisis as well as its short- and long-term implications. An overriding theme of the discussions was the persistent challenge of simply coming to grips with the scale of what is happening and what is still needed. During a National League of Cities call this week, SBA Senior Advisor Ryan Lambert pointed out that, on the highest-volume day of the financial crisis a decade ago, the SBA processed around $1 billion in loan applications. On the first day of PPP, it processed $5 billion. Our panelists offered a variety of views on the current crisis. The sheer magnitude of the crisis and government response have, not surprisingly, created administrative challenges. The SBA and its network of lenders were asked to approve a decade’s worth of loans in the span of two weeks. Grafted onto existing processes that are “cumbersome” and “clunky,” this has created additional difficulties for regulators, administrators, and, not least, business owners. Nevertheless, our panelists offered praise for the work of the SBA and lenders. More help is clearly needed for small businesses, both in the form of additional financial assistance and changes that can make PPP and EIDL more effective. Four key recommendations emerged in particular from our second panel. First, restrictions on the use of PPP funds should be loosened to permit greater flexibility on the part of small businesses. This idea appears to be gaining some wider traction. Second, a “restart fund” should be created for those businesses that have already failed or will fail irrespective of government aid. Such a fund would remove the failed businesses from the existing bankruptcy system and help them deal with mounting debt and legal issues. Third, the SBA should issue simple, straightforward, unambiguous guidance on the potential penalties for non-compliance with PPP terms and conditions. Regulatory guidance has been changing nearly daily and regulators should recognize that businesses will make mistakes in their&hellip;",

    "content": "This post is the first in a series analyzing COVID-19’s impact on institutional finances. The spread of the novel coronavirus has rapidly transformed the higher education system. Classes have moved online, schools are processing refunds for room and board, and institutions face tough decisions to furlough or lay off staff. A number of schools have also announced they will suspend admissions or close entirely, a trend likely to continue due to state budget cuts and enrollment uncertainty. Unfortunately, even in normal times the federal government is ill-equipped to manage school closure or even identify institutions at risk of closing. As the crisis unfolds, policymakers must implement a streamlined, transparent, and student-centered approach to better manage school closure. Most high-profile closures in recent years have occurred among large for-profit chains—Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, for example. But many small, private nonprofit schools are also under pressure. Even before COVID-19, the closure rate was projected to climb, driven by lower enrollments due to changing demographics and a decrease in international students. In 2018, a total of 218 institutions and campuses closed in the United States, affecting roughly 100,000 enrolled students. Low-income students, students of color, and military veterans, who disproportionately enroll at for-profit colleges, are especially vulnerable to school closure. Closures often happen suddenly, leaving students in the lurch. Student borrowers have the option of federal loan forgiveness on their remaining balance, but they must give up any credits earned, sacrificing all of the time, effort, and money already invested. Taxpayers pay a price as well, given that federal student loans are lent directly by the federal government. In the case of the 2015 closure of Corinthian Colleges, roughly $80 million in student loans were discharged. Affected students may be able to participate in a teach-out plan, which financially risky institutions are required to file with their accreditor. A teach-out plan is meant to preserve pathways for students to complete their degrees—either by allowing currently enrolled students to finish their degrees at the affected institution, or through an agreement that another institution will take those students. Unfortunately, teach-out plans are often hastily designed by administrators after initiating closure and can lack necessary funding. This poses a serious risk to many students’ ability to complete their degrees, especially graduate and professional students, who struggle to find a school that will honor all of their credits. The federal government relies on a complex process to identify schools that may be at risk of closure and to implement measures to mitigate the impact on students. For private and nonprofit institutions, the Department of Education calculates a “financial responsibility score” to reflect their financial health. Institutions with low financial responsibility scores are required to post a letter of credit with the Department of Education, which is intended to offset the cost to taxpayers that can result from loan discharges and ensure funding for a teach-out plan. The Department of Education maintains broad discretion to increase the letter of credit requirement for institutions with low financial&hellip;",

    "content": "The novel coronavirus has caused complex and large-scale challenges for the higher education system. To explore policy options that can effectively address these issues, the Bipartisan Policy Center and New America recently convened experts from across the political spectrum to present “one big idea” for how higher education policy can respond to this rapidly evolving crisis. In case you missed it, we’re sharing a recap of the conversation. Michelle Asha Cooper President, Institute for Higher Education Policy Too many Americans begin college and never earn a degree, a trend that the fallout from COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate. Expanding federal funding for microgrants, small amounts of cash assistance to students for unanticipated financial shocks, could help keep more students on the path to graduation. This funding should be directed to institutions that serve large numbers of Black, Latino, and low-income students, who already face disproportionate and unique barriers to degree completion. Iris Palmer Senior Advisor for Higher Education and Workforce, New America As COVID-19 runs its course, states are going to be under extraordinary pressure to cut their higher education budgets. At the same time, institutions are processing refunds for room and board while facing enrollment uncertainty. The higher education system needs a massive influx of cash—beyond what was included in the CARES Act—to avoid large increases in tuition costs for students. A federal-state partnership would provide this support through direct block grants to states, with a federal match encouraging states to sustain investment in their higher education systems. This approach should incorporate a maintenance of effort provision that, as proposed by The Institute for College Access &amp; Success, would be waived if unemployment rates rose above a certain level. Moving forward, this partnership could include building up a rainy-day fund, like the one BPC recommends, to further smooth out funding gaps. Andrew Gillen Senior Policy Analyst, Texas Public Policy Foundation It is too early to know whether this crisis will require a fundamental restructuring of higher education, so preserving flexibility is key. Tying up all available resources in existing education patterns will inhibit the ability to make big changes down the line. Rather than funding institutions, states should convert to a model closer to what is being done at the federal level by disbursing money to students. The accreditation process requires flexibility too, as this crisis may create a need for new institutions to emerge in an evolved higher education environment. Joanna Darcus Staff Attorney, National Consumer Law Center The economic fallout from COVID-19 will only exacerbate the challenges many borrowers face in paying off their student loans. Currently, borrowers in distress—including many low-wage workers—can have their tax refunds seized. Allowing student borrowers to keep their tax refund would create a student loan safety net by providing a necessary cash infusion to those struggling the most. This direct relief has been provided as a short-term response to COVID-19, but making it permanent would serve to mitigate the student loan default crisis.

And be sure to tune in to our podcast, This Week in Immigration, for even more in-depth analysis of immigration news from the last two weeks. This week, America came to much better understand the complicated system of farmers, processors, and transportation that brings their food to the table and how hard it is for that system to quickly adjust to our new COVID reality. While farmers have for decades complained about the challenges of finding sufficient workers to pick crops and the agricultural sector in the United States has relied heavily on both undocumented and legal immigrant workers, the recent announcement of border closures, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders added concern that there would not be enough workers to bring in this year’s harvest. In response, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of Agriculture last week announced new policies for farmers who have filed applications for H-2A workers who may not be able to enter due to border restrictions. The measures allow these farmers to hire other H-2A workers already in the country and allow those workers to extend their usual 3-year stay. Earlier, the Department of Homeland Security had announced that agricultural workers would be considered “essential” for purposes of the U.S.-Mexico border crossing restrictions. However, these measures only address some of the challenges facing the food sector Farmers are concerned about the health of their workforce since any outbreak can quickly shut down operations. For instance, Smithfield had to close several of its meat and poultry processing plants due to a surge in coronavirus cases and Tysons Food had two workers die from the virus. Meanwhile, some farmers are worried that without all the institutional purchases of restaurants, schools, and cafeterias, much of the recently harvested produce will be wasted, putting farmers, particularly smaller farmers in significant financial peril. Meanwhile, advocates are asking immigrants to be treated as emergency workers and provided additional protective gear. All of these stories point out not just the fragility and importance of our agricultural and food sector, but the importance of immigrants to put food on America’s tables. This week reports emerged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has released over 700 migrants from its detention facilities across the United States as the reports of outbreaks of the disease at facilities have multiplied and are now reported at close to 90 individuals. And the overall number of detainees in the ICE system has declined to around 32,000 which is a low for the Trump administration. However, some analysts believe the decline is due to fewer arrests, rather than the release of migrants. Advocates continue to push for release of all at-risk immigrants from detention, with multiple organizations filing lawsuits demanding release, and migrants themselves are launching protests and sending videos pleading for release. Meanwhile, a judge in one of the suits have demanded that ICE provide data&hellip;",

    "content": "House Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern has just released a proposal to allow a form of remote voting. It does not address every contingency, but it is a realistic plan that is tailored to the coronavirus crisis as it exists today. The plan is not going to please technology purists who would like to see a virtual Congress operate even when we don’t face a crisis. Nor will it please extreme traditionalists who say “no way, never, not even in an emergency” will we allow a member to cast a vote from afar. The middle ground, where this proposal falls, is that in all but the most extraordinary times,  Congress should operate with its members here in Washington, interacting, debating, and voting on the floor of the House, but that in extreme emergencies when the full membership is prevented from coming together, there should be a fallback plan to allow for members to reflect their preferences on important legislative business. So, what is the plan?  It is a temporary, emergency measure to allow a limited form of proxy voting. Members who truly cannot return to the floor of the House could give detailed voting instructions to a colleague in Washington who could cast a vote for the absent member on specific matters. As the plan describes: “Under this plan, any Member unable to travel to Washington due to the pandemic could provide specific instructions for each vote to a fellow Member who has been authorized to cast those votes on their behalf. A Member casting a vote on behalf of another Member would be required to have exact direction from that Member on how to vote and would have to follow that direction. There would be no ability to give a general proxy. Members would have to direct each and every vote.” Thankfully, as bad as this health emergency is, we are unlikely to face the prospect that literally no members can return to Washington for votes. The situation we face is that Congress has not been able to function with its full membership for weeks and is not anticipating returning until the first week in May at the earliest.   And Congress will need to tackle a fourth stimulus package soon. Other important legislative business is piling up as well. The House can and has recently been operating with a handful of members in Washington.  The House often waives some rules or operates without a quorum as long as no single member objects. This has worked well, in a sense. Because we have divided government and face a grave emergency, all of our recent legislation has had to be broadly acceptable to both parties. Nothing can get passed into law without the assent of a Democratic House and a Republican Senate and president.  What this means is that big deals have been struck between Congressional leadership of both parties and chambers and the president. When those deals are struck, they can be passed through the House and Senate if&hellip;",

    "content": "There has been one constant message coming from public health experts looking to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus: wash your hands. This most basic preventative action can drastically decrease infection rates. Yet, even before this crisis began, nearly 14 million U.S. households struggled to afford their water bills and 2 million people lacked access altogether to adequate running water and basic indoor plumbing. Currently, 43 million Americans live below the poverty line. This already-vulnerable population is most likely during this public health and economic crisis to experience income disruptions, which may make it much harder to pay water bills on time. Despite state and local government stay-at-home orders, utilities in some communities have continued to issue shut-off notices and terminate water services for bill nonpayment—as we have seen in New Jersey, Florida, Missouri, and Seattle. Since no state or federal laws require water service shut-off disclosures, the examples we have are anecdotal. It is hard to accurately grasp how many households remain without water or will not be able to afford their next bill as this crisis continues. Importantly, this crisis also burdens water utilities. How each utility responds will also vary widely, in part because water services—drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater—are provided by a fragmented system of entities, both small and large, publicly and privately owned. Even within a locality, these services may all be managed by different agencies, departments, or utilities. There are more than 150,000 public drinking water systems across the country, though most Americans are served by about 40,000 “community water systems.” For wastewater and sometimes stormwater conveyance and treatment, over 14,000 “publicly owned treatment works” serve more than 238 million Americans or 76% of the U.S. population. Importantly, there are 41,000 systems serving less than 3,300 people that account for 83% of systems and 17% of the need. This network of systems is unsustainable as they struggle the most with providing clean, safe drinking water. Despite being governed and operating differently, many of these systems face a common challenge: massive maintenance backlogs and infrastructure investment needs. According to biennial needs surveys conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States has a collective 20-year water and wastewater infrastructure investment need of $743 billion. This puts utilities in a financially precarious position to help their most vulnerable customers. Longstanding water sector challenges may become even more difficult as states and localities scramble to fill budget gaps amid plummeting tax revenues, and utilities move to pause shut-offs, provide more flexible bill payment options, and help their already-aging workforce stay healthy through the pandemic. This has already led some in Congress to consider what steps must be taken to help struggling utilities and low-income households maintain water services. Utilities and policymakers, at all levels of government, are weighing options to respond to the pandemic, particularly to help struggling customers, cope with falling revenues, keep their workers healthy, and maintain services. Here we review the responses we have seen so far. Moratoriums on service shut-offs: As of&hellip;",

    "content": "As COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, continues to exponentially spread within the United States and globally, artificial intelligence has become one of the first lines of defense in the pandemic. The unprecedented pace of disease spread and data collection is challenging the medical research community to keep up with COVID-19. In a global pandemic such as this one, technology, artificial intelligence, and data science have become critical in helping societies effectively deal with the outbreak.  If properly utilized, AI can help government, industry, academia, and civil society process and utilize data and information relevant to these fields to more effectively combat the virus. Fighting COVID-19 requires extensive research in areas like bioinformatics, epidemiology, and molecular modeling to understand the threat we’re facing and form strategies to address it. The use of AI to do research in these areas and counter the pandemic demands massive computational capacity and data. Recently, the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy requested the creation of an open dataset of over 29,000 scientific articles published in journals and in publicly shared research papers. OSTP also announced the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium, bringing together the federal government, industry, and academic leaders to provide access to the world’s most powerful high-performance computing resources in support of COVID-19 research.   Hospitals are using AI to help screen and triage patients and identify those most likely to develop severe symptoms. Among the most urgent questions hospitals are facing right now is which of their COVID-19 patients are going to get worse, and how quickly will that happen? Researchers are racing to develop and validate predictive models that can answer those questions as rapidly as possible. For example, researchers from New York University, Columbia University, and two hospitals in Wenzhou, China, developed and just published an AI tool to predict whether patients will go on to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, a potentially deadly accumulation of fluid in the lungs. The new AI tool found that changes in three surprise indicators were most accurately predictive of subsequent, severe disease. Together with other factors, the team reported being able to predict risk of ARDS with up to 80% accuracy. AI is playing an important role in rapidly developing a vaccine for the coronavirus, our best long-term hope for mitigating the devastating health and economic consequences of COVID-19. Mining data in many prior studies of related coronaviruses using AI has resulted in scientists understanding the coronavirus viral protein structures, necessary knowledge for developing a vaccine. Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates have recently been announced; one already in Phase I clinical trials for safety, and others are due to start clinical trials the early fall 2020. The accelerated timeline of vaccine development and testing has been possible only through expeditiously sharing data sets using AI in public–private partnerships. Data sets collected by social media apps on smartphones have proven to be a critical tool for monitoring and responding to the rapid spread of COVID-19 in other countries such as&hellip;",

As COVID-19 spreads across the country, more governors have instituted stay-and-home orders to help flatten the pandemic curve. As a result, most schools, childcare centers and older adult meal sites have closed. For low-income families, losing access to school-based meals and other services means losing access to the consistent and healthy meals they rely on. Even before COVID-19, more than eight million seniors faced the threat of hunger or malnutrition. Consistent access to nutritious foods is essential for older adults to remain healthy and vibrant. Now that social distancing and stay-at-home directives have become the new norm, this threat has worsened. In addition to adult care centers closing, nursing homes are preventing visitors during the pandemic. Many seniors rely on these centers and their visitors to supply or supplement their daily meals. Studies show food insecurity increases the likelihood of chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, depression, high blood pressure, and heart attacks, among older adults. Maintaining food security during this pandemic is critically important as older adults are at a greater risk of severe illness and even dying. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 80% of COVID-19 deaths occur in adults 65 and older, who have obesity, diabetes, and lung and heart problems. According to Education Week’s Coronavirus and School Closures tracker, at least 124,000 public and private schools have closed &#8211; leaving more than 55 million students out of school. For many children, no school means less access to free or reduced priced breakfast and lunches. School meal programs like the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs allow students to receive healthy meals that are aligned with current nutrition science and based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Well balanced meals are help prevent chronic disease, optimize health outcomes, allow students to perform their best academically, and support better behavior. As of 2016, 14 million students participate in the School Breakfast Program and 30 million participate in the School Lunch Program. The school lunch program is the second largest anti-hunger effort after the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In fact, many students are eligible for free meals because they live in SNAP eligible households. Together, these assistance programs allow millions of children and families to eat on a daily basis. These meals aren’t just reliable, they are often necessary for some children to meet the recommended level of daily calories for healthy development. Federal and state policymakers have taken steps in the right direction to protect and expand access to nutritious meals during the coronavirus pandemic. States and school districts are thinking creatively in order to feed their students while limiting social interaction. Many school districts are setting up stations where adults can pick up prepackaged meals for students without having to check-in or wait in long lines. School districts rely primarily on cafeteria staff and volunteers to&hellip;",

Navigating, accessing, and deploying resources provided in the CARES Act may further burden capacity-strained local agencies, already consumed with addressing the COVID-19 public health crisis. State and local governments should first make use of the most flexible resources available to them—such as federal programs that have waived more burdensome rules, a wide range of eligible uses, and low or no non-federal matching. For example, Congress authorized the waiver of applicable procurement standards; consultation, citizen participation, and match requirements; and habitability and environmental review standards in the CARES Act’s emergency appropriations to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Emergency Solutions Grants program. Because these same waivers were not authorized for HUD’s Community Development Block Grant program, grant recipients may benefit from using ESG funds first and planning to use CDBG funding for future needs. While reporting requirements for federal programs vary, state and local officials likely must track, document, and provide proof of payment for labor, equipment, materials, and supplies utilized during emergency work, for example, to seek Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursement. Because there are many sources of federal funding that might be used for the same purposes by grantees, federal law also prohibits the duplication of benefits (see 42 U.S.C. 5155). Documenting and tracking costs related to COVID-19 is essential in ensure there is no duplication of benefits between FEMA funds and those provided by other federal agencies for similar uses, like HUD’s CDBG program, as doing so can result in improper payment of funds and de-obligation. Documentation is also typically required when invoking existing regulatory flexibilities for emergency situations. State and local governments are being flooded with federal resources. While acknowledging that this funding may ultimately not be enough to replace steep drops in tax revenues, an unprecedented amount of money is still flowing to state and local coffers, despite sometimes limited administrative capacity to manage these funds. At a time when unemployment is surging, states and local government agencies should make full use of federal grant program eligibilities to hire the additional staff needed to process increased funding and meet all attendant reporting and documentation requirements. To the extent possible, as the public health threat of COVID-19 begins to diminish, state and local officials should be prepared to help ramp up economic activity. Needed housing, infrastructure, and other projects have been halted to prevent the spread of COVID-19. State and local governments that can quickly get such projects back into development and simultaneously generate increased activity—above and beyond what had been planned before the crisis hit—will be able to economically bounce back more robustly. To that end, states and local communities should endeavor to get projects “shovel ready,” lining up the necessary approvals and completing other predevelopment activities to jumpstart new project construction.",

    "content": "While we are all spending more time at home during this physical-distancing phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and have more time to catch up on reading, we are sharing 10 Big Reads. We start with five Big Reads from the last year: three reports that provide much-needed data to counteract the anecdotes and headline-grabbing protests disrupting campuses; two books that diagnose why colleges struggle to foster open exchange; and five Big Reads from the seventeenth through the twentieth century about the importance of open exchange, free institutions, and diversity of voices to the discovery of knowledge and human flourishing. &nbsp; Ideological Diversity, Hostility, and Discrimination in Philosophy Uwe Peters et al. | PhilPapers | forthcoming in Philosophical Psychology An analysis of an international survey of philosophers finds that respondents were predominantly left-leaning in their political ideology; many reported experiencing hostility from colleagues based on their ideology; and a significant minority were willing to discriminate against colleagues with a different ideology. Politics on the Quad: Students Report on Division and Disagreement at Five U.S. Universities Graham Wright et al. | Brandeis University Steinhardt Social Research Institute | November 2019 Reviewing survey results from three private and two public flagship universities, the authors find that, on all five campuses, conservative students were less likely than liberal students to agree that unpopular opinions can be expressed freely. However, there were considerable differences among the five campuses, suggesting that campus climates vary greatly. The report also documents perceptions of the existence of hostile environments toward students of color and Jewish students. Free Expression and Constructive Dialogue at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Jennifer Larson et al. | University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill | March 2, 2020 The authors offer findings from their year-long investigation of UNC-Chapel Hill undergraduates’ campus experiences of political expression. The report offers 12 principal findings, including that “students across the political spectrum want more opportunities to engage with those who think differently,” and that “the current campus climate does not consistently promote free expression and constructive dialogue across the political spectrum.” Safe Enough Spaces: A Pragmatist’s Approach to Inclusion, Free Speech, and Political Correctness on College Campuses Michael S. Roth | Yale University Press | August 20, 2019 Wesleyan University president Michael S. Roth argues that colleges and universities will better carry out their educational mission by enrolling students who come from diverse communities. He argues that colleges and universities must strive to create “safe-enough” classrooms in which students feel free to express their views without fear of reprisal. President Roth spoke on these themes at a BPC Campus Free Expression panel in June 2019, which may be viewed here. The Tyranny of Virtue: Identity, the Academy, and the Hunt for Political Heresies Robert Boyers | Simon and Schuster | September 24, 2019 Skidmore College English professor Robert Boyers draws on literary critic Lionel Trilling’s concept of a “total cultural environment” to characterize today’s colleges and universities as places where a set of received ideas&hellip;",

    "content": "It is now clear that COVID-19 will have immediate and long-lasting implications for higher education as governments and institutions respond to the growing public health crisis. In the fight to “flatten the curve,” colleges and universities were some of the first large organizations to move operations online, by asking faculty and staff to meet in virtual classrooms across the country. As everyone works to do their part, Congress last month passed the third in a series of relief bills, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. The CARES Act focuses on three major areas of support for higher education: direct relief for institutions, students and borrowers; critical regulatory relief as schools move operations online and many students are unable to complete their studies; and tax relief to alleviate costs and increase employee retention. The direct relief in the Act comes from an Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), split roughly evenly between support for K-12 and higher education, which each receive approximately $14 billion. These funds will be distributed to institutions through the office of Federal Student Aid using a formula based on the number of full-time enrolled students (excluding those enrolled exclusively online) and the percentage of those who are Pell-eligible. Minority-serving institutions receive a specified portion of the funds (roughly $1 billion), and a small amount of the total can be directed by the Secretary of Education towards schools most impacted by COVID-19. Of this direct aid, at least 50% of funds for each institution must be used to provide emergency assistance to students to help ease the transition to online education and ensure they still have access to necessities like housing, food, technology, and child care. On top of the resources described above, state governors are also allocated roughly $3 billion from the ESF for direct disbursement. A state may use this funding to support their K-12 or higher education system. For most federal student loan borrowers, this legislation provides immediate relief by suspending loan interest and loan payments for six months (through September 2020). Payments suspended during this time will count towards requirements for loan forgiveness programs, ensuring that students are not knocked off track. Finally, the government will temporarily cease garnishing wages, Social Security benefits, and tax refunds for borrowers in default. The CARES Act allows the Department of Education to ease regulations on distance learning and reporting requirements. It also gives the Department and schools flexibility to access and use funds from federal grant programs while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This means schools can use federal funds like Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants as emergency grant aid to students. Another provision (Sec. 3508) ensures that neither institutions nor students will be required to repay federal financial aid for academic terms where students withdrew due to COVID-19. Importantly, any terms that a student does not complete due to COVID-19 will also not count toward the time limits prescribed for federal subsidized loans and federal Pell Grants (Sec. 3506-7).

    "content": "Wisconsin last week became the unlucky test subject for a slew of last-minute election reforms. The state was the first to conduct a major election since stay at home orders have gone into effect across much of the country in response to COVID-19. Despite election administrators’ considerable efforts, the credibility of the election was marred by unprecedented polling place closures, long lines to vote, problems processing absentee ballots, partisan court rulings, and contrary messaging from the governor, courts, and legislature.  States must learn from Wisconsin’s experience and pay close attention to the following issues that will continue to test the legitimacy of elections throughout 2020. Wisconsin localities saw astronomically long lines at polling places last Tuesday, in direct contradiction to social distancing guidelines. Both Milwaukee and Green Bay saw wait times of over two hours to vote, and pockets of even longer waits existed throughout the state.  The risk of standing among so many people to vote was particularly acute for high risk groups with comorbidities, and for persons with disabilities who may struggle to stand for long periods of time.   Furthermore, these risks were not equally distributed. BPC’s report on voting lines in 2018 found that communities with a high percentage of minority and low-income voters already wait in much longer lines than others. That was with a full slate of polling places; the problem of long waits is compounded when the mere existence of lines exposes voters to a deadly disease.   The long lines were the result of a shortage of poll workers, which necessitated polling place closures. In the lead up to Election Day, local election officials warned that poll workers feared for their health and would not show up on Election Day. As a result, Milwaukee, which usually has 180 polling places, deployed just five voting centers where any voters in the city could cast their ballot.  Poll worker recruitment will continue to be a problem throughout this election cycle. The Election Assistance Commission found that over 56% of poll workers were over the age of 60 in 2016. Additionally, nearly 65% of jurisdictions have difficulty obtaining sufficient numbers of poll workers under normal circumstances, let alone during a pandemic.  Limited access to polling places and the disproportionate impact on some demographic groups will call into question the legitimacy of this election and others that take place with similar issues during this pandemic.  Wisconsin officials attempted to alleviate pressure at the polls on Election Day by pushing voters to use the state’s no-excuse absentee voting option. Voters responded by applying for absentee ballots in unprecedented numbers. Preliminary totals already show upwards of a 313% increase in absentee ballots returned compared to the 2016 presidential preference primary.   Ramping up absentee voting from a small portion of the ballots cast to the majority of ballots cast in a short timeline is no easy task. First, the tidal wave of absentee ballot requests overwhelmed election officials. Issuing an absentee ballot is time consuming and difficult to automate, and officials lacked the staff to handle a 300% increase in applications, which caused a huge backlog in sending ballots in time for voters to return them by Election Day.   Many voters in line at polling places on Tuesday remarked that they had requested an absentee ballot, but never received it. This was the case for thousands of voters across Wisconsin, and it clearly demonstrates the logistical difficulties of ramping up absentee and voting by mail in a short timeframe.   Second, rules for accepting absentee ballots shifted several times amidst ongoing court action in Wisconsin. These shifts caused the likely disenfranchisement of hundreds, if not thousands, of voters.  The day prior to the scheduled election, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers (D) signed an executive order declaring the election&hellip;",

    "content": "President Donald Trump signed three executive orders on immigration during his first week in office. The orders focused on border security, interior enforcement, and “extreme vetting” and temporary entry bans for refugees and nationals from certain Muslim-majority countries. On February 20, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released supplemental memos with further guidance on implementing the orders. The provisions of the order and memo on interior enforcement represent a stark shift in policy and will have an immediate and significant impact on the immigration enforcement system. The president, through Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has broad authority and discretion over immigration enforcement efforts The president, through Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has broad authority and discretion over immigration enforcement efforts to remove individuals from within the country. However, because of the large unauthorized immigrant population and finite resources, it is necessary for the executive to set priorities among those eligible for removal. Trump’s interior enforcement order contains provisions that overturn and loosen more restrictive enforcement priorities created during President Obama’s time in office. The Obama administration created a list of detailed enforcement priorities with strict hierarchy. By policy, unauthorized immigrants who did not fall within the narrow priorities were essentially protected from any enforcement. On the other hand, while Trump’s removal policy seems geared to focus on “criminal” aliens, it also vaguely references broad sections of immigration law and categories of non-citizens that essentially make all unauthorized immigrants “priorities” for removal at any time. The Trump policy is governed by the overarching principle that no group of immigrants will be exempted or excluded from enforcement through prosecutorial discretion. Obama’s Enforcement Priorities Obama’s policy on removals was set in 2014 when DHS implemented enforcement priorities as part of the president’s immigration executive actions. Those enforcement policies built on the deportation priority memos issued during his first term (the so-called “Morton memos”), and focused on national security threats, immigrants convicted of serious crimes, and recent border crossers. The memo also laid out factors that should be considered when exercising prosecutorial discretion to deprioritize or not take action against otherwise removable persons, including strong family or community ties and length of time in the country. According to estimates by the Migration Policy Institute, the 2014 priories would have prioritized about 13 percent of the estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the country (even less than the 27 percent that were prioritized under the previous Morton memos). 91 The 2014 priorities had a significant impact on both the number and criminal make up of ICE removals form the interior of the country. The priorities went into effect in FY2015, but FY2016 was the first year during which the priorities were fully in force. In FY2016, 98 percent of all interior removals met one of the priorities above, and 92 percent (or about 60,000 out of 65,000 total interior removals) were convicted of a crime. Strict adherence to the priorities by ICE agents and the use of prosecutorial discretion significantly reduced overall interior removals, from&hellip;",
