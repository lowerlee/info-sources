# Profit Status

## Project Description

Profit Status is a research tool that maps the organizational landscape of information sources to promote media literacy and informed consumption of news and analysis. In an era where understanding potential biases and motivations behind information sources is crucial, this project provides transparency into whether organizations are driven by profit, public service, or governmental mandates.

The project maintains a curated database of 300+ influential information sources including major news outlets, think tanks, research institutions, fact-checking organizations, and government agencies. Each source is classified by its organizational structure (for-profit, non-profit, government, or unknown) and categorized by subject matter expertise.

This tool serves researchers, journalists, educators, and citizens who need to quickly assess the institutional background of information sources when evaluating credibility, understanding potential conflicts of interest, or ensuring diverse perspectives in their research and reporting.

## Problem

- There's over 300+ sources that I can't manually annotate the profit status for.
